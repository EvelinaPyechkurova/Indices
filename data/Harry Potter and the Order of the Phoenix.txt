CHAPTER ONE

DUDLEY DEMENTED

T

he hottest day of the summer so far was drawing to a close and
a drowsy silence lay over the large, square houses of Privet
Drive. Cars that were usually gleaming stood dusty in their drives and
lawns that were once emerald green lay parched and yellowing; the use
of hosepipes had been banned due to drought. Deprived of their usual
car-washing and lawn-mowing pursuits, the inhabitants of Privet
Drive had retreated into the shade of their cool houses, windows
thrown wide in the hope of tempting in a nonexistent breeze. The
only person left outdoors was a teenage boy who was lying flat on his
back in a flower bed outside number four.
He was a skinny, black-haired, bespectacled boy who had the
pinched, slightly unhealthy look of someone who has grown a lot in a
short space of time. His jeans were torn and dirty, his T-shirt baggy
and faded, and the soles of his trainers were peeling away from the uppers. Harry Potter’s appearance did not endear him to the neighbors,
who were the sort of people who thought scruffiness ought to be punishable by law, but as he had hidden himself behind a large hydrangea
bush this evening he was quite invisible to passersby. In fact, the only


1



CHAPTER ONE
way he would be spotted was if his Uncle Vernon or Aunt Petunia
stuck their heads out of the living room window and looked straight
down into the flower bed below.
On the whole, Harry thought he was to be congratulated on his
idea of hiding here. He was not, perhaps, very comfortable lying on
the hot, hard earth, but on the other hand, nobody was glaring at
him, grinding their teeth so loudly that he could not hear the news, or
shooting nasty questions at him, as had happened every time he had
tried sitting down in the living room and watching television with his
aunt and uncle.
Almost as though this thought had fluttered through the open window, Vernon Dursley, Harry’s uncle, suddenly spoke. “Glad to see the
boy’s stopped trying to butt in. Where is he anyway?”
“I don’t know,” said Aunt Petunia unconcernedly. “Not in the
house.”
Uncle Vernon grunted.
“Watching the news . . .” he said scathingly. “I’d like to know what
he’s really up to. As if a normal boy cares what’s on the news — Dudley hasn’t got a clue what’s going on, doubt he knows who the Prime
Minister is! Anyway, it’s not as if there’d be anything about his lot on
our news —”
“Vernon, shh!” said Aunt Petunia. “The window’s open!”
“Oh — yes — sorry, dear . . .”
The Dursleys fell silent. Harry listened to a jingle about Fruit ’N
Bran breakfast cereal while he watched Mrs. Figg, a batty, cat-loving
old lady from nearby Wisteria Walk, amble slowly past. She was
frowning and muttering to herself. Harry was very pleased that he was
concealed behind the bush; Mrs. Figg had recently taken to asking
him around for tea whenever she met him in the street. She had
rounded the corner and vanished from view before Uncle Vernon’s
voice floated out of the window again.


DUDLEY DEMENTED
“Dudders out for tea?”
“At the Polkisses’,” said Aunt Petunia fondly. “He’s got so many little friends, he’s so popular . . .”
Harry repressed a snort with difficulty. The Dursleys really were astonishingly stupid about their son, Dudley; they had swallowed all his
dim-witted lies about having tea with a different member of his gang
every night of the summer holidays. Harry knew perfectly well that
Dudley had not been to tea anywhere; he and his gang spent every
evening vandalizing the play park, smoking on street corners, and
throwing stones at passing cars and children. Harry had seen them at
it during his evening walks around Little Whinging; he had spent
most of the holidays wandering the streets, scavenging newspapers
from bins along the way.
The opening notes of the music that heralded the seven o’clock
news reached Harry’s ears and his stomach turned over. Perhaps
tonight — after a month of waiting — would be the night —
“Record numbers of stranded holidaymakers fill airports as the
Spanish baggage-handlers’ strike reaches its second week —”
“Give ’em a lifelong siesta, I would,” snarled Uncle Vernon over the
end of the newsreader’s sentence, but no matter: Outside in the flower
bed, Harry’s stomach seemed to unclench. If anything had happened,
it would surely have been the first item on the news; death and destruction were more important than stranded holidaymakers. . . .
He let out a long, slow breath and stared up at the brilliant blue sky.
Every day this summer had been the same: the tension, the expectation, the temporary relief, and then mounting tension again . . . and
always, growing more insistent all the time, the question of why nothing had happened yet. . . .
He kept listening, just in case there was some small clue, not recognized for what it really was by the Muggles — an unexplained
disappearance, perhaps, or some strange accident . . . but the


3



CHAPTER ONE
baggage-handlers’ strike was followed by news on the drought in the
Southeast (“I hope he’s listening next door!” bellowed Uncle Vernon,
“with his sprinklers on at three in the morning!”); then a helicopter
that had almost crashed in a field in Surrey, then a famous actress’s divorce from her famous husband (“as if we’re interested in their sordid
affairs,” sniffed Aunt Petunia, who had followed the case obsessively
in every magazine she could lay her bony hands on).
Harry closed his eyes against the now blazing evening sky as the
newsreader said, “And finally, Bungy the budgie has found a novel
way of keeping cool this summer. Bungy, who lives at the Five Feathers in Barnsley, has learned to water-ski! Mary Dorkins went to find
out more. . . .”
Harry opened his eyes again. If they had reached water-skiing
budgerigars, there was nothing else worth hearing. He rolled cautiously onto his front and raised himself onto his knees and elbows,
preparing to crawl out from under the window.
He had moved about two inches when several things happened in
very quick succession.
A loud, echoing crack broke the sleepy silence like a gunshot; a cat
streaked out from under a parked car and flew out of sight; a shriek, a
bellowed oath, and the sound of breaking china came from the Dursleys’ living room, and as though Harry had been waiting for this
signal, he jumped to his feet, at the same time pulling from the waistband of his jeans a thin wooden wand as if he were unsheathing a
sword. But before he could draw himself up to full height, the top of
his head collided with the Dursleys’ open window, and the resultant
crash made Aunt Petunia scream even louder.
Harry felt as if his head had been split in two; eyes streaming, he
swayed, trying to focus on the street and spot the source of the noise,
but he had barely staggered upright again when two large purple
hands reached through the open window and closed tightly around
his throat.


DUDLEY DEMENTED
“Put — it — away!” Uncle Vernon snarled into Harry’s ear. “Now!
Before — anyone — sees!”
“Get — off — me!” Harry gasped; for a few seconds they struggled, Harry pulling at his uncle’s sausage-like fingers with his left
hand, his right maintaining a firm grip on his raised wand. Then, as
the pain in the top of Harry’s head gave a particularly nasty throb, Uncle Vernon yelped and released Harry as though he had received an
electric shock — some invisible force seemed to have surged through
his nephew, making him impossible to hold.
Panting, Harry fell forward over the hydrangea bush, straightened
up, and stared around. There was no sign of what had caused the loud
cracking noise, but there were several faces peering through various
nearby windows. Harry stuffed his wand hastily back into his jeans
and tried to look innocent.
“Lovely evening!” shouted Uncle Vernon, waving at Mrs. Number
Seven, who was glaring from behind her net curtains. “Did you hear
that car backfire just now? Gave Petunia and me quite a turn!”
He continued to grin in a horrible, manic way until all the curious
neighbors had disappeared from their various windows, then the grin
became a grimace of rage as he beckoned Harry back toward him.
Harry moved a few steps closer, taking care to stop just short of the
point at which Uncle Vernon’s outstretched hands could resume their
strangling.
“What the devil do you mean by it, boy?” asked Uncle Vernon in a
croaky voice that trembled with fury.
“What do I mean by what?” said Harry coldly. He kept looking left
and right up the street, still hoping to see the person who had made
the cracking noise.
“Making a racket like a starting pistol right outside our —”
“I didn’t make that noise,” said Harry firmly.
Aunt Petunia’s thin, horsey face now appeared beside Uncle Vernon’s wide, purple one. She looked livid.


CHAPTER ONE
“Why were you lurking under our window?”
“Yes — yes, good point, Petunia! What were you doing under our
window, boy?”
“Listening to the news,” said Harry in a resigned voice.
His aunt and uncle exchanged looks of outrage.
“Listening to the news! Again?”
“Well, it changes every day, you see,” said Harry.
“Don’t you be clever with me, boy! I want to know what you’re really up to — and don’t give me any more of this listening to the news
tosh! You know perfectly well that your lot . . .”
“Careful, Vernon!” breathed Aunt Petunia, and Uncle Vernon lowered his voice so that Harry could barely hear him, “. . . that your lot
don’t get on our news!”
“That’s all you know,” said Harry.
The Dursleys goggled at him for a few seconds, then Aunt Petunia
said, “You’re a nasty little liar. What are all those —” she too lowered
her voice so that Harry had to lip-read the next word, “— owls —
doing if they’re not bringing you news?”
“Aha!” said Uncle Vernon in a triumphant whisper. “Get out of that
one, boy! As if we didn’t know you get all your news from those pestilential birds!”
Harry hesitated for a moment. It cost him something to tell the
truth this time, even though his aunt and uncle could not possibly
know how bad Harry felt at admitting it.
“The owls . . . aren’t bringing me news,” said Harry tonelessly.
“I don’t believe it,” said Aunt Petunia at once.
“No more do I,” said Uncle Vernon forcefully.
“We know you’re up to something funny,” said Aunt Petunia.
“We’re not stupid, you know,” said Uncle Vernon.
“Well, that’s news to me,” said Harry, his temper rising, and before
the Dursleys could call him back, he had wheeled about, crossed the


DUDLEY DEMENTED
front lawn, stepped over the low garden wall, and was striding off up
the street.
He was in trouble now and he knew it. He would have to face his
aunt and uncle later and pay the price for his rudeness, but he did not
care very much just at the moment; he had much more pressing matters on his mind.
Harry was sure that the cracking noise had been made by someone
Apparating or Disapparating. It was exactly the sound Dobby the
house-elf made when he vanished into thin air. Was it possible that
Dobby was here in Privet Drive? Could Dobby be following him right
at this very moment? As this thought occurred he wheeled around and
stared back down Privet Drive, but it appeared to be completely deserted again and Harry was sure that Dobby did not know how to
become invisible. . . .
He walked on, hardly aware of the route he was taking, for he had
pounded these streets so often lately that his feet carried him to his favorite haunts automatically. Every few steps he glanced back over his
shoulder. Someone magical had been near him as he lay among Aunt
Petunias dying begonias, he was sure of it. Why hadn’t they spoken to
him, why hadn’t they made contact, why were they hiding now?
And then, as his feeling of frustration peaked, his certainty leaked
away.
Perhaps it hadn’t been a magical sound after all. Perhaps he was so
desperate for the tiniest sign of contact from the world to which he
belonged that he was simply overreacting to perfectly ordinary noises.
Could he be sure it hadn’t been the sound of something breaking inside a neighbor’s house?
Harry felt a dull, sinking sensation in his stomach and, before he
knew it, the feeling of hopelessness that had plagued him all summer
rolled over him once again. . . .
Tomorrow morning he would be awoken by the alarm at five


7



CHAPTER ONE
o’clock so that he could pay the owl that delivered the Daily
Prophet — but was there any point in continuing to take it? Harry
merely glanced at the front page before throwing it aside these days;
when the idiots who ran the paper finally realized that Voldemort was
back it would be headline news, and that was the only kind Harry
cared about.
If he was lucky, there would also be owls carrying letters from his
best friends, Ron and Hermione, though any expectation he had had
that their letters would bring him news had long since been dashed.
“We can’t say much about you-know-what, obviously. . . .” “We’ve been
told not to say anything important in case our letters go astray. . . .”
“We’re quite busy but I can’t give you details here. . . .” “There’s a fair
amount going on, we’ll tell you everything when we see you. . . .”
But when were they going to see him? Nobody seemed too bothered with a precise date. Hermione had scribbled, “I expect we’ll be seeing you quite soon” inside his birthday card, but how soon was soon? As
far as Harry could tell from the vague hints in their letters, Hermione
and Ron were in the same place, presumably at Ron’s parents’ house.
He could hardly bear to think of the pair of them having fun at the
Burrow when he was stuck in Privet Drive. In fact, he was so angry at
them that he had thrown both their birthday presents of Honeydukes
chocolates away unopened, though he had regretted this after eating
the wilting salad Aunt Petunia had provided for dinner that night.
And what were Ron and Hermione busy with? Why wasn’t he,
Harry, busy? Hadn’t he proved himself capable of handling much
more than they? Had they all forgotten what he had done? Hadn’t it
been he who had entered that graveyard and watched Cedric being
murdered and been tied to that tombstone and nearly killed . . . ?
Don’t think about that, Harry told himself sternly for the hundredth
time that summer. It was bad enough that he kept revisiting the graveyard in his nightmares, without dwelling on it in his waking moments
too.


DUDLEY DEMENTED
He turned a corner into Magnolia Crescent; halfway along he
passed the narrow alleyway down the side of a garage where he had
first clapped eyes on his godfather. Sirius, at least, seemed to understand how Harry was feeling; admittedly his letters were just as empty
of proper news as Ron and Hermione’s, but at least they contained
words of caution and consolation instead of tantalizing hints:
“I know this must be frustrating for you. . . .” “Keep your nose clean
and everything will be okay. . . .” “Be careful and don’t do anything
rash. . . .”
Well, thought Harry, as he crossed Magnolia Crescent, turned into
Magnolia Road, and headed toward the darkening play park, he had
(by and large) done as Sirius advised; he had at least resisted the temptation to tie his trunk to his broomstick and set off for the Burrow
by himself. In fact Harry thought his behavior had been very good
considering how frustrated and angry he felt at being stuck in Privet
Drive this long, reduced to hiding in flower beds in the hope of hearing something that might point to what Lord Voldemort was doing.
Nevertheless, it was quite galling to be told not to be rash by a man
who had served twelve years in the wizard prison, Azkaban, escaped,
attempted to commit the murder he had been convicted for in the
first place, then gone on the run with a stolen hippogriff. . . .
Harry vaulted over the locked park gate and set off across the
parched grass. The park was as empty as the surrounding streets.
When he reached the swings he sank onto the only one that Dudley
and his friends had not yet managed to break, coiled one arm around
the chain, and stared moodily at the ground. He would not be able to
hide in the Dursleys’ flower bed again. Tomorrow he would have to
think of some fresh way of listening to the news. In the meantime, he
had nothing to look forward to but another restless, disturbed night,
because even when he escaped nightmares about Cedric he had unsettling dreams about long dark corridors, all finishing in dead ends and
locked doors, which he supposed had something to do with the


9



CHAPTER ONE
trapped feeling he had when he was awake. Often the old scar on his
forehead prickled uncomfortably, but he did not fool himself that
Ron or Hermione or Sirius would find that very interesting anymore. . . . In the past his scar hurting had warned that Voldemort was
getting stronger again, but now that Voldemort was back they would
probably remind him that its regular irritation was only to be expected. . . . Nothing to worry about . . . old news . . .
The injustice of it all welled up inside him so that he wanted to yell
with fury. If it hadn’t been for him, nobody would even have known
Voldemort was back! And his reward was to be stuck in Little Whinging for four solid weeks, completely cut off from the magical world,
reduced to squatting among dying begonias so that he could hear
about water-skiing budgerigars! How could Dumbledore have forgotten him so easily? Why had Ron and Hermione got together without
inviting him along too? How much longer was he supposed to endure
Sirius telling him to sit tight and be a good boy; or resist the temptation to write to the stupid Daily Prophet and point out that Voldemort had returned? These furious thoughts whirled around in Harry’s
head, and his insides writhed with anger as a sultry, velvety night fell
around him, the air full of the smell of warm, dry grass and the only
sound that of the low grumble of traffic on the road beyond the park
railings.
He did not know how long he had sat on the swing before the
sound of voices interrupted his musings and he looked up. The streetlamps from the surrounding roads were casting a misty glow strong
enough to silhouette a group of people making their way across the
park. One of them was singing a loud, crude song. The others were
laughing. A soft ticking noise came from several expensive racing
bikes that they were wheeling along.
Harry knew who those people were. The figure in front was unmistakably his cousin, Dudley Dursley, wending his way home, accompanied by his faithful gang.


10



DUDLEY DEMENTED
Dudley was as vast as ever, but a year’s hard dieting and the discovery of a new talent had wrought quite a change in his physique. As
Uncle Vernon delightedly told anyone who would listen, Dudley had
recently become the Junior Heavyweight Inter-School Boxing Champion of the Southeast. “The noble sport,” as Uncle Vernon called it,
had made Dudley even more formidable than he had seemed to Harry
in the primary school days when he had served as Dudley’s first
punching bag. Harry was not remotely afraid of his cousin anymore
but he still didn’t think that Dudley learning to punch harder and
more accurately was cause for celebration. Neighborhood children all
around were terrified of him — even more terrified than they were of
“that Potter boy,” who, they had been warned, was a hardened hooligan who attended St. Brutus’s Secure Center for Incurably Criminal
Boys.
Harry watched the dark figures crossing the grass and wondered
whom they had been beating up tonight. Look round, Harry found
himself thinking as he watched them. Come on . . . look round . . . I’m
sitting here all alone. . . . Come and have ago. . . .
If Dudley’s friends saw him sitting here, they would be sure to
make a beeline for him, and what would Dudley do then? He
wouldn’t want to lose face in front of the gang, but he’d be terrified of
provoking Harry. . . . It would be really fun to watch Dudley’s
dilemma; to taunt him, watch him, with him powerless to respond
. . . and if any of the others tried hitting Harry, Harry was ready — he
had his wand . . . let them try . . . He’d love to vent some of his frustration on the boys who had once made his life hell —
But they did not turn around, they did not see him, they were almost at the railings. Harry mastered the impulse to call after them.
. . . Seeking a fight was not a smart move. . . . He must not use
magic. . . . He would be risking expulsion again. . . .
Dudley’s gang’s voices died; they were out of sight, heading along
Magnolia Road.


11



CHAPTER ONE
There you go, Sirius, Harry thought dully. Nothing rash. Kept my
nose clean. Exactly the opposite of what you’d have done . . .
He got to his feet and stretched. Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon
seemed to feel that whenever Dudley turned up was the right time to
be home, and anytime after that was much too late. Uncle Vernon had
threatened to lock Harry in the shed if he came home after Dudley
again, so, stifling a yawn, still scowling, Harry set off toward the park
gate.
Magnolia Road, like Privet Drive, was full of large, square houses
with perfectly manicured lawns, all owned by large, square owners
who drove very clean cars similar to Uncle Vernon’s. Harry preferred
Little Whinging by night, when the curtained windows made patches
of jewel-bright colors in the darkness and he ran no danger of hearing
disapproving mutters about his “delinquent” appearance when he
passed the householders. He walked quickly, so that halfway along
Magnolia Road Dudley’s gang came into view again; they were saying
their farewells at the entrance to Magnolia Crescent. Harry stepped
into the shadow of a large lilac tree and waited.
“. . . squealed like a pig, didn’t he?” Malcolm was saying, to guffaws
from the others.
“Nice right hook, Big D,” said Piers.
“Same time tomorrow?” said Dudley.
“Round at my place, my parents are out,” said Gordon.
“See you then,” said Dudley.
“Bye Dud!”
“See ya, Big D!”
Harry waited for the rest of the gang to move on before setting off
again. When their voices had faded once more he headed around the
corner into Magnolia Crescent and by walking very quickly he soon
came within hailing distance of Dudley, who was strolling along at his
ease, humming tunelessly.
“Hey, Big D!”


12



DUDLEY DEMENTED
Dudley turned.
“Oh,” he grunted. “It’s you.”
“How long have you been ‘Big D’ then?” said Harry.
“Shut it,” snarled Dudley, turning away again.
“Cool name,” said Harry, grinning and falling into step beside his
cousin. “But you’ll always be Ickle Diddykins to me.”
“I said, SHUT IT!” said Dudley, whose ham-like hands had curled
into fists.
“Don’t the boys know that’s what your mum calls you?”
“Shut your face.”
“You don’t tell her to shut her face. What about ‘popkin’ and
‘Dinky Diddydums,’ can I use them then?”
Dudley said nothing. The effort of keeping himself from hitting
Harry seemed to be demanding all his self-control.
“So who’ve you been beating up tonight?” Harry asked, his grin
fading. “Another ten-year-old? I know you did Mark Evans two nights
ago —”
“He was asking for it,” snarled Dudley.
“Oh yeah?”
“He cheeked me.”
“Yeah? Did he say you look like a pig that’s been taught to walk on
its hind legs? ’Cause that’s not cheek, Dud, that’s true . . .”
A muscle was twitching in Dudley’s jaw. It gave Harry enormous
satisfaction to know how furious he was making Dudley; he felt as
though he was siphoning off his own frustration into his cousin, the
only outlet he had.
They turned right down the narrow alleyway where Harry had
first seen Sirius and which formed a shortcut between Magnolia
Crescent and Wisteria Walk. It was empty and much darker than the
streets it linked because there were no streetlamps. Their footsteps
were muffled between garage walls on one side and a high fence on
the other.


CHAPTER ONE
“Think you’re a big man carrying that thing, don’t you?” Dudley
said after a few seconds.
“What thing?”
“That — that thing you’re hiding.”
Harry grinned again.
“Not as stupid as you look, are you, Dud? But I s’pose if you were,
you wouldn’t be able to walk and talk at the same time. . . .”
Harry pulled out his wand. He saw Dudley look sideways at it.
“You’re not allowed,” Dudley said at once. “I know you’re not.
You’d get expelled from that freak school you go to.”
“How d’you know they haven’t changed the rules, Big D?”
“They haven’t,” said Dudley, though he didn’t sound completely
convinced. Harry laughed softly.
“You haven’t got the guts to take me on without that thing, have
you?” Dudley snarled.
“Whereas you just need four mates behind you before you can beat
up a ten-year-old. You know that boxing title you keep banging on
about? How old was your opponent? Seven? Eight?”
“He was sixteen for your information,” snarled Dudley, “and he was
out cold for twenty minutes after I’d finished with him and he was
twice as heavy as you. You just wait till I tell Dad you had that thing
out —”
“Running to Daddy now, are you? Is his ickle boxing champ frightened of nasty Harry’s wand?”
“Not this brave at night, are you?” sneered Dudley.
“This is night, Diddykins. That’s what we call it when it goes all
dark like this.”
“I mean when you’re in bed!” Dudley snarled.
He had stopped walking. Harry stopped too, staring at his cousin.
From the little he could see of Dudley’s large face, he was wearing a
strangely triumphant look.
“What d’you mean, I’m not brave in bed?” said Harry, completely


14



DUDLEY DEMENTED
nonplussed. “What — am I supposed to be frightened of pillows or
something?”
“I heard you last night,” said Dudley breathlessly. “Talking in your
sleep. Moaning.”
“What d’you mean?” Harry said again, but there was a cold, plunging sensation in his stomach. He had revisited the graveyard last night
in his dreams.
Dudley gave a harsh bark of laughter then adopted a high-pitched,
whimpering voice. “ ‘Don’t kill Cedric! Don’t kill Cedric!’ Who’s
Cedric — your boyfriend?”
“I — you’re lying —” said Harry automatically. But his mouth had
gone dry. He knew Dudley wasn’t lying — how else would he know
about Cedric?
“ ‘Dad! Help me, Dad! He’s going to kill me, Dad! Boo-hoo!’ ”
“Shut up,” said Harry quietly. “Shut up, Dudley, I’m warning you!”
“ ‘Come and help me, Dad! Mum, come and help me! He’s killed
Cedric! Dad, help me! He’s going to —’ Don’t you point that thing at
me!”
Dudley backed into the alley wall. Harry was pointing the wand directly at Dudley’s heart. Harry could feel fourteen years’ hatred of
Dudley pounding in his veins — what wouldn’t he give to strike now,
to jinx Dudley so thoroughly he’d have to crawl home like an insect,
struck dumb, sprouting feelers —
“Don’t ever talk about that again,” Harry snarled. “D’you understand me?”
“Point that thing somewhere else!”
“I said, do you understand me?”
“Point it somewhere else!”
“DO YOU UNDERSTAND ME?”
“GET THAT THING AWAY FROM —”
Dudley gave an odd, shuddering gasp, as though he had been
doused in icy water.

CHAPTER ONE
Something had happened to the night. The star-strewn indigo sky
was suddenly pitch-black and lightless — the stars, the moon, the
misty streetlamps at either end of the alley had vanished. The distant
grumble of cars and the whisper of trees had gone. The balmy evening
was suddenly piercingly, bitingly cold. They were surrounded by total,
impenetrable, silent darkness, as though some giant hand had
dropped a thick, icy mantle over the entire alleyway, blinding them.
For a split second Harry thought he had done magic without
meaning to, despite the fact that he’d been resisting as hard as he
could — then his reason caught up with his senses — he didn’t have
the power to turn off the stars. He turned his head this way and that,
trying to see something, but the darkness pressed on his eyes like a
weightless veil.
Dudley’s terrified voice broke in Harry’s ear.
“W-what are you d-doing? St-stop it!”
“I’m not doing anything! Shut up and don’t move!”
“I c-can’t see! I’ve g-gone blind! I —”
“I said shut up!”
Harry stood stock-still, turning his sightless eyes left and right. The
cold was so intense that he was shivering all over; goose bumps had
erupted up his arms, and the hairs on the back of his neck were standing up — he opened his eyes to their fullest extent, staring blankly
around, unseeing . . .
It was impossible. . . . They couldn’t be here. . . . Not in Little
Whinging . . . He strained his ears. . . . He would hear them before
he saw them. . . .
“I’ll t-tell Dad!” Dudley whimpered. “W-where are you? What are
you d-do — ?”
“Will you shut up?” Harry hissed, “I’m trying to lis —”
But he fell silent. He had heard just the thing he had been
dreading.
There was something in the alleyway apart from themselves, some

16



DUDLEY DEMENTED
thing that was drawing long, hoarse, rattling breaths. Harry felt a horrible jolt of dread as he stood trembling in the freezing air.
“C-cut it out! Stop doing it! I’ll h-hit you, I swear I will!”
“Dudley, shut —”
WHAM !
A fist made contact with the side of Harry’s head, lifting Harry off
his feet. Small white lights popped in front of Harry’s eyes; for the second time in an hour he felt as though his head had been cleaved in
two; next moment he had landed hard on the ground, and his wand
had flown out of his hand.
“You moron, Dudley!” Harry yelled, his eyes watering with pain, as
he scrambled to his hands and knees, now feeling around frantically in
the blackness. He heard Dudley blundering away, hitting the alley
fence, stumbling.
“DUDLEY, COME BACK! YOU’RE RUNNING RIGHT AT
IT!”
There was a horrible squealing yell, and Dudley’s footsteps
stopped. At the same moment, Harry felt a creeping chill behind him
that could mean only one thing. There was more than one.
“DUDLEY, KEEP YOUR MOUTH SHUT! WHATEVER YOU
DO, KEEP YOUR MOUTH SHUT! Wand!” Harry muttered frantically, his hands flying over the ground like spiders. “Where’s — wand
— come on — Lumos!”
He said the spell automatically, desperate for light to help him in
his search — and to his disbelieving relief, light flared inches from his
right hand — the wand tip had ignited. Harry snatched it up, scrambled to his feet, and turned around.
His stomach turned over.
A towering, hooded figure was gliding smoothly toward him,
hovering over the ground, no feet or face visible beneath its robes,
sucking on the night as it came.
Stumbling backward, Harry raised his wand.


CHAPTER ONE
“Expecto Patronum!”
A silvery wisp of vapor shot from the tip of the wand and the dementor slowed, but the spell hadn’t worked properly; tripping over his
feet, Harry retreated farther as the dementor bore down upon him,
panic fogging his brain — concentrate —
A pair of gray, slimy, scabbed hands slid from inside the dementor’s
robes, reaching for him. A rushing noise filled Harry’s ears.
“Expecto Patronum!”
His voice sounded dim and distant. . . . Another wisp of silver
smoke, feebler than the last, drifted from the wand — he couldn’t do
it anymore, he couldn’t work the spell —
There was laughter inside his own head, shrill, high-pitched laughter. . . . He could smell the dementor’s putrid, death-cold breath, filling his own lungs, drowning him — Think . . . something happy. . . .
But there was no happiness in him. . . . The dementor’s icy fingers
were closing on his throat — the high-pitched laughter was growing
louder and louder, and a voice spoke inside his head — “Bow to death,
Harry. . . . It might even be painless. . . . I would not know. . . . I have
never died. . . .”
He was never going to see Ron and Hermione again —
And their faces burst clearly into his mind as he fought for
breath —
“EXPECTO PATRONUM !”
An enormous silver stag erupted from the tip of Harry’s wand; its
antlers caught the dementor in the place where the heart should have
been; it was thrown backward, weightless as darkness, and as the stag
charged, the dementor swooped away, batlike and defeated.
“THIS WAY!” Harry shouted at the stag. Wheeling around, he
sprinted down the alleyway, holding the lit wand aloft. “DUDLEY?
DUDLEY!”
He had run barely a dozen steps when he reached them: Dudley
was curled on the ground, his arms clamped over his face; a second de

18



DUDLEY DEMENTED
mentor was crouching low over him, gripping his wrists in its slimy
hands, prizing them slowly, almost lovingly apart, lowering its hooded
head toward Dudley’s face as though about to kiss him. . . .
“GET IT!” Harry bellowed, and with a rushing, roaring sound, the
silver stag he had conjured came galloping back past him. The dementor’s eyeless face was barely an inch from Dudley’s when the silver
antlers caught it; the thing was thrown up into the air and, like its
fellow, it soared away and was absorbed into the darkness. The stag
cantered to the end of the alleyway and dissolved into silver mist.
Moon, stars, and streetlamps burst back into life. A warm breeze
swept the alleyway. Trees rustled in neighboring gardens and the mundane rumble of cars in Magnolia Crescent filled the air again. Harry
stood quite still, all his senses vibrating, taking in the abrupt return to
normality. After a moment he became aware that his T-shirt was sticking to him; he was drenched in sweat.
He could not believe what had just happened. Dementors here, in
Little Whinging . . .
Dudley lay curled up on the ground, whimpering and shaking.
Harry bent down to see whether he was in a fit state to stand up, but
then heard loud, running footsteps behind him; instinctively raising
his wand again, he spun on his heel to face the newcomer.
Mrs. Figg, their batty old neighbor, came panting into sight. Her
grizzled gray hair was escaping from its hairnet, a clanking string
shopping bag was swinging from her wrist, and her feet were halfway
out of her tartan carpet slippers. Harry made to stow his wand hurriedly out of sight, but —
“Don’t put it away, idiot boy!” she shrieked. “What if there are
more of them around? Oh, I’m going to kill Mundungus Fletcher!”

“He left!” said Mrs. Figg, wringing her hands. “Left to see
someone about a batch of cauldrons that fell off the back of a broom!
I told him I’d flay him alive if he went, and now look! Dementors! It’s
just lucky I put Mr. Tibbies on the case! But we haven’t got time to
stand around! Hurry, now, we’ve got to get you back! Oh, the trouble
this is going to cause! I will kill him!”
“But —”
The revelation that his batty old cat-obsessed neighbor knew what
dementors were was almost as big a shock to Harry as meeting two of
them down the alleyway. “You’re — you’re a witch?”
“I’m a Squib, as Mundungus knows full well, so how on earth was
I supposed to help you fight off dementors? He left you completely
without cover when I warned him —”
“This bloke Mundungus has been following me? Hang on — it
was him! He Disapparated from the front of my house!”
“Yes, yes, yes, but luckily I’d stationed Mr. Tibbies under a car just
in case, and Mr. Tibbies came and warned me, but by the time I got

to your house you’d gone — and now — oh, what’s Dumbledore going to say? You!” she shrieked at Dudley, still supine on the alley floor.
“Get your fat bottom off the ground, quick!”
“You know Dumbledore?” said Harry, staring at her.
“Of course I know Dumbledore, who doesn’t know Dumbledore?
But come on — I’ll be no help if they come back, I’ve never so much
as Transfigured a teabag —”
She stooped down, seized one of Dudley’s massive arms in her wizened hands, and tugged.
“Get up, you useless lump, get up!”
But Dudley either could not or would not move. He was still on
the ground, trembling and ashen-faced, his mouth shut very tight.
“I’ll do it.” Harry took hold of Dudley’s arm and heaved: With an
enormous effort he managed to hoist Dudley to his feet. Dudley
seemed to be on the point of fainting: His small eyes were rolling in
their sockets and sweat was beading his face; the moment Harry let go
of him he swayed dangerously.
“Hurry up!” said Mrs. Figg hysterically.
Harry pulled one of Dudley’s massive arms around his own shoulders and dragged him toward the road, sagging slightly under his
weight. Mrs. Figg tottered along in front of them, peering anxiously
around the corner.
“Keep your wand out,” she told Harry, as they entered Wisteria
Walk. “Never mind the Statute of Secrecy now, there’s going to be hell
to pay anyway, we might as well be hanged for a dragon as an egg. Talk
about the Reasonable Restriction of Underage Sorcery . . . This was
exactly what Dumbledore was afraid of — what’s that at the end of the
street? Oh, it’s just Mr. Prentice. . . . Don’t put your wand away, boy,
don’t I keep telling you I’m no use?”
It was not easy to hold a wand steady and carry Dudley along at the
same time. Harry gave his cousin an impatient dig in the ribs, but
Dudley seemed to have lost all desire for independent movement. He


21



CHAPTER TWO
was slumped on Harry’s shoulder, his large feet dragging along the
ground.
“Why didn’t you tell me you’re a Squib?” Harry asked Mrs. Figg,
panting with the effort to keep walking. “All those times I came round
your house — why didn’t you say anything?”
“Dumbledore’s orders. I was to keep an eye on you but not say anything, you were too young. I’m sorry I gave you such a miserable time,
but the Dursleys would never have let you come if they’d thought you
enjoyed it. It wasn’t easy, you know. . . . But oh my word,” she said
tragically, wringing her hands once more, “when Dumbledore hears
about this — how could Mundungus have left, he was supposed to be
on duty until midnight — where is he? How am I going to tell Dumbledore what’s happened, I can’t Apparate —”
“I’ve got an owl, you can borrow her,” Harry groaned, wondering
whether his spine was going to snap under Dudley’s weight.
“Harry, you don’t understand! Dumbledore will need to act as
quickly as possible, the Ministry have their own ways of detecting underage magic, they’ll know already, you mark my words —”
“But I was getting rid of dementors, I had to use magic — they’re
going to be more worried what dementors were doing floating around
Wisteria Walk, surely?”
“Oh my dear, I wish it were so but I’m afraid — MUNDUNGUS
FLETCHER, I AM GOING TO KILL YOU!”
There was a loud crack and a strong smell of mingled drink and
stale tobacco filled the air as a squat, unshaven man in a tattered overcoat materialized right in front of them. He had short bandy legs, long
straggly ginger hair, and bloodshot baggy eyes that gave him the doleful look of a basset hound; he was also clutching a silvery bundle that
Harry recognized at once as an Invisibility Cloak.
“ ’S’ up, Figgy?” he said, staring from Mrs. Figg to Harry and Dudley. “What ’appened to staying undercover?”


22



A PECK OF OWLS
“I’ll give you undercover!” cried Mrs. Figg. “Dementors, you useless,
skiving sneak thief!”
“Dementors?” repeated Mundungus, aghast. “Dementors here?”
“Yes, here, you worthless pile of bat droppings, here!” shrieked
Mrs. Figg. “Dementors attacking the boy on your watch!”
“Blimey,” said Mundungus weakly, looking from Mrs. Figg to
Harry and back again. “Blimey, I . . .”
“And you off buying stolen cauldrons! Didn’t I tell you not to go?
Didn’t I ?”
“I — well, I —” Mundungus looked deeply uncomfortable. “It . . .
it was a very good business opportunity, see . . .”
Mrs. Figg raised the arm from which her string bag dangled and
whacked Mundungus around the face and neck with it; judging by
the clanking noise it made it was full of cat food.
“Ouch — gerroff — gerroff, you mad old bat! Someone’s gotta tell
Dumbledore!”
“Yes — they — have!” yelled Mrs. Figg, still swinging the bag of
cat food at every bit of Mundungus she could reach. “And — it —
had — better — be — you — and — you — can — tell — him —
why — you — weren’t — there — to — help!”
“Keep your ’airnet on!” said Mundungus, his arms over his head,
cowering. “I’m going, I’m going!”
And with another loud crack, he vanished.
“I hope Dumbledore murders him!” said Mrs. Figg furiously. “Now
come on, Harry, what are you waiting for?”
Harry decided not to waste his remaining breath on pointing out
that he could barely walk under Dudley’s bulk. He gave the semiconscious Dudley a heave and staggered onward.
“I’ll take you to the door,” said Mrs. Figg, as they turned into Privet
Drive. “Just in case there are more of them around. . . . Oh my word,
what a catastrophe . . . and you had to fight them off yourself . . . and


CHAPTER TWO
Dumbledore said we were to keep you from doing magic at all costs.
. . . Well, it’s no good crying over spilled potion, I suppose . . . but the
cat’s among the pixies now . . .”
“So,” Harry panted, “Dumbledore’s . . . been having . . . me
followed?”
“Of course he has,” said Mrs. Figg impatiently. “Did you expect
him to let you wander around on your own after what happened in
June? Good Lord, boy, they told me you were intelligent. . . . Right
. . . get inside and stay there,” she said as they reached number four. “I
expect someone will be in touch with you soon enough.”
“What are you going to do?” asked Harry quickly.
“I’m going straight home,” said Mrs. Figg, staring around the dark
street and shuddering. “I’ll need to wait for more instructions. Just
stay in the house. Good night.”
“Hang on, don’t go yet! I want to know —”
But Mrs. Figg had already set off at a trot, carpet slippers flopping,
string bag clanking.
“Wait!” Harry shouted after her; he had a million questions to ask
anyone who was in contact with Dumbledore; but within seconds
Mrs. Figg was swallowed by the darkness. Scowling, Harry readjusted
Dudley on his shoulder and made his slow, painful way up number
four’s garden path.
The hall light was on. Harry stuck his wand back inside the waistband of his jeans, rang the bell, and watched Aunt Petunia’s outline
grow larger and larger, oddly distorted by the rippling glass in the
front door.
“Diddy! About time too, I was getting quite — quite — Diddy,
what’s the matter?”
Harry looked sideways at Dudley and ducked out from under his
arm just in time. Dudley swayed for a moment on the spot, his face
pale green, then he opened his mouth at last and vomited all over the
doormat.


24



A PECK OF OWLS
“DIDDY! Diddy, what’s the matter with you? Vernon? VERNON!”
Harry’s uncle came galumphing out of the living room, walrus mustache blowing hither and thither as it always did when he was agitated.
He hurried forward to help Aunt Petunia negotiate a weak-kneed
Dudley over the threshold while avoiding stepping in the pool of sick.
“He’s ill, Vernon!”
“What is it, son? What’s happened? Did Mrs. Polkiss give you
something foreign for tea?”
“Why are you all covered in dirt, darling? Have you been lying on
the ground?”
“Hang on — you haven’t been mugged, have you, son?”
Aunt Petunia screamed.
“Phone the police, Vernon! Phone the police! Diddy, darling, speak
to Mummy! What did they do to you?”
In all the kerfuffle, nobody seemed to have noticed Harry, which
suited him perfectly. He managed to slip inside just before Uncle Vernon slammed the door and while the Dursleys made their noisy
progress down the hall toward the kitchen, Harry moved carefully and
quietly toward the stairs.
“Who did it, son? Give us names. We’ll get them, don’t worry.”
“Shh! He’s trying to say something, Vernon! What is it, Diddy? Tell
Mummy!”
Harry’s foot was on the bottommost stair when Dudley found his
voice.
“Him.”
Harry froze, foot on the stair, face screwed up, braced for the
explosion.
“BOY! COME HERE!”
With a feeling of mingled dread and anger, Harry removed his foot
slowly from the stair and turned to follow the Dursleys.
The scrupulously clean kitchen had an oddly unreal glitter after the
darkness outside. Aunt Petunia was ushering Dudley into a chair; he


25



CHAPTER TWO
was still very green and clammy looking. Uncle Vernon was standing
in front of the draining board, glaring at Harry through tiny, narrowed eyes.
“What have you done to my son?” he said in a menacing growl.
“Nothing,” said Harry, knowing perfectly well that Uncle Vernon
wouldn’t believe him.
“What did he do to you, Diddy?” Aunt Petunia said in a quavering
voice, now sponging sick from the front of Dudley’s leather jacket.
“Was it — was it you-know-what, darling? Did he use — his thing?”
Slowly, tremulously, Dudley nodded.
“I didn’t!” Harry said sharply, as Aunt Petunia let out a wail and
Uncle Vernon raised his fists. “I didn’t do anything to him, it wasn’t
me, it was —”
But at that precise moment a screech owl swooped in through the
kitchen window. Narrowly missing the top of Uncle Vernon’s head, it
soared across the kitchen, dropped the large parchment envelope it
was carrying in its beak at Harry’s feet, and turned gracefully, the tips
of its wings just brushing the top of the fridge, then zoomed outside
again and off across the garden.
“OWLS!” bellowed Uncle Vernon, the well-worn vein in his temple pulsing angrily as he slammed the kitchen window shut. “OWLS
AGAIN! I WILL NOT HAVE ANY MORE OWLS IN MY
HOUSE!”
But Harry was already ripping open the envelope and pulling out
the letter inside, his heart pounding somewhere in the region of his
Adam’s apple.
Dear Mr. Potter,
We have received intelligence that you performed the Patronus Charm at twenty-three minutes past nine this evening
in a Muggle-inhabited area and in the presence of a Muggle.
The severity of this breach of the Decree for the Reason

able Restriction of Underage Sorcery has resulted in your expulsion from Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.
Ministry representatives will be calling at your place of residence shortly to destroy your wand.
As you have already received an official warning for a
previous offense under section 13 of the International Confederation of Wizards’ Statute of Secrecy, we regret to inform
you that your presence is required at a disciplinary hearing at
the Ministry of Magic at 9 a.m. on August 12th.
Hoping you are well,
Yours sincerely,

improper use of magic office
Ministry of Magic
Harry read the letter through twice. He was only vaguely aware of
Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia talking in the vicinity. Inside his
head, all was icy and numb. One fact had penetrated his consciousness like a paralyzing dart. He was expelled from Hogwarts. It was all
over. He was never going back.
He looked up at the Dursleys. Uncle Vernon was purple-faced,
shouting, his fists still raised; Aunt Petunia had her arms around Dudley, who was retching again.
Harry’s temporarily stupefied brain seemed to reawaken. Ministry
representatives will be calling at your place of residence shortly to destroy
your wand. There was only one thing for it. He would have to run —
now. Where he was going to go, Harry didn’t know, but he was certain
of one thing: At Hogwarts or outside it, he needed his wand. In an
almost dreamlike state, he pulled his wand out and turned to leave the
kitchen.


CHAPTER TWO
“Where d’you think you’re going?” yelled Uncle Vernon. When
Harry didn’t reply, he pounded across the kitchen to block the doorway into the hall. “I haven’t finished with you, boy!”
“Get out of the way,” said Harry quietly.
“You’re going to stay here and explain how my son —”
“If you don’t get out of the way I’m going to jinx you,” said Harry,
raising the wand.
“You can’t pull that one on me!” snarled Uncle Vernon. “I know
you’re not allowed to use it outside that madhouse you call a school!”
“The madhouse has chucked me out,” said Harry. “So I can do
whatever I like. You’ve got three seconds. One — two —”
A resounding CRACK filled the kitchen; Aunt Petunia screamed,
Uncle Vernon yelled and ducked, but for the third time that night
Harry was staring for the source of a disturbance he had not made. He
spotted it at once: A dazed and ruffled-looking barn owl was sitting
outside on the kitchen sill, having just collided with the closed
window.
Ignoring Uncle Vernon’s anguished yell of “OWLS!” Harry crossed
the room at a run and wrenched the window open again. The owl
stuck out its leg, to which a small roll of parchment was tied, shook its
feathers, and took off the moment Harry had pulled off the letter.
Hands shaking, Harry unfurled the second message, which was written very hastily and blotchily in black ink.
Harry —
Dumbledore’s just arrived at the Ministry, and he’s trying to
sort it all out. DO NOT LEAVE YOUR AUNT AND
UNCLE’S HOUSE. DO NOT DO ANY MORE MAGIC.
DO NOT SURRENDER YOUR WAND.

bed while Ron threw Owl Treats up on top of the wardrobe to pacify
Hedwig and Pigwidgeon, who were clattering around and rustling
their wings restlessly.
“We can’t let them out to hunt every night,” Ron explained as he
pulled on his maroon pajamas. “Dumbledore doesn’t want too many
owls swooping around the square, thinks it’ll look suspicious. Oh
yeah . . . I forgot. . . .”
He crossed to the door and bolted it.
“What’re you doing that for?”
“Kreacher,” said Ron as he turned off the light. “First night I was
here he came wandering in at three in the morning. Trust me, you
don’t want to wake up and find him prowling around your room.
Anyway . . .” He got into his bed, settled down under the covers, then
turned to look at Harry in the darkness. Harry could see his outline
by the moonlight filtering in through the grimy window. “What d’you
reckon?”
Harry didn’t need to ask what Ron meant.
“Well, they didn’t tell us much we couldn’t have guessed, did they?”
he said, thinking of all that had been said downstairs. “I mean, all
they’ve really said is that the Order’s trying to stop people joining
Vol —”
There was a sharp intake of breath from Ron.
“— demort,” said Harry firmly. “When are you going to start using
his name? Sirius and Lupin do.”
Ron ignored this last comment. “Yeah, you’re right,” he said. “We
already knew nearly everything they told us, from using the Extendable Ears. The only new bit was —”
Crack.
“OUCH!”
“Keep your voice down, Ron, or Mum’ll be back up here.”
“You two just Apparated on my knees!”
“Yeah, well, it’s harder in the dark —”

Harry saw the blurred outlines of Fred and George leaping down
from Ron’s bed. There was a groan of bedsprings and Harry’s mattress
descended a few inches as George sat down near his feet.
“So, got there yet?” said George eagerly.
“The weapon Sirius mentioned?” said Harry.
“Let slip, more like,” said Fred with relish, now sitting next to Ron.
“We didn’t hear about that on the old Extendables, did we?”
“What d’you reckon it is?” said Harry.
“Could be anything,” said Fred.
“But there can’t be anything worse than the Avada Kedavra curse,
can there?” said Ron. “What’s worse than death?”
“Maybe it’s something that can kill loads of people at once,” suggested George.
“Maybe it’s some particularly painful way of killing people,” said
Ron fearfully.
“He’s got the Cruciatus Curse for causing pain,” said Harry. “He
doesn’t need anything more efficient than that.”
There was a pause and Harry knew that the others, like him, were
wondering what horrors this weapon could perpetrate.
“So who d’you thinks got it now?” asked George.
“I hope it’s our side,” said Ron, sounding slightly nervous.
“If it is, Dumbledore’s probably keeping it,” said Fred.
“Where?” said Ron quickly. “Hogwarts?”
“Bet it is!” said George. “That’s where he hid the Sorcerer’s Stone!”
“A weapon’s going to be a lot bigger than the Stone, though!” said
Ron.
“Not necessarily,” said Fred.
“Yeah, size is no guarantee of power,” said George. “Look at
Ginny.”
“What d’you mean?” said Harry.
“You’ve never been on the receiving end of one of her Bat-Bogey
Hexes, have you?”

“Shhh!” said Fred, half-rising from the bed. “Listen!”
They fell silent. Footsteps were coming up the stairs again.
“Mum,” said George, and without further ado there was a loud
crack and Harry felt the weight vanish from the end of his bed. A few
seconds later and they heard the floorboard creak outside their door;
Mrs. Weasley was plainly listening to see whether they were talking or
not.
Hedwig and Pigwidgeon hooted dolefully. The floorboard creaked
again and they heard her heading upstairs to check on Fred and
George.
“She doesn’t trust us at all, you know,” said Ron regretfully.
Harry was sure he would not be able to fall asleep; the evening had
been so packed with things to think about that he fully expected to lie
awake for hours mulling it all over. He wanted to continue talking to
Ron, but Mrs. Weasley was now creaking back downstairs again, and
once she had gone he distinctly heard others making their way upstairs. . . . In fact, many-legged creatures were cantering softly up and
down outside the bedroom door, and Hagrid, the Care of Magical
Creatures teacher, was saying, “Beauties, aren’ they, eh, Harry? We’ll be
studyin’ weapons this term. . . .” And Harry saw that the creatures had
cannons for heads and were wheeling to face him. . . . He ducked. . . .
The next thing he knew, he was curled in a warm ball under his
bedclothes, and George’s loud voice was filling the room.
“Mum says get up, your breakfast is in the kitchen and then she needs
you in the drawing room, there are loads more doxies than she thought
and she’s found a nest of dead puffskeins under the sofa.”
Half an hour later, Harry and Ron, who had dressed and breakfasted quickly, entered the drawing room, a long, high-ceilinged room
on the first floor with olive-green walls covered in dirty tapestries. The
carpet exhaled little clouds of dust every time someone put their foot
on it and the long, moss-green velvet curtains were buzzing as though
swarming with invisible bees. It was around these that Mrs. Weasley,




CHAPTER SIX
Hermione, Ginny, Fred, and George were grouped, all looking rather
peculiar, as they had tied cloths over their noses and mouths. Each of
them was also holding a large bottle of black liquid with a nozzle at
the end.
“Cover your faces and take a spray,” Mrs. Weasley said to Harry
and Ron the moment she saw them, pointing to two more bottles of
black liquid standing on a spindle-legged table. “It’s Doxycide. I’ve
never seen an infestation this bad — what that house-elf ’s been doing
for the last ten years —”
Hermione’s face was half concealed by a tea towel but Harry distinctly saw her throw a reproachful look at Mrs. Weasley at these
words.
“Kreacher’s really old, he probably couldn’t manage —”
“You’d be surprised what Kreacher can manage when he wants to,
Hermione,” said Sirius, who had just entered the room carrying a
bloodstained bag of what appeared to be dead rats. “I’ve just been feeding Buckbeak,” he added, in reply to Harry’s inquiring look. “I keep him
upstairs in my mother’s bedroom. Anyway . . . this writing desk . . .”
He dropped the bag of rats onto an armchair, then bent over to examine the locked cabinet which, Harry now noticed for the first time,
was shaking slightly.
“Well, Molly, I’m pretty sure this is a boggart,” said Sirius, peering
through the keyhole, “but perhaps we ought to let Mad-Eye have a
shifty at it before we let it out — knowing my mother it could be
something much worse.”
“Right you are, Sirius,” said Mrs. Weasley.
They were both speaking in carefully light, polite voices that told
Harry quite plainly that neither had forgotten their disagreement of
the night before.
A loud, clanging bell sounded from downstairs, followed at once by
the cacophony of screams and wails that had been triggered the previous night by Tonks knocking over the umbrella stand.

“I keep telling them not to ring the doorbell!” said Sirius exasperatedly, hurrying back out of the room. They heard him thundering
down the stairs as Mrs. Black’s screeches echoed up through the house
once more: “Stains of dishonor, filthy half-breeds, blood traitors, children
of filth . . .”
“Close the door, please, Harry,” said Mrs. Weasley.
Harry took as much time as he dared to close the drawing room
door; he wanted to listen to what was going on downstairs. Sirius had
obviously managed to shut the curtains over his mother’s portrait because she had stopped screaming. He heard Sirius walking down the
hall, then the clattering of the chain on the front door, and then a
deep voice he recognized as Kingsley Shacklebolt’s saying, “Hestia’s
just relieved me, so she’s got Moody’s cloak now, thought I’d leave a report for Dumbledore. . . .”
Feeling Mrs. Weasley’s eyes on the back of his head, Harry regretfully closed the drawing room door and rejoined the doxy party.
Mrs. Weasley was bending over to check the page on doxies in
Gilderoy Lockhart’s Guide to Household Pests, which was lying open on
the sofa.
“Right, you lot, you need to be careful, because doxies bite and
their teeth are poisonous. I’ve got a bottle of antidote here, but I’d
rather nobody needed it.”
She straightened up, positioned herself squarely in front of the curtains, and beckoned them all forward.
“When I say the word, start spraying immediately,” she said.
“They’ll come flying out at us, I expect, but it says on the sprays one
good squirt will paralyze them. When they’re immobilized, just throw
them in this bucket.”
She stepped carefully out of their line of fire and raised her own
spray. “All right — squirt!”
Harry had been spraying only a few seconds when a fully grown
doxy came soaring out of a fold in the material, shiny beetlelike wings


CHAPTER SIX
whirring, tiny needle-sharp teeth bared, its fairylike body covered
with thick black hair and its four tiny fists clenched with fury. Harry
caught it full in the face with a blast of Doxycide; it froze in midair
and fell, with a surprisingly loud thunk, onto the worn carpet below.
Harry picked it up and threw it in the bucket.
“Fred, what are you doing?” said Mrs. Weasley sharply. “Spray that
at once and throw it away!”
Harry looked around. Fred was holding a struggling doxy between
his forefinger and thumb.
“Right-o,” Fred said brightly, spraying the doxy quickly in the face
so that it fainted, but the moment Mrs. Weasley’s back was turned he
pocketed it with a wink.
“We want to experiment with doxy venom for our Skiving Snackboxes,” George told Harry under his breath.
Deftly spraying two doxies at once as they soared straight for his
nose, Harry moved closer to George and muttered out of the corner
of his mouth, “What are Skiving Snackboxes?”
“Range of sweets to make you ill,” George whispered, keeping a
wary eye on Mrs. Weasley’s back. “Not seriously ill, mind, just ill
enough to get you out of a class when you feel like it. Fred and I have
been developing them this summer. They’re double-ended, colorcoded chews. If you eat the orange half of the Puking Pastilles, you
throw up. Moment you’ve been rushed out of the lesson for the hospital wing, you swallow the purple half —”
“ ‘— which restores you to full fitness, enabling you to pursue the
leisure activity of your own choice during an hour that would otherwise have been devoted to unprofitable boredom.’ That’s what we’re
putting in the adverts, anyway,” whispered Fred, who had edged over
out of Mrs. Weasley’s line of vision and was now sweeping a few stray
doxies from the floor and adding them to his pocket. “But they still
need a bit of work. At the moment our testers are having a bit of trouble stopping puking long enough to swallow the purple end.”

“Testers?”
“Us,” said Fred. “We take it in turns. George did the Fainting Fancies — we both tried the Nosebleed Nougat —”
“Mum thought we’d been dueling,” said George.
“Joke shop still on, then?” Harry muttered, pretending to be adjusting the nozzle on his spray.
“Well, we haven’t had a chance to get premises yet,” said Fred,
dropping his voice even lower as Mrs. Weasley mopped her brow with
her scarf before returning to the attack, “so we’re running it as a mailorder service at the moment. We put advertisements in the Daily
Prophet last week.”
“All thanks to you, mate,” said George. “But don’t worry . . . Mum
hasn’t got a clue. She won’t read the Daily Prophet anymore, ’cause of
it telling lies about you and Dumbledore.”
Harry grinned. He had forced the Weasley twins to take the thousand-Galleon prize money he had won in the Triwizard Tournament
to help them realize their ambition to open a joke shop, but he was
still glad to know that his part in furthering their plans was unknown
to Mrs. Weasley, who did not think that running a joke shop was a
suitable career for two of her sons.
The de-doxying of the curtains took most of the morning. It was
past midday when Mrs. Weasley finally removed her protective scarf,
sank into a sagging armchair, and sprang up again with a cry of disgust, having sat on the bag of dead rats. The curtains were no longer
buzzing; they hung limp and damp from the intensive spraying; unconscious doxies lay crammed in the bucket at the foot of them beside
a bowl of their black eggs, at which Crookshanks was now sniffing
and Fred and George were shooting covetous looks.
“I think we’ll tackle those after lunch.”
Mrs. Weasley pointed at the dusty glass-fronted cabinets standing
on either side of the mantelpiece. They were crammed with an odd
assortment of objects: a selection of rusty daggers, claws, a coiled


CHAPTER SIX
snakeskin, a number of tarnished silver boxes inscribed with languages
Harry could not understand and, least pleasant of all, an ornate crystal bottle with a large opal set into the stopper, full of what Harry was
quite sure was blood.
The clanging doorbell rang again. Everyone looked at Mrs. Weasley.
“Stay here,” she said firmly, snatching up the bag of rats as Mrs.
Blacks screeches started up again from down below. “I’ll bring up
some sandwiches.”
She left the room, closing the door carefully behind her. At once,
everyone dashed over to the window to look down onto the doorstep.
They could see the top of an unkempt gingery head and a stack of precariously balanced cauldrons.
“Mundungus!” said Hermione. “What’s he brought all those cauldrons for?”
“Probably looking for a safe place to keep them,” said Harry. “Isn’t
that what he was doing the night he was supposed to be tailing me?
Picking up dodgy cauldrons?”
“Yeah, you’re right!” said Fred, as the front door opened; Mundungus heaved his cauldrons through it and disappeared from view.
“Blimey, Mum won’t like that. . . .”
He and George crossed to the door and stood beside it, listening
intently. Mrs. Black’s screaming had stopped again.
“Mundungus is talking to Sirius and Kingsley,” Fred muttered,
frowning with concentration. “Can’t hear properly . . . d’you reckon
we can risk the Extendable Ears?”
“Might be worth it,” said George. “I could sneak upstairs and get a
pair —”
But at that precise moment there was an explosion of sound from
downstairs that rendered Extendable Ears quite unnecessary. All of
them could hear exactly what Mrs. Weasley was shouting at the top of
her voice.


106



THE NOBLE AND MOST
ANCIENT HOUSE OF BLACK
“WE ARE NOT RUNNING A HIDEOUT FOR STOLEN
GOODS!”
“I love hearing Mum shouting at someone else,” said Fred, with a
satisfied smile on his face as he opened the door an inch or so to allow
Mrs. Weasley’s voice to permeate the room better. “It makes such a
nice change.”
“— COMPLETELY IRRESPONSIBLE, AS IF WE HAVEN’T
GOT ENOUGH TO WORRY ABOUT WITHOUT YOU DRAGGING STOLEN CAULDRONS INTO THE HOUSE —”
“The idiots are letting her get into her stride,” said George, shaking
his head. “You’ve got to head her off early, otherwise she builds up a
head of steam and goes on for hours. And she’s been dying to have a
go at Mundungus ever since he sneaked off when he was supposed to
be following you, Harry — and there goes Sirius’s mum again —”
Mrs. Weasley’s voice was lost amid fresh shrieks and screams from
the portraits in the hall. George made to shut the door to drown the
noise, but before he could do so, a house-elf edged into the room.
Except for the filthy rag tied like a loincloth around its middle, it
was completely naked. It looked very old. Its skin seemed to be several
times too big for it and though it was bald like all house-elves, there
was a quantity of white hair growing out of its large, batlike ears. Its
eyes were a bloodshot and watery gray, and its fleshy nose was large
and rather snoutlike.
The elf took absolutely no notice of Harry and the rest. Acting as
though it could not see them, it shuffled hunchbacked, slowly and
doggedly, toward the far end of the room, muttering under its breath
all the while in a hoarse, deep voice like a bullfrog’s, “. . . Smells like
a drain and a criminal to boot, but she’s no better, nasty old blood
traitor with her brats messing up my Mistress’s house, oh my poor
Mistress, if she knew, if she knew the scum they’ve let in her house,
what would she say to old Kreacher, oh the shame of it, Mudbloods


CHAPTER SIX
and werewolves and traitors and thieves, poor old Kreacher, what can
he do. . . .”
“Hello, Kreacher,” said Fred very loudly, closing the door with a
snap.
The house-elf froze in his tracks, stopped muttering, and then gave
a very pronounced and very unconvincing start of surprise.
“Kreacher did not see Young Master,” he said, turning around and
bowing to Fred. Still facing the carpet, he added, perfectly audibly,
“Nasty little brat of a blood traitor it is.”
“Sorry?” said George. “Didn’t catch that last bit.”
“Kreacher said nothing,” said the elf, with a second bow to George,
adding in a clear undertone, “and there’s its twin, unnatural little
beasts they are.”
Harry didn’t know whether to laugh or not. The elf straightened
up, eyeing them all very malevolently, and apparently convinced that
they could not hear him as he continued to mutter.
“. . . and there’s the Mudblood, standing there bold as brass, oh if
my Mistress knew, oh how she’d cry, and there’s a new boy, Kreacher
doesn’t know his name, what is he doing here, Kreacher doesn’t
know . . .”
“This is Harry, Kreacher,” said Hermione tentatively. “Harry
Potter.”
Kreacher’s pale eyes widened and he muttered faster and more furiously than ever.
“The Mudblood is talking to Kreacher as though she is my friend,
if Kreacher’s Mistress saw him in such company, oh what would she
say —”
“Don’t call her a Mudblood!” said Ron and Ginny together, very
angrily.
“It doesn’t matter,” Hermione whispered, “he’s not in his right
mind, he doesn’t know what he’s —”


THE NOBLE AND MOST
ANCIENT HOUSE OF BLACK
“Don’t kid yourself, Hermione, he knows exactly what he’s saying,”
said Fred, eyeing Kreacher with great dislike.
Kreacher was still muttering, his eyes on Harry.
“Is it true? Is it Harry Potter? Kreacher can see the scar, it must be
true, that’s that boy who stopped the Dark Lord, Kreacher wonders
how he did it —”
“Don’t we all, Kreacher?” said Fred.
“What do you want anyway?” George asked.
Kreacher’s huge eyes darted onto George.
“Kreacher is cleaning,” he said evasively.
“A likely story,” said a voice behind Harry.
Sirius had come back; he was glowering at the elf from the doorway. The noise in the hall had abated; perhaps Mrs. Weasley and
Mundungus had moved their argument down into the kitchen. At the
sight of Sirius, Kreacher flung himself into a ridiculously low bow that
flattened his snoutlike nose on the floor.
“Stand up straight,” said Sirius impatiently. “Now, what are you up
to?”
“Kreacher is cleaning,” the elf repeated. “Kreacher lives to serve the
noble house of Black —”
“— and it’s getting blacker every day, it’s filthy,” said Sirius.
“Master always liked his little joke,” said Kreacher, bowing again,
and continuing in an undertone, “Master was a nasty ungrateful swine
who broke his mother’s heart —”
“My mother didn’t have a heart, Kreacher,” Sirius snapped. “She
kept herself alive out of pure spite.”
Kreacher bowed again and said, “Whatever Master says,” then
muttered furiously, “Master is not fit to wipe slime from his mother’s
boots, oh my poor Mistress, what would she say if she saw Kreacher
serving him, how she hated him, what a disappointment he was —”
“I asked you what you were up to,” said Sirius coldly. “Every time


109



CHAPTER SIX
you show up pretending to be cleaning, you sneak something off to
your room so we can’t throw it out.”
“Kreacher would never move anything from its proper place in
Master’s house,” said the elf, then muttered very fast, “Mistress would
never forgive Kreacher if the tapestry was thrown out, seven centuries
it’s been in the family, Kreacher must save it, Kreacher will not let
Master and the blood traitors and the brats destroy it —”
“I thought it might be that,” said Sirius, casting a disdainful look at
the opposite wall. “She’ll have put another Permanent Sticking Charm
on the back of it, I don’t doubt, but if I can get rid of it I certainly will.
Now go away, Kreacher.”
It seemed that Kreacher did not dare disobey a direct order; nevertheless, the look he gave Sirius as he shuffled out past him was redolent
of deepest loathing and he muttered all the way out of the room.
“— comes back from Azkaban ordering Kreacher around, oh my
poor Mistress, what would she say if she saw the house now, scum living in it, her treasures thrown out, she swore he was no son of hers
and he’s back, they say he’s a murderer too —”
“Keep muttering and I will be a murderer!” said Sirius irritably, and
he slammed the door shut on the elf.
“Sirius, he’s not right in the head,” said Hermione pleadingly, “I
don’t think he realizes we can hear him.”
“He’s been alone too long,” said Sirius, “taking mad orders from
my mother’s portrait and talking to himself, but he was always a foul
little —”
“If you just set him free,” said Hermione hopefully, “maybe —”
“We can’t set him free, he knows too much about the Order,” said
Sirius curtly. “And anyway, the shock would kill him. You suggest to
him that he leaves this house, see how he takes it.”
Sirius walked across the room, where the tapestry Kreacher had
been trying to protect hung the length of the wall. Harry and the others followed.


THE NOBLE AND MOST

The tapestry looked immensely old; it was faded and looked as
though doxies had gnawed it in places; nevertheless, the golden thread
with which it was embroidered still glinted brightly enough to show
them a sprawling family tree dating back (as far as Harry could tell) to
the Middle Ages. Large words at the very top of the tapestry read:
The Noble and Most Ancient House of Black
“Toujours Pur”
“You’re not on here!” said Harry, after scanning the bottom of the
tree.
“I used to be there,” said Sirius, pointing at a small, round, charred
hole in the tapestry, rather like a cigarette burn. “My sweet old mother
blasted me off after I ran away from home — Kreacher’s quite fond of
muttering the story under his breath.”
“You ran away from home?”
“When I was about sixteen,” said Sirius. “I’d had enough.”
“Where did you go?” asked Harry, staring at him.
“Your dad’s place,” said Sirius. “Your grandparents were really good
about it; they sort of adopted me as a second son. Yeah, I camped out
at your dad’s during the school holidays, and then when I was seventeen I got a place of my own, my Uncle Alphard had left me a decent
bit of gold — he’s been wiped off here too, that’s probably why —
anyway, after that I looked after myself. I was always welcome at Mr.
and Mrs. Potter’s for Sunday lunch, though.”
“But . . . why did you . . . ?”
“Leave?” Sirius smiled bitterly and ran a hand through his long, unkempt hair. “Because I hated the whole lot of them: my parents, with
their pure-blood mania, convinced that to be a Black made you practically royal . . . my idiot brother, soft enough to believe them . . .
that’s him.”
Sirius jabbed a finger at the very bottom of the tree, at the name


CHAPTER SIX
regulus black. A date of death (some fifteen years previously) followed the date of birth.
“He was younger than me,” said Sirius, “and a much better son, as
I was constantly reminded.”
“But he died,” said Harry.
“Yeah,” said Sirius. “Stupid idiot . . . he joined the Death Eaters.”
“You’re kidding!”
“Come on, Harry, haven’t you seen enough of this house to tell
what kind of wizards my family were?” said Sirius testily.
“Were — were your parents Death Eaters as well?”
“No, no, but believe me, they thought Voldemort had the right
idea, they were all for the purification of the Wizarding race, getting
rid of Muggle-borns and having purebloods in charge. They weren’t
alone either, there were quite a few people, before Voldemort showed
his true colors, who thought he had the right idea about things. . . .
They got cold feet when they saw what he was prepared to do to get
power, though. But I bet my parents thought Regulus was a right little hero for joining up at first.”
“Was he killed by an Auror?” Harry asked tentatively.
“Oh no,” said Sirius. “No, he was murdered by Voldemort. Or on
Voldemort’s orders, more likely, I doubt Regulus was ever important
enough to be killed by Voldemort in person. From what I found out
after he died, he got in so far, then panicked about what he was being
asked to do and tried to back out. Well, you don’t just hand in your
resignation to Voldemort. It’s a lifetime of service or death.”
“Lunch,” said Mrs. Weasley’s voice.
She was holding her wand high in front of her, balancing a huge
tray loaded with sandwiches and cake on its tip. She was very red in
the face and still looked angry. The others moved over to her, eager for
some food, but Harry remained with Sirius, who had bent closer to
the tapestry.

“I haven’t looked at this for years. There’s Phineas Nigellus . . . my
great-great-grandfather, see? Least popular headmaster Hogwarts ever
had . . . and Araminta Meliflua . . . cousin of my mother’s . . . tried to
force through a Ministry Bill to make Muggle-hunting legal . . . and
dear Aunt Elladora . . . she started the family tradition of beheading
house-elves when they got too old to carry tea trays . . . of course,
anytime the family produced someone halfway decent they were disowned. I see Tonks isn’t on here. Maybe that’s why Kreacher won’t
take orders from her — he’s supposed to do whatever anyone in the
family asks him. . . .”
“You and Tonks are related?” Harry asked, surprised.
“Oh yeah, her mother, Andromeda, was my favorite cousin,” said
Sirius, examining the tapestry carefully. “No, Andromeda’s not on here
either, look —”
He pointed to another small round burn mark between two names,
Bellatrix and Narcissa.
“Andromeda’s sisters are still here because they made lovely, respectable pure-blood marriages, but Andromeda married a Muggleborn, Ted Tonks, so —”
Sirius mimed blasting the tapestry with a wand and laughed sourly.
Harry, however, did not laugh; he was too busy staring at the names
to the right of Andromeda’s burn mark. A double line of gold
embroidery linked Narcissa Black with Lucius Malfoy, and a single
vertical gold line from their names led to the name Draco.
“You’re related to the Malfoys!”
“The pure-blood families are all interrelated,” said Sirius. “If you’re
only going to let your sons and daughters marry purebloods your
choice is very limited, there are hardly any of us left. Molly and I are
cousins by marriage and Arthur’s something like my second cousin
once removed. But there’s no point looking for them on here — if
ever a family was a bunch of blood traitors it’s the Weasleys.”


113



CHAPTER SIX
But Harry was now looking at the name to the left of Andromeda’s
burn: Bellatrix Black, which was connected by a double line to Rodolphus Lestrange.
“Lestrange . . .” Harry said aloud. The name had stirred something
in his memory; he knew it from somewhere, but for a moment he
couldn’t think where, though it gave him an odd, creeping sensation
in the pit of his stomach.
“They’re in Azkaban,” said Sirius shortly.
Harry looked at him curiously.
“Bellatrix and her husband Rodolphus came in with Barty Crouch,
Junior,” said Sirius in the same brusque voice. “Rodolphus’s brother,
Rabastan, was with them too.”
And Harry remembered: He had seen Bellatrix Lestrange inside
Dumbledore’s Pensieve, the strange device in which thoughts and
memories could be stored: a tall dark woman with heavy-lidded eyes,
who had stood at her trial and proclaimed her continuing allegiance to
Lord Voldemort, her pride that she had tried to find him after his
downfall and her conviction that she would one day be rewarded for
her loyalty.
“You never said she was your —”
“Does it matter if she’s my cousin?” snapped Sirius. “As far as I’m
concerned, they’re not my family. She’s certainly not my family. I
haven’t seen her since I was your age, unless you count a glimpse of her
coming in to Azkaban. D’you think I’m proud of having relatives like
her?”
“Sorry,” said Harry quickly, “I didn’t mean — I was just surprised,
that’s all —”
“It doesn’t matter, don’t apologize,” Sirius mumbled at once. He
turned away from the tapestry, his hands deep in his pockets. “I don’t
like being back here,” he said, staring across the drawing room. “I
never thought I’d be stuck in this house again.”
Harry understood completely. He knew how he would feel if


114



THE NOBLE AND MOST
ANCIENT HOUSE OF BLACK
forced, when he was grown up and thought he was free of the place
forever, to return and live at number four, Privet Drive.
“It’s ideal for headquarters, of course,” Sirius said. “My father put
every security measure known to Wizard-kind on it when he lived
here. It’s Unplottable, so Muggles could never come and call — as if
they’d have wanted to — and now Dumbledore’s added his protection, you’d be hard put to find a safer house anywhere. Dumbledore’s
Secret-Keeper for the Order, you know — nobody can find headquarters unless he tells them personally where it is — that note Moody
showed you last night, that was from Dumbledore. . . .” Sirius gave a
short, barklike laugh. “If my parents could see the use it was being put
to now . . . well, my mother’s portrait should give you some idea. . . .”
He scowled for a moment, then sighed.
“I wouldn’t mind if I could just get out occasionally and do something useful. I’ve asked Dumbledore whether I can escort you to your
hearing — as Snuffles, obviously — so I can give you a bit of moral
support, what d’you think?”
Harry felt as though his stomach had sunk through the dusty
carpet. He had not thought about the hearing once since dinner the
previous evening; in the excitement of being back with the people he
liked best, of hearing everything that was going on, it had completely
flown his mind. At Sirius’s words, however, the crushing sense of
dread returned to him. He stared at Hermione and the Weasleys, all
tucking into their sandwiches, and thought how he would feel if they
went back to Hogwarts without him.
“Don’t worry,” Sirius said. Harry looked up and realized that Sirius
had been watching him. “I’m sure they’re going to clear you, there’s
definitely something in the International Statute of Secrecy about being allowed to use magic to save your own life.”
“But if they do expel me,” said Harry, quietly, “can I come back
here and live with you?”
Sirius smiled sadly.


CHAPTER SIX
“We’ll see.”
“I’d feel a lot better about the hearing if I knew I didn’t have to go
back to the Dursleys,” Harry pressed him.
“They must be bad if you prefer this place,” said Sirius gloomily.
“Hurry up, you two, or there won’t be any food left,” Mrs. Weasley
called.
Sirius heaved another great sigh, cast a dark look at the tapestry,
and he and Harry went to join the others.
Harry tried his best not to think about the hearing while they emptied the glass cabinets that afternoon. Fortunately for him, it was a job
that required a lot of concentration, as many of the objects in there
seemed very reluctant to leave their dusty shelves. Sirius sustained a
bad bite from a silver snuffbox; within seconds, his bitten hand had
developed an unpleasant crusty covering like a tough brown glove.
“It’s okay,” he said, examining the hand with interest before tapping it lightly with his wand and restoring its skin to normal, “must
be Wartcap powder in there.”
He threw the box aside into the sack where they were depositing
the debris from the cabinets; Harry saw George wrap his own hand
carefully in a cloth moments later and sneak the box into his already
doxy-filled pocket.
They found an unpleasant-looking silver instrument, something
like a many-legged pair of tweezers, which scuttled up Harry’s arm
like a spider when he picked it up, and attempted to puncture his
skin; Sirius seized it and smashed it with a heavy book entitled
Nature’s Nobility: A Wizarding Genealogy. There was a musical box
that emitted a faintly sinister, tinkling tune when wound, and they all
found themselves becoming curiously weak and sleepy until Ginny
had the sense to slam the lid shut; also a heavy locket that none of
them could open, a number of ancient seals and, in a dusty box, an
Order of Merlin, First Class, that had been awarded to Sirius’s grandfather for “Services to the Ministry.”

“It means he gave them a load of gold,” said Sirius contemptuously,
throwing the medal into the rubbish sack.
Several times, Kreacher sidled into the room and attempted to
smuggle things away under his loincloth, muttering horrible curses
every time they caught him at it. When Sirius wrested a large golden
ring bearing the Black crest from his grip Kreacher actually burst into
furious tears and left the room sobbing under his breath and calling
Sirius names Harry had never heard before.
“It was my father’s,” said Sirius, throwing the ring into the sack.
“Kreacher wasn’t quite as devoted to him as to my mother, but I still
caught him snogging a pair of my father’s old trousers last week.”
Mrs. Weasley kept them all working very hard over the next few days.
The drawing room took three days to decontaminate; finally the only
undesirable things left in it were the tapestry of the Black family tree,
which resisted all their attempts to remove it from the wall, and the
rattling writing desk; Moody had not dropped by headquarters yet, so
they could not be sure what was inside it.
They moved from the drawing room to a dining room on the
ground floor where they found spiders large as saucers lurking in the
dresser (Ron left the room hurriedly to make a cup of tea and did not
return for an hour and a half). The china, which bore the Black crest
and motto, was all thrown unceremoniously into a sack by Sirius, and
the same fate met a set of old photographs in tarnished silver frames,
all of whose occupants squealed shrilly as the glass covering them
smashed.
Snape might refer to their work as “cleaning,” but in Harry’s opinion they were really waging war on the house, which was putting up a
very good fight, aided and abetted by Kreacher. The house-elf kept
appearing wherever they were congregated, his muttering becoming
more and more offensive as he attempted to remove anything he
could from the rubbish sacks. Sirius went as far as to threaten him


CHAPTER SIX
with clothes, but Kreacher fixed him with a watery stare and said,
“Master must do as Master wishes,” before turning away and muttering very loudly, “but Master will not turn Kreacher away, no, because
Kreacher knows what they are up to, oh yes, he is plotting against the
Dark Lord, yes, with these Mudbloods and traitors and scum. . . .”
At which Sirius, ignoring Hermione’s protests, seized Kreacher by
the back of his loincloth and threw him bodily from the room.
The doorbell rang several times a day, which was the cue for Sirius’s
mother to start shrieking again, and for Harry and the others to attempt to eavesdrop on the visitor, though they gleaned very little from
the brief glimpses and snatches of conversation they were able to
sneak before Mrs. Weasley recalled them to their tasks. Snape flitted in
and out of the house several times more, though to Harry’s relief they
never came face-to-face; he also caught sight of his Transfiguration
teacher, Professor McGonagall, looking very odd in a Muggle dress
and coat, though she also seemed too busy to linger.
Sometimes, however, the visitors stayed to help; Tonks joined them
for a memorable afternoon in which they found a murderous old
ghoul lurking in an upstairs toilet, and Lupin, who was staying in the
house with Sirius but who left it for long periods to do mysterious
work for the Order, helped them repair a grandfather clock that had
developed the unpleasant habit of shooting heavy bolts at passersby.
Mundungus redeemed himself slightly in Mrs. Weasley’s eyes by rescuing Ron from an ancient set of purple robes that had tried to strangle him when he removed them from their wardrobe.
Despite the fact that he was still sleeping badly, still having dreams
about corridors and locked doors that made his scar prickle, Harry
was managing to have fun for the first time all summer. As long as he
was busy he was happy; when the action abated, however, whenever
he dropped his guard, or lay exhausted in bed watching blurred shadows move across the ceiling, the thought of the looming Ministry


ANCIENT HOUSE OF BLACK
hearing returned to him. Fear jabbed at his insides like needles as he
wondered what was going to happen to him if he was expelled. The
idea was so terrible that he did not dare voice it aloud, not even to
Ron and Hermione, who, though he often saw them whispering together and casting anxious looks in his direction, followed his lead in
not mentioning it. Sometimes he could not prevent his imagination
showing him a faceless Ministry official who was snapping his wand
in two and ordering him back to the Dursleys’ . . . but he would not
go. He was determined on that. He would come back here to Grimmauld Place and live with Sirius.
He felt as though a brick had dropped into his stomach when Mrs.
Weasley turned to him during dinner on Wednesday evening and said
quietly, “I’ve ironed your best clothes for tomorrow morning, Harry,
and I want you to wash your hair tonight too. A good first impression
can work wonders.”
Ron, Hermione, Fred, George, and Ginny all stopped talking and
looked over at him. Harry nodded and tried to keep eating his chops,
but his mouth had become so dry he could not chew.
“How am I getting there?” he asked Mrs. Weasley, trying to sound
unconcerned.
“Arthur’s taking you to work with him,” said Mrs. Weasley gently.
Mr. Weasley smiled encouragingly at Harry across the table.
“You can wait in my office until it’s time for the hearing,” he said.
Harry looked over at Sirius, but before he could ask the question,
Mrs. Weasley had answered it.
“Professor Dumbledore doesn’t think it’s a good idea for Sirius to
go with you, and I must say I —”
“— think he’s quite right,” said Sirius through clenched teeth.
Mrs. Weasley pursed her lips.
“When did Dumbledore tell you that?” Harry said, staring at
Sirius.

“He came last night, when you were in bed,” said Mr. Weasley.
Sirius stabbed moodily at a potato with his fork. Harry dropped his
own eyes to his plate. The thought that Dumbledore had been in the
house on the eve of his hearing and not asked to see him made him
feel, if that were possible, even worse.

H

arry awoke at half-past five the next morning as abruptly and
completely as if somebody had yelled in his ear. For a few
moments he lay immobile as the prospect of the hearing filled every
tiny particle of his brain, then, unable to bear it, he leapt out of bed
and put on his glasses. Mrs. Weasley had laid out his freshly laundered
jeans and T-shirt at the foot of his bed. Harry scrambled into them.
The blank picture on the wall sniggered again.
Ron was lying sprawled on his back with his mouth wide open, fast
asleep. He did not stir as Harry crossed the room, stepped out onto
the landing, and closed the door softly behind him. Trying not to
think of the next time he would see Ron, when they might no longer
be fellow students at Hogwarts, Harry walked quietly down the stairs,
past the heads of Kreacher’s ancestors, and into the kitchen.
He had expected it to be empty, but it was not. When he reached
the door he heard the soft rumble of voices on the other side and
when he pushed it open he saw Mr. and Mrs. Weasley, Sirius, Lupin,
and Tonks sitting there almost as though they were waiting for him.

CHAPTER SEVEN
All were fully dressed except Mrs. Weasley, who was wearing a quilted,
purple dressing gown. She leapt to her feet the moment he entered.
“Breakfast,” she said as she pulled out her wand and hurried over to
the fire.
“M-m-morning, Harry,” yawned Tonks. Her hair was blonde and
curly this morning. “Sleep all right?”
“Yeah,” said Harry.
“I’ve b-b-been up all night,” she said, with another shuddering
yawn. “Come and sit down. . . .”
She drew out a chair, knocking over the one beside it in the process.
“What do you want, Harry?” Mrs. Weasley called. “Porridge?
Muffins? Kippers? Bacon and eggs? Toast?”
“Just — just toast, thanks,” said Harry.
Lupin glanced at Harry, then said to Tonks, “What were you saying
about Scrimgeour?”
“Oh . . . yeah . . . well, we need to be a bit more careful, he’s been
asking Kingsley and me funny questions. . . .”
Harry felt vaguely grateful that he was not required to join in the
conversation. His insides were squirming. Mrs. Weasley placed a couple of pieces of toast and marmalade in front of him; he tried to eat,
but it was like chewing carpet. Mrs. Weasley sat down on his other
side and started fussing with his T-shirt, tucking in the label and
smoothing out creases across the shoulders. He wished she wouldn’t.
“. . . and I’ll have to tell Dumbledore I can’t do night duty tomorrow, I’m just t-t-too tired,” Tonks finished, yawning hugely again.
“I’ll cover for you,” said Mr. Weasley. “I’m okay, I’ve got a report to
finish anyway. . . .”
Mr. Weasley was not wearing wizard’s robes but a pair of pinstriped trousers and an old bomber jacket. He turned from Tonks to
Harry.
“How are you feeling?”


122

THE MINISTRY OF MAGIC
Harry shrugged.
“It’ll all be over soon,” Mr. Weasley said bracingly. “In a few hours’
time you’ll be cleared.”
Harry said nothing.
“The hearing’s on my floor, in Amelia Bones’s office. She’s Head of
the Department of Magical Law Enforcement and she’s the one who’ll
be questioning you.”
“Amelia Bones is okay, Harry,” said Tonks earnestly. “She’s fair,
she’ll hear you out.”
Harry nodded, still unable to think of anything to say.
“Don’t lose your temper,” said Sirius abruptly. “Be polite and stick
to the facts.”
Harry nodded again.
“The law’s on your side,” said Lupin quietly. “Even underage wizards are allowed to use magic in life-threatening situations.”
Something very cold trickled down the back of Harry’s neck; for a
moment he thought someone was putting a Disillusionment Charm
on him again, then he realized that Mrs. Weasley was attacking his
hair with a wet comb. She pressed hard on the top of his head.
“Doesn’t it ever lie flat?” she said desperately.
Harry shook his head.
Mr. Weasley checked his watch and looked up at Harry.
“I think we’ll go now,” he said. “We’re a bit early, but I think you’ll
be better off there than hanging around here.”
“Okay,” said Harry automatically, dropping his toast and getting to
his feet.
“You’ll be all right, Harry,” said Tonks, patting him on the arm.
“Good luck,” said Lupin. “I’m sure it will be fine.”
“And if it’s not,” said Sirius grimly, “I’ll see to Amelia Bones for
you. . . .”
Harry smiled weakly. Mrs. Weasley hugged him.

CHAPTER SEVEN
“We’ve all got our fingers crossed,” she said.
“Right,” said Harry. “Well . . . see you later then.”
He followed Mr. Weasley upstairs and along the hall. He could hear
Sirius’s mother grunting in her sleep behind her curtains. Mr. Weasley
unbolted the door and they stepped out into the cold, gray dawn.
“You don’t normally walk to work, do you?” Harry asked him, as
they set off briskly around the square.
“No, I usually Apparate,” said Mr. Weasley, “but obviously you can’t,
and I think it’s best we arrive in a thoroughly non-magical fashion . . .
makes a better impression, given what you’re being disciplined for. . . .”
Mr. Weasley kept his hand inside his jacket as they walked. Harry
knew it was clenched around his wand. The run-down streets were
almost deserted, but when they arrived at the miserable little Underground station they found it already full of early morning commuters.
As ever when he found himself in close proximity to Muggles going
about their daily business, Mr. Weasley was hard put to contain his
enthusiasm.
“Simply fabulous,” he whispered, indicating the automatic ticket
machines. “Wonderfully ingenious.”
“They’re out of order,” said Harry, pointing at the sign.
“Yes, but even so . . .” said Mr. Weasley, beaming fondly at them.
They bought their tickets instead from a sleepy-looking guard
(Harry handled the transaction, as Mr. Weasley was not very good
with Muggle money) and five minutes later they were boarding an
Underground train that rattled them off toward the center of London.
Mr. Weasley kept anxiously checking and rechecking the Underground map above the windows.
“Four stops, Harry . . . three stops left now . . . two stops to go,
Harry . . .”
They got off at a station in the very heart of London, swept from
the train in a tide of besuited men and women carrying briefcases. Up

the escalator they went, through the ticket barrier (Mr. Weasley
delighted with the way the stile swallowed his ticket), and emerged
onto a broad street lined with imposing-looking buildings, already
full of traffic.
“Where are we?” said Mr. Weasley blankly, and for one heartstopping moment Harry thought they had gotten off at the wrong station despite Mr. Weasley’s continual references to the map; but a
second later he said, “Ah yes . . . this way, Harry,” and led him down
a side road.
“Sorry,” he said, “but I never come by train and it all looks rather
different from a Muggle perspective. As a matter of fact I’ve never
even used the visitor’s entrance before.”
The farther they walked, the smaller and less imposing the buildings became, until finally they reached a street that contained several
rather shabby-looking offices, a pub, and an overflowing dumpster.
Harry had expected a rather more impressive location for the Ministry
of Magic.
“Here we are,” said Mr. Weasley brightly, pointing at an old red
telephone box, which was missing several panes of glass and stood before a heavily graffittied wall. “After you, Harry.”
He opened the telephone box door.
Harry stepped inside, wondering what on earth this was about. Mr.
Weasley folded himself in beside Harry and closed the door. It was a
tight fit; Harry was jammed against the telephone apparatus, which
was hanging crookedly from the wall as though a vandal had tried to
rip it off. Mr. Weasley reached past Harry for the receiver.
“Mr. Weasley, I think this might be out of order too,” Harry said.
“No, no, I’m sure it’s fine,” said Mr. Weasley, holding the receiver
above his head and peering at the dial. “Let’s see . . . six . . .” he dialed
the number, “two . . . four . . . and another four . . . and another
two . . .”


125



CHAPTER SEVEN
As the dial whirred smoothly back into place, a cool female voice
sounded inside the telephone box, not from the receiver in Mr.
Weasley’s hand, but as loudly and plainly as though an invisible
woman were standing right beside them.
“Welcome to the Ministry of Magic. Please state your name and
business.”
“Er . . .” said Mr. Weasley, clearly uncertain whether he should talk
into the receiver or not; he compromised by holding the mouthpiece
to his ear, “Arthur Weasley, Misuse of Muggle Artifacts Office, here
to escort Harry Potter, who has been asked to attend a disciplinary
hearing. . . .”
“Thank you,” said the cool female voice. “Visitor, please take the
badge and attach it to the front of your robes.”
There was a click and a rattle, and Harry saw something slide out
of the metal chute where returned coins usually appeared. He picked
it up: It was a square silver badge with Harry Potter, Disciplinary Hearing on it. He pinned it to the front of his T-shirt as the female voice
spoke again.
“Visitor to the Ministry, you are required to submit to a search and
present your wand for registration at the security desk, which is located at the far end of the Atrium.”
The floor of the telephone box shuddered. They were sinking
slowly into the ground. Harry watched apprehensively as the pavement rose up past the glass windows of the telephone box until darkness closed over their heads. Then he could see nothing at all; he could
only hear a dull grinding noise as the telephone box made its way
down through the earth. After about a minute, though it felt much
longer to Harry, a chink of golden light illuminated his feet and,
widening, rose up his body, until it hit him in the face and he had to
blink to stop his eyes from watering.
“The Ministry of Magic wishes you a pleasant day,” said the
woman’s voice.


126



THE MINISTRY OF MAGIC
The door of the telephone box sprang open and Mr. Weasley
stepped out of it, followed by Harry, whose mouth had fallen open.
They were standing at one end of a very long and splendid hall with a
highly polished, dark wood floor. The peacock-blue ceiling was inlaid
with gleaming golden symbols that were continually moving and changing like some enormous heavenly notice board. The walls on each side
were paneled in shiny dark wood and had many gilded fireplaces set into
them. Every few seconds a witch or wizard would emerge from one of
the left-hand fireplaces with a soft whoosh; on the right-hand side, short
queues of wizards were forming before each fireplace, waiting to depart.
Halfway down the hall was a fountain. A group of golden statues,
larger than life-size, stood in the middle of a circular pool. Tallest of
them all was a noble-looking wizard with his wand pointing straight
up in the air. Grouped around him were a beautiful witch, a centaur,
a goblin, and a house-elf. The last three were all looking adoringly up
at the witch and wizard. Glittering jets of water were flying from the
ends of the two wands, the point of the centaur’s arrow, the tip of
the goblin’s hat, and each of the house-elf ’s ears, so that the tinkling
hiss of falling water was added to the pops and cracks of Apparators
and the clatter of footsteps as hundreds of witches and wizards, most
of whom were wearing glum, early-morning looks, strode toward a set
of golden gates at the far end of the hall.
“This way,” said Mr. Weasley.
They joined the throng, wending their way between the Ministry
workers, some of whom were carrying tottering piles of parchment,
others battered briefcases, still others reading the Daily Prophet as they
walked. As they passed the fountain Harry saw silver Sickles and
bronze Knuts glinting up at him from the bottom of the pool. A
small, smudged sign beside it read:

All proceeds from the Fountain of Magical Brethren will be given to
St. Mungo’s Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries

CHAPTER SEVEN
If I’m not expelled from Hogwarts, I’ll put in ten Galleons, Harry
found himself thinking desperately.
“Over here, Harry,” said Mr. Weasley, and they stepped out of the
stream of Ministry employees heading for the golden gates, toward a
desk on the left, over which hung a sign saying security. A badly
shaven wizard in peacock-blue robes looked up as they approached
and put down his Daily Prophet.
“I’m escorting a visitor,” said Mr. Weasley, gesturing toward Harry.
“Step over here,” said the wizard in a bored voice.
Harry walked closer to him and the wizard held up a long golden
rod, thin and flexible as a car aerial, and passed it up and down Harry’s
front and back.
“Wand,” grunted the security wizard at Harry, putting down the
golden instrument and holding out his hand.
Harry produced his wand. The wizard dropped it onto a strange
brass instrument, which looked something like a set of scales with
only one dish. It began to vibrate. A narrow strip of parchment came
speeding out of a slit in the base. The wizard tore this off and read the
writing upon it.
“Eleven inches, phoenix-feather core, been in use four years. That
correct?”
“Yes,” said Harry nervously.
“I keep this,” said the wizard, impaling the slip of parchment on a
small brass spike. “You get this back,” he added, thrusting the wand at
Harry.
“Thank you.”
“Hang on. . . .” said the wizard slowly.
His eyes had darted from the silver visitor’s badge on Harry’s chest
to his forehead.
“Thank you, Eric,” said Mr. Weasley firmly, and grasping Harry by
the shoulder, he steered him away from the desk and back into the
stream of wizards and witches walking through the golden gates.


THE MINISTRY OF MAGIC
Jostled slightly by the crowd, Harry followed Mr. Weasley through
the gates into the smaller hall beyond, where at least twenty lifts stood
behind wrought golden grilles. Harry and Mr. Weasley joined the
crowd around one of them. A big, bearded wizard holding a large
cardboard box stood nearby. The box was emitting rasping noises.
“All right, Arthur?” said the wizard, nodding at Mr. Weasley.
“What’ve you got there, Bob?” asked Mr. Weasley, looking at the
box.
“We’re not sure,” said the wizard seriously. “We thought it was a
bog-standard chicken until it started breathing fire. Looks like a serious breach of the Ban on Experimental Breeding to me.”
With a great jangling and clattering a lift descended in front of
them; the golden grille slid back and Harry and Mr. Weasley moved inside it with the rest of the crowd. Harry found himself jammed against
the back wall of the lift. Several witches and wizards were looking at
him curiously; he stared at his feet to avoid catching anyone’s eye, flattening his fringe as he did so. The grilles slid shut with a crash and the
lift ascended slowly, chains rattling all the while, while the same cool
female voice Harry had heard in the telephone box rang out again.
“Level seven, Department of Magical Games and Sports, incorporating the British and Irish Quidditch League Headquarters, Official
Gobstones Club, and Ludicrous Patents Office.”
The lift doors opened; Harry glimpsed an untidy-looking corridor,
with various posters of Quidditch teams tacked lopsidedly on the
walls; one of the wizards in the lift, who was carrying an armful of
broomsticks, extricated himself with difficulty and disappeared down
the corridor. The doors closed, the lift juddered upward again, and the
woman’s voice said, “Level six, Department of Magical Transport, incorporating the Floo Network Authority, Broom Regulatory Control,
Portkey Office, and Apparation Test Center.”
Once again the lift doors opened and four or five witches and
wizards got out; at the same time, several paper airplanes swooped


129



CHAPTER SEVEN
into the lift. Harry stared up at them as they flapped idly around
above his head; they were a pale violet color and he could see ministry
of magic stamped along the edges of their wings.
“Just Interdepartmental memos,” Mr. Weasley muttered to him.
“We used to use owls, but the mess was unbelievable . . . droppings all
over the desks . . .”
As they clattered upward again, the memos flapped around the
swaying lamp in the lift’s ceiling.
“Level five, Department of International Magical Cooperation, incorporating the International Magical Trading Standards Body, the
International Magical Office of Law, and the International Confederation of Wizards, British Seats.”
When the doors opened, two of the memos zoomed out with a few
more witches and wizards, but several more memos zoomed in, so that
the light from the lamp in the ceiling flickered and flashed as they
darted around it.
“Level four, Department for the Regulation and Control of
Magical Creatures, incorporating Beast, Being, and Spirit Divisions,
Goblin Liaison Office, and Pest Advisory Bureau.”
“ ’S’cuse,” said the wizard carrying the fire-breathing chicken and
he left the lift pursued by a little flock of memos. The doors clanged
shut yet again.
“Level three, Department of Magical Accidents and Catastrophes,
including the Accidental Magic Reversal Squad, Obliviator Headquarters, and Muggle-Worthy Excuse Committee.”
Everybody left the lift on this floor except Mr. Weasley, Harry, and
a witch who was reading an extremely long piece of parchment that
was trailing on the ground. The remaining memos continued to soar
around the lamp as the lift juddered upward again, and then the doors
opened and the voice said, “Level two, Department of Magical Law
Enforcement, including the Improper Use of Magic Office, Auror
Headquarters, and Wizengamot Administration Services.”

“This is us, Harry,” said Mr. Weasley, and they followed the witch
out of the lift into a corridor lined with doors. “My office is on the
other side of the floor.”
“Mr. Weasley,” said Harry, as they passed a window through which
sunlight was streaming, “aren’t we underground?”
“Yes, we are,” said Mr. Weasley, “those are enchanted windows;
Magical Maintenance decide what weather we’re getting every day.
We had two months of hurricanes last time they were angling for a
pay raise. . . . Just round here, Harry.”
They turned a corner, walked through a pair of heavy oak doors,
and emerged in a cluttered, open area divided into cubicles, which
were buzzing with talk and laughter. Memos were zooming in and out
of cubicles like miniature rockets. A lopsided sign on the nearest cubicle read auror headquarters.
Harry looked surreptitiously through the doorways as they passed.
The Aurors had covered their cubicle walls with everything from pictures of wanted wizards and photographs of their families, to posters
of their favorite Quidditch teams and articles from the Daily Prophet.
A scarlet-robed man with a ponytail longer than Bill’s was sitting with
his boots up on his desk, dictating a report to his quill. A little farther
along, a witch with a patch over her eye was talking over the top of her
cubicle wall to Kingsley Shacklebolt.
“Morning, Weasley,” said Kingsley carelessly, as they drew nearer.
“I’ve been wanting a word with you, have you got a second?”
“Yes, if it really is a second,” said Mr. Weasley, “I’m in rather a
hurry.”
They were talking to each other as though they hardly knew each
other, and when Harry opened his mouth to say hello to Kingsley, Mr.
Weasley stood on his foot. They followed Kingsley along the row and
into the very last cubicle.
Harry received a slight shock; Sirius’s face was blinking down at
him from every direction. Newspaper cuttings and old photographs


131



CHAPTER SEVEN
— even the one of Sirius being best man at the Potters’ wedding —
papered the walls. The only Sirius-free space was a map of the world
in which little red pins were glowing like jewels.
“Here,” said Kingsley brusquely to Mr. Weasley, shoving a sheaf of
parchment into his hand, “I need as much information as possible on
flying Muggle vehicles sighted in the last twelve months. We’ve received information that Black might still be using his old motorcycle.”
Kingsley tipped Harry an enormous wink and added, in a whisper,
“Give him the magazine, he might find it interesting.” Then he said in
normal tones, “And don’t take too long, Weasley, the delay on that
firelegs report held our investigation up for a month.”
“If you had read my report you would know that the term is
‘firearms,’ ” said Mr. Weasley coolly. “And I’m afraid you’ll have to wait
for information on motorcycles, we’re extremely busy at the moment.” He dropped his voice and said, “If you can get away before
seven, Molly’s making meatballs.”
He beckoned to Harry and led him out of Kingsley’s cubicle,
through a second set of oak doors, into another passage, turned left,
marched along another corridor, turned right into a dimly lit and distinctly shabby corridor, and finally reached a dead end, where a door
on the left stood ajar, revealing a broom cupboard, and a door on the
right bore a tarnished brass plaque reading misuse of muggle
artifacts.
Mr. Weasley’s dingy office seemed to be slightly smaller than the
broom cupboard. Two desks had been crammed inside it and there was
barely room to move around them because of all the overflowing filing
cabinets lining the walls, on top of which were tottering piles of files.
The little wall space available bore witness to Mr. Weasley’s obsessions;
there were several posters of cars, including one of a dismantled engine,
two illustrations of postboxes he seemed to have cut out of Muggle
children’s books, and a diagram showing how to wire a plug.
Sitting on top of Mr. Weasley’s overflowing in-tray was an old

toaster that was hiccuping in a disconsolate way and a pair of empty
leather gloves that were twiddling their thumbs. A photograph of the
Weasley family stood beside the in-tray. Harry noticed that Percy appeared to have walked out of it.
“We haven’t got a window,” said Mr. Weasley apologetically, taking
off his bomber jacket and placing it on the back of his chair. “We’ve
asked, but they don’t seem to think we need one. Have a seat, Harry,
doesn’t look as if Perkins is in yet.”
Harry squeezed himself into the chair behind Perkins’s desk while
Mr. Weasley rifled through the sheaf of parchment Kingsley Shacklebolt had given him.
“Ah,” he said, grinning, as he extracted a copy of a magazine entitled The Quibbler from its midst, “yes . . .” He flicked through it.
“Yes, he’s right, I’m sure Sirius will find that very amusing — oh dear,
what’s this now?”
A memo had just zoomed in through the open door and fluttered
to rest on top of the hiccuping toaster. Mr. Weasley unfolded it and
read aloud, “ ‘Third regurgitating public toilet reported in Bethnal
Green, kindly investigate immediately.’ This is getting ridiculous. . . .”
“A regurgitating toilet?”
“Anti-Muggle pranksters,” said Mr. Weasley, frowning. “We had
two last week, one in Wimbledon, one in Elephant and Castle. Muggles are pulling the flush and instead of everything disappearing —
well, you can imagine. The poor things keep calling in those — those
pumbles, I think they’re called — you know, the ones who mend pipes
and things —”
“Plumbers?”
“— exactly, yes, but of course they’re flummoxed. I only hope we
can catch whoever’s doing it.”
“Will it be Aurors who catch them?”
“Oh no, this is too trivial for Aurors, it’ll be the ordinary Magical
Law Enforcement Patrol — ah, Harry, this is Perkins.”

CHAPTER SEVEN
A stooped, timid-looking old wizard with fluffy white hair had just
entered the room, panting.
“Oh Arthur!” he said desperately, without looking at Harry.
“Thank goodness, I didn’t know what to do for the best, whether to
wait here for you or not, I’ve just sent an owl to your home but you’ve
obviously missed it — an urgent message came ten minutes ago —”
“I know about the regurgitating toilet,” said Mr. Weasley.
“No, no, it’s not the toilet, it’s the Potter boy’s hearing — they’ve
changed the time and venue — it starts at eight o’clock now and it’s
down in old Courtroom Ten —”
“Down in old — but they told me — Merlin’s beard —”
Mr. Weasley looked at his watch, let out a yelp, and leapt from his
chair.
“Quick, Harry, we should have been there five minutes ago!”
Perkins flattened himself against the filing cabinets as Mr. Weasley
left the office at a run, Harry on his heels.
“Why have they changed the time?” Harry said breathlessly as they
hurtled past the Auror cubicles; people poked out their heads and
stared as they streaked past. Harry felt as though he had left all his insides back at Perkins’s desk.
“I’ve no idea, but thank goodness we got here so early, if you’d
missed it it would have been catastrophic!”
Mr. Weasley skidded to a halt beside the lifts and jabbed impatiently at the down button.
“Come ON!”
The lift clattered into view and they hurried inside. Every time it
stopped Mr. Weasley cursed furiously and pummelled the number
nine button.
“Those courtrooms haven’t been used in years,” said Mr. Weasley
angrily. “I can’t think why they’re doing it down there — unless —
but no . . .”

A plump witch carrying a smoking goblet entered the lift at that
moment, and Mr. Weasley did not elaborate.
“The Atrium,” said the cool female voice and the golden grilles slid
open, showing Harry a distant glimpse of the golden statues in the
fountain. The plump witch got out and a sallow-skinned wizard with
a very mournful face got in.
“Morning, Arthur,” he said in a sepulchral voice as the lift began to
descend. “Don’t often see you down here. . . .”
“Urgent business, Bode,” said Mr. Weasley, who was bouncing on
the balls of his feet and throwing anxious looks over at Harry.
“Ah, yes,” said Bode, surveying Harry unblinkingly. “Of course.”
Harry barely had emotion to spare for Bode, but his unfaltering
gaze did not make him feel any more comfortable.
“Department of Mysteries,” said the cool female voice, and left it at
that.
“Quick, Harry,” said Mr. Weasley as the lift doors rattled open, and
they sped up a corridor that was quite different from those above. The
walls were bare; there were no windows and no doors apart from a
plain black one set at the very end of the corridor. Harry expected
them to go through it, but instead Mr. Weasley seized him by the arm
and dragged him to the left, where there was an opening leading to a
flight of steps.
“Down here, down here,” panted Mr. Weasley, taking two steps at
a time. “The lift doesn’t even come down this far . . . why they’re doing it there . . .”
They reached the bottom of the steps and ran along yet another
corridor, which bore a great resemblance to that which led to Snape’s
dungeon at Hogwarts, with rough stone walls and torches in brackets.
The doors they passed here were heavy wooden ones with iron bolts
and keyholes.
“Courtroom . . . ten . . . I think . . . we’re nearly . . . yes.”

Mr. Weasley stumbled to a halt outside a grimy dark door with an

in his chest.

“Aren’t — aren’t you coming with — ?”
“No, no, I’m not allowed. Good luck!”

He swallowed hard, turned the heavy iron door handle, and stepped
inside the courtroom.

H

arry gasped; he could not help himself. The large dungeon he
had entered was horribly familiar. He had not only seen it
before, he had been here before: This was the place he had visited inside Dumbledore’s Pensieve, the place where he had watched the
Lestranges sentenced to life imprisonment in Azkaban.
The walls were made of dark stone, dimly lit by torches. Empty
benches rose on either side of him, but ahead, in the highest benches
of all, were many shadowy figures. They had been talking in low
voices, but as the heavy door swung closed behind Harry an ominous
silence fell.
A cold male voice rang across the courtroom.
“You’re late.”
“Sorry,” said Harry nervously. “I-I didn’t know the time had
changed.”
“That is not the Wizengamot’s fault,” said the voice. “An owl was
sent to you this morning. Take your seat.”
Harry dropped his gaze to the chair in the center of the room, the
arms of which were covered in chains. He had seen those chains spring


137

CHAPTER EIGHT
to life and bind whoever sat between them. His footsteps echoed
loudly as he walked across the stone floor. When he sat gingerly on the
edge of the chair the chains clinked rather threateningly but did not
bind him. Feeling rather sick he looked up at the people seated at the
bench above.
There were about fifty of them, all, as far as he could see, wearing
plum-colored robes with an elaborately worked silver W on the lefthand side of the chest and all staring down their noses at him, some
with very austere expressions, others looks of frank curiosity.
In the very middle of the front row sat Cornelius Fudge, the Minister of Magic. Fudge was a portly man who often sported a lime-green
bowler hat, though today he had dispensed with it; he had dispensed
too with the indulgent smile he had once worn when he spoke to
Harry. A broad, square-jawed witch with very short gray hair sat on
Fudge’s left; she wore a monocle and looked forbidding. On Fudge’s
right was another witch, but she was sitting so far back on the bench
that her face was in shadow.
“Very well,” said Fudge. “The accused being present — finally —
let us begin. Are you ready?” he called down the row.
“Yes, sir,” said an eager voice Harry knew. Ron’s brother Percy was
sitting at the very end of the front bench. Harry looked at Percy, expecting some sign of recognition from him, but none came. Percy’s
eyes, behind his horn-rimmed glasses, were fixed on his parchment, a
quill poised in his hand.
“Disciplinary hearing of the twelfth of August,” said Fudge in a
ringing voice, and Percy began taking notes at once, “into offenses
committed under the Decree for the Reasonable Restriction of Underage Sorcery and the International Statute of Secrecy by Harry
James Potter, resident at number four, Privet Drive, Little Whinging,
Surrey.
“Interrogators: Cornelius Oswald Fudge, Minister of Magic;

Minister. Court Scribe, Percy Ignatius Weasley —”
“— Witness for the defense, Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore,” said a quiet voice from behind Harry, who turned his head so
fast he cricked his neck.
Dumbledore was striding serenely across the room wearing long
midnight-blue robes and a perfectly calm expression. His long silver
beard and hair gleamed in the torchlight as he drew level with Harry
and looked up at Fudge through the half-moon spectacles that rested
halfway down his very crooked nose.
The members of the Wizengamot were muttering. All eyes were
now on Dumbledore. Some looked annoyed, others slightly frightened; two elderly witches in the back row, however, raised their hands
and waved in welcome.
A powerful emotion had risen in Harry’s chest at the sight of Dumbledore, a fortified, hopeful feeling rather like that which phoenix
song gave him. He wanted to catch Dumbledore’s eye, but Dumbledore was not looking his way; he was continuing to look up at the
obviously flustered Fudge.
“Ah,” said Fudge, who looked thoroughly disconcerted. “Dumbledore. Yes. You — er — got our — er — message that the time and —
er — place of the hearing had been changed, then?”
“I must have missed it,” said Dumbledore cheerfully. “However,
due to a lucky mistake I arrived at the Ministry three hours early, so
no harm done.”
“Yes — well — I suppose we’ll need another chair — I —
Weasley, could you — ?”
“Not to worry, not to worry,” said Dumbledore pleasantly; he took
out his wand, gave it a little flick, and a squashy chintz armchair appeared out of nowhere next to Harry. Dumbledore sat down, put the
tips of his long fingers together, and looked at Fudge over them with
an expression of polite interest. The Wizengamot was still muttering


139

CHAPTER EIGHT
and fidgeting restlessly; only when Fudge spoke again did they settle
down.
“Yes,” said Fudge again, shuffling his notes. “Well, then. So. The
charges. Yes.”
He extricated a piece of parchment from the pile before him, took
a deep breath, and read, “The charges against the accused are as follows: That he did knowingly, deliberately, and in full awareness of the
illegality of his actions, having received a previous written warning
from the Ministry of Magic on a similar charge, produce a Patronus
Charm in a Muggle-inhabited area, in the presence of a Muggle, on
August the second at twenty-three minutes past nine, which constitutes an offense under paragraph C of the Decree for the Reasonable
Restriction of Underage Sorcery, 1875, and also under section thirteen of the International Confederation of Wizards’ Statute of Secrecy.
“You are Harry James Potter, of number four, Privet Drive, Little
Whinging, Surrey?” Fudge said, glaring at Harry over the top of his
parchment.
“Yes,” Harry said.
“You received an official warning from the Ministry for using illegal magic three years ago, did you not?”
“Yes, but —”
“And yet you conjured a Patronus on the night of the second of
August?” said Fudge.
“Yes,” said Harry, “but —”
“Knowing that you are not permitted to use magic outside school
while you are under the age of seventeen?”
“Yes, but —”
“Knowing that you were in an area full of Muggles?”
“Yes, but —”
“Fully aware that you were in close proximity to a Muggle at the
time?
“Yes,” said Harry angrily, “but I only used it because we were —”


THE HEARING
The witch with the monocle on Fudge’s left cut across him in a
booming voice.
“You produced a fully fledged Patronus?”
“Yes,” said Harry, “because —”
“A corporeal Patronus?”
“A — what?” said Harry.
“Your Patronus had a clearly defined form? I mean to say, it was
more than vapor or smoke?”
“Yes,” said Harry, feeling both impatient and slightly desperate,
“it’s a stag, it’s always a stag.”
“Always?” boomed Madam Bones. “You have produced a Patronus
before now?”
“Yes,” said Harry, “I’ve been doing it for over a year —”
“And you are fifteen years old?”
“Yes, and —”
“You learned this at school?”
“Yes, Professor Lupin taught me in my third year, because of the —”
“Impressive,” said Madam Bones, staring down at him, “a true
Patronus at that age . . . very impressive indeed.”
Some of the wizards and witches around her were muttering again;
a few nodded, but others were frowning and shaking their heads.
“It’s not a question of how impressive the magic was,” said Fudge
in a testy voice. “In fact, the more impressive the worse it is, I would
have thought, given that the boy did it in plain view of a Muggle!”
Those who had been frowning now murmured in agreement, but
it was the sight of Percy’s sanctimonious little nod that goaded Harry
into speech.
“I did it because of the dementors!” he said loudly, before anyone
could interrupt him again.
He had expected more muttering, but the silence that fell seemed
to be somehow denser than before.
“Dementors?” said Madam Bones after a moment, raising her thick


141



CHAPTER EIGHT
eyebrows so that her monocle looked in danger of falling out. “What
do you mean, boy?”
“I mean there were two dementors down that alleyway and they
went for me and my cousin!”
“Ah,” said Fudge again, smirking unpleasantly as he looked around
at the Wizengamot, as though inviting them to share the joke. “Yes.
Yes, I thought we’d be hearing something like this.”
“Dementors in Little Whinging?” Madam Bones said in tones of
great surprise. “I don’t understand —”
“Don’t you, Amelia?” said Fudge, still smirking. “Let me explain.
He’s been thinking it through and decided dementors would make a
very nice little cover story, very nice indeed. Muggles can’t see dementors, can they, boy? Highly convenient, highly convenient . . . so it’s
just your word and no witnesses. . . .”
“I’m not lying!” said Harry loudly, over another outbreak of muttering from the court. “There were two of them, coming from opposite ends of the alley, everything went dark and cold and my cousin
felt them and ran for it —”
“Enough, enough!” said Fudge with a very supercilious look on his
face. “I’m sorry to interrupt what I’m sure would have been a very
well-rehearsed story —”
Dumbledore cleared his throat. The Wizengamot fell silent again.
“We do, in fact, have a witness to the presence of dementors in that
alleyway,” he said, “other than Dudley Dursley, I mean.”
Fudge’s plump face seemed to slacken, as though somebody had let
air out of it. He stared down at Dumbledore for a moment or two,
then, with the appearance of a man pulling himself back together,
said, “We haven’t got time to listen to more taradiddles, I’m afraid,
Dumbledore. I want this dealt with quickly —”
“I may be wrong,” said Dumbledore pleasantly, “but I am sure that
under the Wizengamot Charter of Rights, the accused has the right to

THE HEARING
present witnesses for his or her case? Isn’t that the policy of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement, Madam Bones?” he continued, addressing the witch in the monocle.
“True,” said Madam Bones. “Perfectly true.”
“Oh, very well, very well,” snapped Fudge. “Where is this person?”
“I brought her with me,” said Dumbledore. “She’s just outside the
door. Should I — ?”
“No — Weasley, you go,” Fudge barked at Percy, who got up at
once, hurried down the stone steps from the judge’s balcony, and hastened past Dumbledore and Harry without glancing at them.
A moment later, Percy returned, followed by Mrs. Figg. She looked
scared and more batty than ever. Harry wished she had thought to
change out of her carpet slippers.
Dumbledore stood up and gave Mrs. Figg his chair, conjuring a
second one for himself.
“Full name?” said Fudge loudly, when Mrs. Figg had perched herself nervously on the very edge of her seat.
“Arabella Doreen Figg,” said Mrs. Figg in her quavery voice.
“And who exactly are you?” said Fudge, in a bored and lofty voice.
“I’m a resident of Little Whinging, close to where Harry Potter
lives,” said Mrs. Figg.
“We have no record of any witch or wizard living in Little Whinging other than Harry Potter,” said Madam Bones at once. “That situation has always been closely monitored, given . . . given past events.”
“I’m a Squib,” said Mrs. Figg. “So you wouldn’t have me registered,
would you?”
“A Squib, eh?” said Fudge, eyeing her suspiciously. “We’ll be checking that. You’ll leave details of your parentage with my assistant,
Weasley. Incidentally, can Squibs see dementors?” he added, looking
left and right along the bench where he sat.
“Yes, we can!” said Mrs. Figg indignantly.


CHAPTER EIGHT
Fudge looked back down at her, his eyebrows raised. “Very well,”
he said coolly. “What is your story?”
“I had gone out to buy cat food from the corner shop at the end of
Wisteria Walk, shortly after nine on the evening of the second of
August,” gabbled Mrs. Figg at once, as though she had learned what
she was saying by heart, “when I heard a disturbance down the alleyway between Magnolia Crescent and Wisteria Walk. On approaching
the mouth of the alleyway I saw dementors running —”
“Running?” said Madam Bones sharply. “Dementors don’t run,
they glide.”
“That’s what I meant to say,” said Mrs. Figg quickly, patches of
pink appearing in her withered cheeks. “Gliding along the alley toward what looked like two boys.”
“What did they look like?” said Madam Bones, narrowing her eyes
so that the monocle’s edges disappeared into her flesh.
“Well, one was very large and the other one rather skinny —”
“No, no,” said Madam Bones impatiently, “the dementors . . . describe them.”
“Oh,” said Mrs. Figg, the pink flush creeping up her neck now.
“They were big. Big and wearing cloaks.”
Harry felt a horrible sinking in the pit of his stomach. Whatever
Mrs. Figg said to the contrary, it sounded to him as though the most
she had ever seen was a picture of a dementor, and a picture could
never convey the truth of what these beings were like: the eerie way
they moved, hovering inches over the ground, or the rotting smell of
them, or that terrible, rattling noise they made as they sucked on the
surrounding air . . . A dumpy wizard with a large black mustache in
the second row leaned close to his neighbor, a frizzy-haired witch, and
whispered something in her ear. She smirked and nodded.
“Big and wearing cloaks,” repeated Madam Bones coolly, while
Fudge snorted derisively. “I see. Anything else?”


144

THE HEARING
“Yes,” said Mrs. Figg. “I felt them. Everything went cold, and this
was a very warm summer’s night, mark you. And I felt . . . as though
all happiness had gone from the world . . . and I remembered . . .
dreadful things. . . .”
Her voice shook and died.
Madam Bones’ eyes widened slightly. Harry could see red marks
under her eyebrow where the monocle had dug into it.
“What did the dementors do?” she asked, and Harry felt a rush of
hope.
“They went for the boys,” said Mrs. Figg, her voice stronger and
more confident now, the pink flush ebbing away from her face. “One
of them had fallen. The other was backing away, trying to repel the
dementor. That was Harry. He tried twice and produced silver vapor.
On the third attempt, he produced a Patronus, which charged down
the first dementor and then, with his encouragement, chased away the
second from his cousin. And that . . . that was what happened,” Mrs.
Figg finished, somewhat lamely.
Madam Bones looked down at Mrs. Figg in silence; Fudge was not
looking at her at all, but fidgeting with his papers. Finally he raised his
eyes and said, rather aggressively “That’s what you saw, is it?”
“That was what happened,” Mrs. Figg repeated.
“Very well,” said Fudge. “You may go.”
Mrs. Figg cast a frightened look from Fudge to Dumbledore, then
got up and shuffled off toward the door again. Harry heard it thud
shut behind her.
“Not a very convincing witness,” said Fudge loftily.
“Oh, I don’t know,” said Madam Bones in her booming voice. “She
certainly described the effects of a dementor attack very accurately.
And I can’t imagine why she would say they were there if they
weren’t —”
“But dementors wandering into a Muggle suburb and just happening


145



CHAPTER EIGHT
to come across a wizard?” snorted Fudge. “The odds on that must be
very, very long, even Bagman wouldn’t have bet —”
“Oh, I don’t think any of us believe the dementors were there by
coincidence,” said Dumbledore lightly.
The witch sitting to the right of Fudge with her face in shadow
moved slightly, but everyone else was quite still and silent.
“And what is that supposed to mean?” asked Fudge icily.
“It means that I think they were ordered there,” said Dumbledore.
“I think we might have a record of it if someone had ordered a pair
of dementors to go strolling through Little Whinging!” barked Fudge.
“Not if the dementors are taking orders from someone other than
the Ministry of Magic these days,” said Dumbledore calmly. “I have
already given you my views on this matter, Cornelius.”
“Yes, you have,” said Fudge forcefully, “and I have no reason to believe that your views are anything other than bilge, Dumbledore. The
dementors remain in place in Azkaban and are doing everything we
ask them to.”
“Then,” said Dumbledore, quietly but clearly, “we must ask ourselves why somebody within the Ministry ordered a pair of dementors
into that alleyway on the second of August.”
In the complete silence that greeted these words, the witch to the
right of Fudge leaned forward so that Harry saw her for the first time.
He thought she looked just like a large, pale toad. She was rather
squat with a broad, flabby face, as little neck as Uncle Vernon, and a
very wide, slack mouth. Her eyes were large, round, and slightly
bulging. Even the little black velvet bow perched on top of her short
curly hair put him in mind of a large fly she was about to catch on a
long sticky tongue.
“The Chair recognizes Dolores Jane Umbridge, Senior Undersecretary to the Minister,” said Fudge.
The witch spoke in a fluttery, girlish, high-pitched voice that took
Harry aback; he had been expecting a croak.


146



THE HEARING
“I’m sure I must have misunderstood you, Professor Dumbledore,”
she said with a simper that left her big, round eyes as cold as ever. “So
silly of me. But it sounded for a teensy moment as though you were suggesting that the Ministry of Magic had ordered an attack on this boy!”
She gave a silvery laugh that made the hairs on the back of Harry’s
neck stand up. A few other members of the Wizengamot laughed with
her. It could not have been plainer that not one of them was really
amused.
“If it is true that the dementors are taking orders only from the Ministry of Magic, and it is also true that two dementors attacked Harry
and his cousin a week ago, then it follows logically that somebody at
the Ministry might have ordered the attacks,” said Dumbledore politely. “Of course, these particular dementors may have been outside
Ministry control —”
“There are no dementors outside Ministry control!” snapped
Fudge, who had turned brick red.
Dumbledore inclined his head in a little bow.
“Then undoubtedly the Ministry will be making a full inquiry into
why two dementors were so very far from Azkaban and why they attacked without authorization.”
“It is not for you to decide what the Ministry of Magic does or does
not do, Dumbledore!” snapped Fudge, now a shade of magenta of
which Uncle Vernon would have been proud.
“Of course it isn’t,” said Dumbledore mildly. “I was merely expressing my confidence that this matter will not go uninvestigated.”
He glanced at Madam Bones, who readjusted her monocle and
stared back at him, frowning slightly.
“I would remind everybody that the behavior of these dementors,
if indeed they are not figments of this boy’s imagination, is not the
subject of this hearing!” said Fudge. “We are here to examine Harry
Potter’s offenses under the Decree for the Reasonable Restriction of
Underage Sorcery!”


147

CHAPTER EIGHT
“Of course we are,” said Dumbledore, “but the presence of dementors in that alleyway is highly relevant. Clause seven of the Decree
states that magic may be used before Muggles in exceptional circumstances, and as those exceptional circumstances include situations that
threaten the life of the wizard or witch himself, or witches, wizards, or
Muggles present at the time of the —”
“We are familiar with clause seven, thank you very much!” snarled
Fudge.
“Of course you are,” said Dumbledore courteously. “Then we are
in agreement that Harry’s use of the Patronus Charm in these circumstances falls precisely into the category of exceptional circumstances it
describes?”
“If there were dementors, which I doubt —”
“You have heard from an eyewitness,” Dumbledore interrupted. “If
you still doubt her truthfulness, call her back, question her again. I am
sure she would not object.”
“I — that — not —” blustered Fudge, fiddling with the papers before him. “It’s — I want this over with today, Dumbledore!”
“But naturally, you would not care how many times you heard
from a witness, if the alternative was a serious miscarriage of justice,”
said Dumbledore.
“Serious miscarriage, my hat!” said Fudge at the top of his voice.
“Have you ever bothered to tot up the number of cock-and-bull stories this boy has come out with, Dumbledore, while trying to cover up
his flagrant misuse of magic out of school? I suppose you’ve forgotten
the Hover Charm he used three years ago —”
“That wasn’t me, it was a house-elf!” said Harry.
“YOU SEE?” roared Fudge, gesturing flamboyantly in Harry’s direction. “A house-elf! In a Muggle house! I ask you —”
“The house-elf in question is currently in the employ of Hogwarts
School,” said Dumbledore. “I can summon him here in an instant to
give evidence if you wish.”


THE HEARING
“I — not — I haven’t got time to listen to house-elves! Anyway,
that’s not the only — he blew up his aunt, for God’s sake!” Fudge
shouted, banging his fist on the judge’s bench and upsetting a bottle
of ink.
“And you very kindly did not press charges on that occasion, accepting, I presume, that even the best wizards cannot always control
their emotions,” said Dumbledore calmly, as Fudge attempted to
scrub the ink off his notes.
“And I haven’t even started on what he gets up to at school —”
“— but as the Ministry has no authority to punish Hogwarts
students for misdemeanors at school, Harry’s behavior there is not relevant to this inquiry,” said Dumbledore, politely as ever, but now
with a suggestion of coolness behind his words.
“Oho!” said Fudge. “Not our business what he does at school, eh?
You think so?”
“The Ministry does not have the power to expel Hogwarts students, Cornelius, as I reminded you on the night of the second of
August,” said Dumbledore. “Nor does it have the right to confiscate
wands until charges have been successfully proven, again, as I reminded you on the night of the second of August. In your admirable
haste to ensure that the law is upheld, you appear, inadvertently I am
sure, to have overlooked a few laws yourself.”
“Laws can be changed,” said Fudge savagely.
“Of course they can,” said Dumbledore, inclining his head. “And
you certainly seem to be making many changes, Cornelius. Why, in
the few short weeks since I was asked to leave the Wizengamot, it has
already become the practice to hold a full criminal trial to deal with a
simple matter of underage magic!”
A few of the wizards above them shifted uncomfortably in their
seats. Fudge turned a slightly deeper shade of puce. The toadlike
witch on his right, however, merely gazed at Dumbledore, her face
quite expressionless.


149



CHAPTER EIGHT
“As far as I am aware, however,” Dumbledore continued, “there is
no law yet in place that says this court’s job is to punish Harry for
every bit of magic he has ever performed. He has been charged with a
specific offense and he has presented his defense. All he and I can do
now is to await your verdict.”
Dumbledore put his fingertips together again and said no more.
Fudge glared at him, evidently incensed. Harry glanced sideways at
Dumbledore, seeking reassurance; he was not at all sure that Dumbledore was right in telling the Wizengamot, in effect, that it was about
time they made a decision. Again, however, Dumbledore seemed
oblivious to Harry’s attempt to catch his eye. He continued to look up
at the benches where the entire Wizengamot had fallen into urgent,
whispered conversations.
Harry looked at his feet. His heart, which seemed to have swollen
to an unnatural size, was thumping loudly under his ribs. He had expected the hearing to last longer than this. He was not at all sure that
he had made a good impression. He had not really said very much. He
ought to have explained more fully about the dementors, about how
he had fallen over, about how both he and Dudley had nearly been
kissed. . . .
Twice he looked up at Fudge and opened his mouth to speak, but
his swollen heart was now constricting his air passages and both times
he merely took a deep breath and looked back at his shoes.
Then the whispering stopped. Harry wanted to look up at the
judges, but found that it was really much, much easier to keep examining his laces.
“Those in favor of clearing the accused of all charges?” said Madam
Bones’s booming voice.
Harry’s head jerked upward. There were hands in the air, many of
them . . . more than half ! Breathing very fast, he tried to count, but
before he could finish Madam Bones had said, “And those in favor of
conviction?”

Fudge raised his hand; so did half a dozen others, including the
witch on his right and the heavily mustached wizard and the frizzyhaired witch in the second row.
Fudge glanced around at them all, looking as though there was
something large stuck in his throat, then lowered his own hand. He
took two deep breaths and then said, in a voice distorted by suppressed rage, “Very well, very well . . . cleared of all charges.”
“Excellent,” said Dumbledore briskly, springing to his feet, pulling
out his wand, and causing the two chintz armchairs to vanish. “Well, I
must be getting along. Good day to you all.”
And without looking once at Harry, he swept from the dungeon.

THE WOES OF
MRS. WEASLEY

D

umbledore’s abrupt departure took Harry completely by surprise. He remained sitting where he was in the chained chair,
struggling with his feelings of shock and relief. The Wizengamot were
all getting to their feet, talking, and gathering up their papers and
packing them away. Harry stood up. Nobody seemed to be paying
him the slightest bit of attention except the toadlike witch on Fudge’s
right, who was now gazing down at him instead of at Dumbledore. Ignoring her, he tried to catch Fudge’s eye, or Madam Bones’s, wanting
to ask whether he was free to go, but Fudge seemed quite determined
not to notice Harry, and Madam Bones was busy with her briefcase,
so he took a few tentative steps toward the exit and when nobody
called him back, broke into a very fast walk.
He took the last few steps at a run, wrenched open the door, and almost collided with Mr. Weasley, who was standing right outside,
looking pale and apprehensive.
“Dumbledore didn’t say —”
“Cleared,” Harry said, pulling the door closed behind him, “of all
charges!”


152



THE WOES OF
MRS. WEASLEY
Beaming, Mr. Weasley seized Harry by the shoulders.
“Harry, that’s wonderful! Well, of course, they couldn’t have found
you guilty, not on the evidence, but even so, I can’t pretend I wasn’t —”
But Mr. Weasley broke off, because the courtroom door had just
opened again. The Wizengamot were filing out.
“Merlin’s beard,” said Mr. Weasley wonderingly, pulling Harry
aside to let them all pass, “you were tried by the full court?”
“I think so,” said Harry quietly.
One or two of the passing wizards nodded to Harry as they passed
and a few, including Madam Bones, said, “Morning, Arthur,” to Mr.
Weasley, but most averted their eyes. Cornelius Fudge and the toadlike witch were almost the last to leave the dungeon. Fudge acted as
though Mr. Weasley and Harry were part of the wall, but again, the
witch looked almost appraisingly at Harry as she passed. Last of all to
pass was Percy. Like Fudge, he completely ignored his father and
Harry; he marched past clutching a large roll of parchment and a
handful of spare quills, his back rigid and his nose in the air. The lines
around Mr. Weasley’s mouth tightened slightly, but other than this he
gave no sign that he had noticed his third son.
“I’m going to take you straight back so you can tell the others the
good news,” he said, beckoning Harry forward as Percy’s heels disappeared up the stairs to the ninth level. I’ll drop you off on the way to
that toilet in Bethnal Green. Come on. . . .”
“So what will you have to do about the toilet?” Harry asked, grinning. Everything suddenly seemed five times funnier than usual. It
was starting to sink in: He was cleared, he was going back to Hogwarts.
“Oh, it’s a simple enough anti-jinx,” said Mr. Weasley as they
mounted the stairs, “but it’s not so much having to repair the damage,
it’s more the attitude behind the vandalism, Harry. Muggle-baiting
might strike some wizards as funny, but it’s an expression of something much deeper and nastier, and I for one —”
Mr. Weasley broke off in mid-sentence. They had just reached the


153



CHAPTER NINE
ninth-level corridor, and Cornelius Fudge was standing a few feet
away from them, talking quietly to a tall man with sleek blond hair
and a pointed, pale face.
The second man turned at the sound of their footsteps. He too
broke off in mid-conversation, his cold gray eyes narrowed and fixed
upon Harry’s face.
“Well, well, well . . . Patronus Potter,” said Lucius Malfoy coolly.
Harry felt winded, as though he had just walked into something
heavy. He had last seen those cool gray eyes through slits in a Death
Eater’s hood, and last heard that man’s voice jeering in a dark graveyard while Lord Voldemort tortured him. He could not believe that
Lucius Malfoy dared look him in the face; he could not believe that he
was here, in the Ministry of Magic, or that Cornelius Fudge was talking to him, when Harry had told Fudge mere weeks ago that Malfoy
was a Death Eater.
“The Minister was just telling me about your lucky escape, Potter,”
drawled Mr. Malfoy. “Quite astonishing, the way you continue to
wriggle out of very tight holes. . . . Snakelike, in fact . . .”
Mr. Weasley gripped Harry’s shoulder in warning.
“Yeah,” said Harry, “yeah, I’m good at escaping. . . .”
Lucius Malfoy raised his eyes to Mr. Weasley’s face.
“And Arthur Weasley too! What are you doing here, Arthur?”
“I work here,” said Mr. Weasley shortly.
“Not here, surely?” said Mr. Malfoy, raising his eyebrows and glancing toward the door over Mr. Weasley’s shoulder. “I thought you were
up on the second floor. . . . Don’t you do something that involves
sneaking Muggle artifacts home and bewitching them?”
“No,” said Mr. Weasley curtly, his fingers now biting into Harry’s
shoulder.
“What are you doing here anyway?” Harry asked Lucius Malfoy.
“I don’t think private matters between myself and the Minister are
any concern of yours, Potter,” said Malfoy, smoothing the front of his


robes; Harry distinctly heard the gentle clinking of what sounded like
a full pocket of gold. “Really, just because you are Dumbledore’s favorite boy, you must not expect the same indulgence from the rest of
us. . . . Shall we go up to your office, then, Minister?”
“Certainly,” said Fudge, turning his back on Harry and Mr.
Weasley. “This way, Lucius.”
They strode off together, talking in low voices. Mr. Weasley did not
let go of Harry’s shoulder until they had disappeared into the lift.
“Why wasn’t he waiting outside Fudge’s office if they’ve got business to do together?” Harry burst out furiously. “What was he doing
down here?”
“Trying to sneak down to the courtroom, if you ask me,” said Mr.
Weasley, looking extremely agitated as he glanced over his shoulder as
though making sure they could not be overheard. “Trying to find out
whether you’d been expelled or not. I’ll leave a note for Dumbledore
when I drop you off, he ought to know Malfoy’s been talking to Fudge
again.”
“What private business have they got together anyway?”
“Gold, I expect,” said Mr. Weasley angrily. “Malfoy’s been giving
generously to all sorts of things for years. . . . Gets him in with the
right people . . . then he can ask favors . . . delay laws he doesn’t want
passed . . . Oh, he’s very well connected, Lucius Malfoy. . . .”
The lift arrived; it was empty except for a flock of memos that
flapped around Mr. Weasley’s head as he pressed the button for the
Atrium and the doors clanged shut; he waved them away irritably.
“Mr. Weasley,” said Harry slowly, “if Fudge is meeting Death
Eaters like Malfoy, if he’s seeing them alone, how do we know they
haven’t put the Imperius Curse on him?”
“Don’t think it hadn’t occurred to us, Harry,” muttered Mr.
Weasley. “But Dumbledore thinks Fudge is acting of his own accord
at the moment — which, as Dumbledore says, is not a lot of comfort.
. . . Best not talk about it anymore just now, Harry. . . .”

The doors slid open and they stepped out into the now almostdeserted Atrium. Eric the security man was hidden behind his Daily
Prophet again. They had walked straight past the golden fountain before Harry remembered.
“Wait. . . .” he told Mr. Weasley, and pulling his money bag from
his pocket, he turned back to the fountain.
He looked up into the handsome wizard’s face, but up close, Harry
thought he looked rather weak and foolish. The witch was wearing a
vapid smile like a beauty contestant, and from what Harry knew of
goblins and centaurs, they were most unlikely to be caught staring this
soppily at humans of any description. Only the house-elf ’s attitude of
creeping servility looked convincing. With a grin at the thought of
what Hermione would say if she could see the statue of the elf, Harry
turned his money bag upside down and emptied not just ten
Galleons, but the whole contents into the pool at the statues’ feet.
“I knew it!” yelled Ron, punching the air. “You always get away with
stuff !”
“They were bound to clear you,” said Hermione, who had looked
positively faint with anxiety when Harry had entered the kitchen and
was now holding a shaking hand over her eyes. “There was no case
against you, none at all. . . .”
“Everyone seems quite relieved, though, considering they all knew
I’d get off,” said Harry, smiling.
Mrs. Weasley was wiping her face on her apron, and Fred, George,
and Ginny were doing a kind of war dance to a chant that went “He
got off, he got off, he got off —”
“That’s enough, settle down!” shouted Mr. Weasley, though he too
was smiling. “Listen, Sirius, Lucius Malfoy was at the Ministry —”
“What?” said Sirius sharply.
“He got off, he got off, he got off —”
“Be quiet, you three! Yes, we saw him talking to Fudge on level

nine, then they went up to Fudge’s office together. Dumbledore ought
to know.”
“Absolutely,” said Sirius. “We’ll tell him, don’t worry.”
“Well, I’d better get going, there’s a vomiting toilet in Bethnal
Green waiting for me. Molly, I’ll be late, I’m covering for Tonks, but
Kingsley might be dropping in for dinner —”
“He got off, he got off, he got off —”
“That’s enough — Fred — George — Ginny!” said Mrs. Weasley,
as Mr. Weasley left the kitchen. “Harry dear, come and sit down, have
some lunch, you hardly ate breakfast. . . .”
Ron and Hermione sat themselves down opposite him looking
happier than they had done since he had first arrived at number
twelve, Grimmauld Place, and Harry’s feeling of giddy relief, which
had been somewhat dented by his encounter with Lucius Malfoy,
swelled again. The gloomy house seemed warmer and more welcoming all of a sudden; even Kreacher looked less ugly as he poked his
snoutlike nose into the kitchen to investigate the source of all the
noise.
“ ’Course, once Dumbledore turned up on your side, there was no
way they were going to convict you,” said Ron happily, now dishing
great mounds of mashed potatoes onto everyone’s plates.
“Yeah, he swung it for me,” said Harry. He felt that it would sound
highly ungrateful, not to mention childish, to say, “I wish he’d talked
to me, though. Or even looked at me.”
And as he thought this, the scar on his forehead burned so badly
that he clapped his hand to it.
“What’s up?” said Hermione, looking alarmed.
“Scar,” Harry mumbled. “But it’s nothing. . . . It happens all the
time now. . . .”
None of the others had noticed a thing; all of them were now helping themselves to food while gloating over Harry’s narrow escape;
Fred, George, and Ginny were still singing. Hermione looked rather


CHAPTER NINE
anxious, but before she could say anything, Ron said happily, “I bet
Dumbledore turns up this evening to celebrate with us, you know.”
“I don’t think he’ll be able to, Ron,” said Mrs. Weasley, setting a
huge plate of roast chicken down in front of Harry. “He’s really very
busy at the moment.”
“HE GOT OFF, HE GOT OFF, HE GOT OFF —”
“SHUT UP!” roared Mrs. Weasley.
Over the next few days Harry could not help noticing that there was
one person within number twelve, Grimmauld Place, who did not
seem wholly overjoyed that he would be returning to Hogwarts. Sirius had put up a very good show of happiness on first hearing the
news, wringing Harry’s hand and beaming just like the rest of them;
soon, however, he was moodier and surlier than before, talking less to
everybody, even Harry, and spending increasing amounts of time shut
up in his mother’s room with Buckbeak.
“Don’t you go feeling guilty!” said Hermione sternly, after Harry
had confided some of his feelings to her and Ron while they
scrubbed out a moldy cupboard on the third floor a few days later.
“You belong at Hogwarts and Sirius knows it. Personally, I think he’s
being selfish.”
“That’s a bit harsh, Hermione,” said Ron, frowning as he attempted to prize off a bit of mold that had attached itself firmly to his
finger, “you wouldn’t want to be stuck inside this house without
company.”
“He’ll have company!” said Hermione. “It’s headquarters to the
Order of the Phoenix, isn’t it? He just got his hopes up that Harry
would be coming to live here with him.”
“I don’t think that’s true,” said Harry, wringing out his cloth. “He
wouldn’t give me a straight answer when I asked him if I could.”
“He just didn’t want to get his own hopes up even more,” said
Hermione wisely. “And he probably felt a bit guilty himself, because I


158



THE WOES OF
MRS. WEASLEY
think a part of him was really hoping you’d be expelled. Then you’d
both be outcasts together.”
“Come off it!” said Harry and Ron together, but Hermione merely
shrugged.
“Suit yourselves. But I sometimes think Ron’s mum’s right, and Sirius gets confused about whether you’re you or your father, Harry.”
“So you think he’s touched in the head?” said Harry heatedly.
“No, I just think he’s been very lonely for a long time,” said
Hermione simply.
At this point Mrs. Weasley entered the bedroom behind them.
“Still not finished?” she said, poking her head into the cupboard.
“I thought you might be here to tell us to have a break!” said Ron
bitterly. “D’you know how much mold we’ve got rid of since we arrived here?”
“You were so keen to help the Order,” said Mrs. Weasley, “you can
do your bit by making headquarters fit to live in.”
“I feel like a house-elf,” grumbled Ron.
“Well, now that you understand what dreadful lives they lead, perhaps you’ll be a bit more active in S.P.E.W.!” said Hermione hopefully,
as Mrs. Weasley left them to it again. “You know, maybe it wouldn’t
be a bad idea to show people exactly how horrible it is to clean all the
time — we could do a sponsored scrub of Gryffindor common room,
all proceeds to S.P.E.W., it would raise awareness as well as funds —”
“I’ll sponsor you to shut up about spew,” Ron muttered irritably,
but only so Harry could hear him.
Harry found himself daydreaming about Hogwarts more and more
as the end of the holidays approached; he could not wait to see Hagrid
again, to play Quidditch, even to stroll across the vegetable patches to
the Herbology greenhouses. It would be a treat just to leave this dusty,
musty house, where half of the cupboards were still bolted shut and
Kreacher wheezed insults out of the shadows as you passed, though
Harry was careful not to say any of this within earshot of Sirius.


CHAPTER NINE
The fact was that living at the headquarters of the anti-Voldemort
movement was not nearly as interesting or exciting as Harry would
have expected before he’d experienced it. Though members of the Order of the Phoenix came and went regularly, sometimes staying for
meals, sometimes only for a few minutes’ whispered conversation,
Mrs. Weasley made sure that Harry and the others were kept well out
of earshot (whether Extendable or normal) and nobody, not even Sirius, seemed to feel that Harry needed to know anything more than he
had heard on the night of his arrival.
On the very last day of the holidays Harry was sweeping up Hedwig’s owl droppings from the top of the wardrobe when Ron entered
their bedroom carrying a couple of envelopes.
“Booklists have arrived,” he said, throwing one of the envelopes up
to Harry, who was standing on a chair. “About time, I thought they’d
forgotten, they usually come much earlier than this. . . .”
Harry swept the last of the droppings into a rubbish bag and threw
the bag over Ron’s head into the wastepaper basket in the corner,
which swallowed it and belched loudly. He then opened his letter: It
contained two pieces of parchment, one the usual reminder that term
started on the first of September, the other telling him which books he
would need for the coming year.
“Only two new ones,” he said, reading the list. “The Standard Book
of Spells, Grade 5, by Miranda Goshawk and Defensive Magical Theory,
by Wilbert Slinkhard.”
Crack.
Fred and George Apparated right beside Harry. He was so used to
them doing this by now that he didn’t even fall off his chair.
“We were just wondering who assigned the Slinkhard book,” said
Fred conversationally.
“Because it means Dumbledore’s found a new Defense Against the
Dark Arts teacher,” said George.


THE WOES OF
MRS. WEASLEY
“And about time too,” said Fred.
“What d’you mean?” Harry asked, jumping down beside them.
“Well, we overheard Mum and Dad talking on the Extendable Ears
a few weeks back,” Fred told Harry, “and from what they were saying,
Dumbledore was having real trouble finding anyone to do the job this
year.”
“Not surprising, is it, when you look at what’s happened to the last
four?” said George.
“One sacked, one dead, one’s memory removed, and one locked in
a trunk for nine months,” said Harry, counting them off on his fingers. “Yeah, I see what you mean.”
“What’s up with you, Ron?” asked Fred.
Ron did not answer. Harry looked around. Ron was standing very
still with his mouth slightly open, gaping at his letter from Hogwarts.
“What’s the matter?” said Fred impatiently, moving around Ron to
look over his shoulder at the parchment.
Fred’s mouth fell open too.
“Prefect?” he said, staring incredulously at the letter. “Prefect?”
George leapt forward, seized the envelope in Ron’s other hand, and
turned it upside down. Harry saw something scarlet and gold fall into
George’s palm.
“No way,” said George in a hushed voice.
“There’s been a mistake,” said Fred, snatching the letter out of
Ron’s grasp and holding it up to the light as though checking for a watermark. “No one in their right mind would make Ron a prefect. . . .”
The twins’ heads turned in unison and both of them stared at
Harry.
“We thought you were a cert!” said Fred in a tone that suggested
Harry had tricked them in some way.
“We thought Dumbledore was bound to pick you!” said George
indignantly.

“Winning the Triwizard and everything!” said Fred.
“I suppose all the mad stuff must’ve counted against him,” said
George to Fred.
“Yeah,” said Fred slowly. “Yeah, you’ve caused too much trouble,
mate. Well, at least one of you’s got their priorities right.”
He strode over to Harry and clapped him on the back while giving
Ron a scathing look.
“Prefect . . . ickle Ronnie the prefect . . .”
“Oh, Mum’s going to be revolting,” groaned George, thrusting the
prefect badge back at Ron as though it might contaminate him.
Ron, who still had not said a word, took the badge, stared at it for
a moment, and then held it out to Harry as though asking mutely for
confirmation that it was genuine. Harry took it. A large P was superimposed on the Gryffindor lion. He had seen a badge just like this on
Percy’s chest on his very first day at Hogwarts.
The door banged open. Hermione came tearing into the room, her
cheeks flushed and her hair flying. There was an envelope in her hand.
“Did you — did you get — ?”
She spotted the badge in Harry’s hand and let out a shriek.
“I knew it!” she said excitedly, brandishing her letter. “Me too,
Harry, me too!”
“No,” said Harry quickly, pushing the badge back into Ron’s hand.
“It’s Ron, not me.”
“It — what?”
“Ron’s prefect, not me,” Harry said.
“Ron?” said Hermione, her jaw dropping. “But . . . are you sure? I
mean —”
She turned red as Ron looked around at her with a defiant expression on his face.
“It’s my name on the letter,” he said.
“I . . .” said Hermione, looking thoroughly bewildered. “I . . . well
. . . wow! Well done, Ron! That’s really —”

“Unexpected,” said George, nodding.
“No,” said Hermione, blushing harder than ever, “no, it’s not . . .
Ron’s done loads of . . . he’s really . . .”
The door behind her opened a little wider and Mrs. Weasley
backed into the room carrying a pile of freshly laundered robes.
“Ginny said the booklists had come at last,” she said, glancing
around at all the envelopes as she made her way over to the bed and
started sorting the robes into two piles. “If you give them to me I’ll
take them over to Diagon Alley this afternoon and get your books
while you’re packing. Ron, I’ll have to get you more pajamas, these are
at least six inches too short, I can’t believe how fast you’re growing . . .
what color would you like?”
“Get him red and gold to match his badge,” said George, smirking.
“Match his what?” said Mrs. Weasley absently, rolling up a pair of
maroon socks and placing them on Ron’s pile.
“His badge,” said Fred, with the air of getting the worst over
quickly. “His lovely shiny new prefect’s badge.”
Fred’s words took a moment to penetrate Mrs. Weasley’s preoccupation about pajamas.
“His . . . but . . . Ron, you’re not. . . ?”
Ron held up his badge.
Mrs. Weasley let out a shriek just like Hermione’s.
“I don’t believe it! I don’t believe it! Oh, Ron, how wonderful! A
prefect! That’s everyone in the family!”
“What are Fred and I, next-door neighbors?” said George indignantly, as his mother pushed him aside and flung her arms around her
youngest son.
“Wait until your father hears! Ron, I’m so proud of you, what wonderful news, you could end up Head Boy just like Bill and Percy, it’s
the first step! Oh, what a thing to happen in the middle of all this
worry, I’m just thrilled, oh Ronnie —”
Fred and George were both making loud retching noises behind

her back but Mrs. Weasley did not notice; arms tight around Ron’s
neck, she was kissing him all over his face, which had turned a brighter
scarlet than his badge.
“Mum . . . don’t . . . Mum, get a grip. . . .” he muttered, trying to
push her away.
She let go of him and said breathlessly, “Well, what will it be? We
gave Percy an owl, but you’ve already got one, of course.”
“W-what do you mean?” said Ron, looking as though he did not
dare believe his ears.
“You’ve got to have a reward for this!” said Mrs. Weasley fondly.
“How about a nice new set of dress robes?”
“We’ve already bought him some,” said Fred sourly, who looked as
though he sincerely regretted this generosity.
“Or a new cauldron, Charlie’s old one’s rusting through, or a new
rat, you always liked Scabbers —”
“Mum,” said Ron hopefully, “can I have a new broom?”
Mrs. Weasley’s face fell slightly; broomsticks were expensive.
“Not a really good one!” Ron hastened to add. “Just — just a new
one for a change . . .”
Mrs. Weasley hesitated, then smiled.
“Of course you can. . . . Well, I’d better get going if I’ve got a broom
to buy too. I’ll see you all later. . . . Little Ronnie, a prefect! And don’t
forget to pack your trunks. . . . A prefect . . . Oh, I’m all of a dither!”
She gave Ron yet another kiss on the cheek, sniffed loudly, and bustled from the room.
Fred and George exchanged looks.
“You don’t mind if we don’t kiss you, do you, Ron?” said Fred in a
falsely anxious voice.
“We could curtsy, if you like,” said George.
“Oh, shut up,” said Ron, scowling at them.
“Or what?” said Fred, an evil grin spreading across his face. “Going
to put us in detention?”

“I’d love to see him try,” sniggered George.
“He could if you don’t watch out!” said Hermione angrily, at which
Fred and George burst out laughing and Ron muttered, “Drop it,
Hermione.”
“We’re going to have to watch our step, George,” said Fred, pretending to tremble, “with these two on our case. . . .”
“Yeah, it looks like our law-breaking days are finally over,” said
George, shaking his head.
And with another loud crack, the twins Disapparated.
“Those two!” said Hermione furiously, staring up at the ceiling,
through which they could now hear Fred and George roaring with
laughter in the room upstairs. “Don’t pay any attention to them, Ron,
they’re only jealous!”
“I don’t think they are,” said Ron doubtfully, also looking up at the
ceiling. “They’ve always said only prats become prefects. . . . Still,” he
added on a happier note, “they’ve never had new brooms! I wish I
could go with Mum and choose. . . . She’ll never be able to afford a
Nimbus, but there’s the new Cleansweep out, that’d be great. . . .
Yeah, I think I’ll go and tell her I like the Cleansweep, just so she
knows. . . .”
He dashed from the room, leaving Harry and Hermione alone.
For some reason, Harry found that he did not want to look at
Hermione. He turned to his bed, picked up the pile of clean robes
Mrs. Weasley had laid upon it, and crossed the room to his trunk.
“Harry?” said Hermione tentatively.
“Well done,” said Harry, so heartily it did not sound like his voice
at all, and still not looking at her. “Brilliant. Prefect. Great.”
“Thanks,” said Hermione. “Erm — Harry — could I borrow
Hedwig so I can tell Mum and Dad? They’ll be really pleased — I
mean, prefect is something they can understand —”
“Yeah, no problem,” said Harry, still in the horrible hearty voice
that did not belong to him. “Take her!”


CHAPTER NINE
He leaned over his trunk, laid the robes on the bottom of it, and pretended to be rummaging for something while Hermione crossed to the
wardrobe and called Hedwig down. A few moments passed; Harry
heard the door close but remained bent double, listening; the only
sounds he could hear were the blank picture on the wall sniggering again
and the wastepaper basket in the corner coughing up the owl droppings.
He straightened up and looked behind him. Hermione and Hedwig had gone. Harry returned slowly to his bed and sank onto it, gazing unseeingly at the foot of the wardrobe.
He had forgotten completely about prefects being chosen in the
fifth year. He had been too anxious about the possibility of being expelled to spare a thought for the fact that badges must be winging
their way toward certain people. But if he had remembered . . . if he
had thought about it . . . what would he have expected?
Not this, said a small and truthful voice inside his head.
Harry screwed up his face and buried it in his hands. He could not
lie to himself; if he had known the prefect badge was on its way, he
would have expected it to come to him, not Ron. Did this make him
as arrogant as Draco Malfoy? Did he think himself superior to everyone else? Did he really believe he was better than Ron?
No, said the small voice defiantly.
Was that true? Harry wondered, anxiously probing his own feelings.
I’m better at Quidditch, said the voice. But I’m not better at anything
else.
That was definitely true, Harry thought; he was no better than Ron
in lessons. But what about outside lessons? What about those adventures he, Ron, and Hermione had had together since they had started
at Hogwarts, often risking much worse than expulsion?
Well, Ron and Hermione were with me most of the time, said the voice
in Harry’s head.
Not all the time, though, Harry argued with himself. They didn’t fight


166

THE WOES OF
MRS. WEASLEY
Quirrell with me. They didn’t take on Riddle and the basilisk. They didn’t
get rid of all those dementors the night Sirius escaped. They weren’t in that
graveyard with me, the night Voldemort returned. . . .
And the same feeling of ill usage that had overwhelmed him on
the night he had arrived rose again. I’ve definitely done more, Harry
thought indignantly. I’ve done more than either of them!
But maybe, said the small voice fairly, maybe Dumbledore doesn’t
choose prefects because they’ve got themselves into a load of dangerous situations. . . . Maybe he chooses them for other reasons. . . . Ron must have
something you don’t. . . .
Harry opened his eyes and stared through his fingers at the wardrobe’s clawed feet, remembering what Fred had said.
“No one in their right mind would make Ron a prefect. . . .”
Harry gave a small snort of laughter. A second later he felt sickened
with himself.
Ron had not asked Dumbledore to give him the prefect badge. This
was not Ron’s fault. Was he, Harry, Ron’s best friend in the world,
going to sulk because he didn’t have a badge, laugh with the twins
behind Ron’s back, ruin this for Ron when, for the first time, he had
beaten Harry at something?
At this point Harry heard Ron’s footsteps on the stairs again. He
stood up, straightened his glasses, and hitched a grin onto his face as
Ron bounded back through the door.
“Just caught her!” he said happily. “She says she’ll get the Cleansweep if she can.”
“Cool,” Harry said, and he was relieved to hear that his voice had
stopped sounding hearty. “Listen — Ron — well done, mate.”
The smile faded off Ron’s face.
“I never thought it would be me!” he said, shaking his head, “I
thought it would be you!”
“Nah, I’ve caused too much trouble,” Harry said, echoing Fred.


CHAPTER NINE
“Yeah,” said Ron, “yeah, I suppose. . . . Well, we’d better get our
trunks packed, hadn’t we?”
It was odd how widely their possessions seemed to have scattered
themselves since they had arrived. It took them most of the afternoon
to retrieve their books and belongings from all over the house and
stow them back inside their school trunks. Harry noticed that Ron
kept moving his prefect’s badge around, first placing it on his bedside
table, then putting it into his jeans pocket, then taking it out and laying it on his folded robes, as though to see the effect of the red on the
black. Only when Fred and George dropped in and offered to attach
it to his forehead with a Permanent Sticking Charm did he wrap it
tenderly in his maroon socks and lock it in his trunk.
Mrs. Weasley returned from Diagon Alley around six o’clock, laden
with books and carrying a long package wrapped in thick brown paper that Ron took from her with a moan of longing.
“Never mind unwrapping it now, people are arriving for dinner, I
want you all downstairs,” she said, but the moment she was out of
sight Ron ripped off the paper in a frenzy and examined every inch of
his new broom, an ecstatic expression on his face.
Down in the basement Mrs. Weasley had hung a scarlet banner
over the heavily laden dinner table, which read congratulations
ron and hermione — new prefects. She looked in a better mood
than Harry had seen her all holiday.
“I thought we’d have a little party, not a sit-down dinner,” she told
Harry, Ron, Hermione, Fred, George, and Ginny as they entered the
room. “Your father and Bill are on their way, Ron, I’ve sent them both
owls and they’re thrilled,” she added, beaming.
Fred rolled his eyes.
Sirius, Lupin, Tonks, and Kingsley Shacklebolt were already there
and Mad-Eye Moody stumped in shortly after Harry had got himself
a butterbeer.
“Oh, Alastor, I am glad you’re here,” said Mrs. Weasley brightly, as


THE WOES OF

Mad-Eye shrugged off his traveling cloak. “We’ve been wanting to ask
you for ages — could you have a look in the writing desk in the drawing room and tell us what’s inside it? We haven’t wanted to open it just
in case it’s something really nasty.”
“No problem, Molly . . .”
Moody’s electric-blue eye swiveled upward and stared fixedly
through the ceiling of the kitchen.
“Drawing room . . .” he growled, as the pupil contracted. “Desk in
the corner? Yeah, I see it. . . . Yeah, it’s a boggart. . . . Want me to go
up and get rid of it, Molly?”
“No, no, I’ll do it myself later,” beamed Mrs. Weasley. “You have
your drink. We’re having a little bit of a celebration, actually. . . .” She
gestured at the scarlet banner. “Fourth prefect in the family!” she said
fondly, ruffling Ron’s hair.
“Prefect, eh?” growled Moody, his normal eye on Ron and his magical eye swiveling around to gaze into the side of his head. Harry had
the very uncomfortable feeling it was looking at him and moved away
toward Sirius and Lupin.
“Well, congratulations,” said Moody, still glaring at Ron with his
normal eye, “authority figures always attract trouble, but I suppose
Dumbledore thinks you can withstand most major jinxes or he
wouldn’t have appointed you. . . .”
Ron looked rather startled at this view of the matter but was saved
the trouble of responding by the arrival of his father and eldest
brother. Mrs. Weasley was in such a good mood she did not even
complain that they had brought Mundungus with them too; he was
wearing a long overcoat that seemed oddly lumpy in unlikely places
and declined the offer to remove it and put it with Moody’s traveling
cloak.
“Well, I think a toast is in order,” said Mr. Weasley, when everyone
had a drink. He raised his goblet. “To Ron and Hermione, the new
Gryffindor prefects!”

Ron and Hermione beamed as everyone drank to them and then
applauded.
“I was never a prefect myself,” said Tonks brightly from behind
Harry as everybody moved toward the table to help themselves to
food. Her hair was tomato-red and waist length today; she looked like
Ginny’s older sister. “My Head of House said I lacked certain necessary qualities.”
“Like what?” said Ginny, who was choosing a baked potato.
“Like the ability to behave myself,” said Tonks.
Ginny laughed; Hermione looked as though she did not know
whether to smile or not and compromised by taking an extra large
gulp of butterbeer and choking on it.
“What about you, Sirius?” Ginny asked, thumping Hermione on
the back.
Sirius, who was right beside Harry, let out his usual barklike laugh.
“No one would have made me a prefect, I spent too much time in
detention with James. Lupin was the good boy, he got the badge.”
“I think Dumbledore might have hoped that I would be able to exercise some control over my best friends,” said Lupin. “I need scarcely
say that I failed dismally.”
Harry’s mood suddenly lifted. His father had not been a prefect either. All at once the party seemed much more enjoyable; he loaded up
his plate, feeling unusually fond of everyone in the room.
Ron was rhapsodizing about his new broom to anybody who would
listen.
“. . . naught to seventy in ten seconds, not bad, is it? When you
think the Comet Two Ninety’s only naught to sixty and that’s with a
decent tailwind according to Which Broomstick?”
Hermione was talking very earnestly to Lupin about her view of elf
rights.
“I mean, it’s the same kind of nonsense as werewolf segregation,

isn’t it? It all stems from this horrible thing wizards have of thinking
they’re superior to other creatures. . . .”
Mrs. Weasley and Bill were having their usual argument about Bill’s
hair.
“. . . getting really out of hand, and you’re so good-looking, it
would look much better shorter, wouldn’t it, Harry?”
“Oh — I dunno —” said Harry, slightly alarmed at being asked his
opinion; he slid away from them in the direction of Fred and George,
who were huddled in a corner with Mundungus.
Mundungus stopped talking when he saw Harry, but Fred winked
and beckoned Harry closer.
“It’s okay,” he told Mundungus, “we can trust Harry, he’s our financial backer.”
“Look what Dung’s gotten us,” said George, holding out his hand
to Harry. It was full of what looked like shriveled black pods. A faint
rattling noise was coming from them, even though they were completely stationary.
“Venomous Tentacula seeds,” said George. “We need them for the
Skiving Snackboxes but they’re a Class C Non-Tradeable Substance so
we’ve been having a bit of trouble getting hold of them.”
“Ten Galleons the lot, then, Dung?” said Fred.
“Wiv all the trouble I went to to get ’em?” said Mundungus, his
saggy, bloodshot eyes stretching even wider. “I’m sorry, lads, but I’m
not taking a Knut under twenty.”
“Dung likes his little joke,” Fred said to Harry.
“Yeah, his best one so far has been six Sickles for a bag of knarl
quills,” said George.
“Be careful,” Harry warned them quietly.
“What?” said Fred. “Mum’s busy cooing over Prefect Ron, we’re
okay.”
“But Moody could have his eye on you,” Harry pointed out.

Mundungus looked nervously over his shoulder.
“Good point, that,” he grunted. “All right, lads, ten it is, if you’ll
take ’em quick.”
“Cheers, Harry!” said Fred delightedly, when Mundungus had
emptied his pockets into the twins’ outstretched hands and scuttled
off toward the food. “We’d better get these upstairs. . . .”
Harry watched them go, feeling slightly uneasy. It had just occurred to him that Mr. and Mrs. Weasley would want to know how
Fred and George were financing their joke shop business when, as was
inevitable, they finally found out about it. Giving the twins his Triwizard winnings had seemed a simple thing to do at the time, but
what if it led to another family row and a Percy-like estrangement?
Would Mrs. Weasley still feel that Harry was as good as her son if she
found out he had made it possible for Fred and George to start a career she thought quite unsuitable?
Standing where the twins had left him with nothing but a guilty
weight in the pit of his stomach for company, Harry caught the sound
of his own name. Kingsley Shacklebolt’s deep voice was audible even
over the surrounding chatter.
“. . . why Dumbledore didn’t make Potter a prefect?” said Kingsley.
“He’ll have had his reasons,” replied Lupin.
“But it would’ve shown confidence in him. It’s what I’d’ve done,”
persisted Kingsley, “ ’specially with the Daily Prophet having a go at
him every few days. . . .”
Harry did not look around; he did not want Lupin or Kingsley to
know he had heard. He followed Mundungus back toward the table,
though not remotely hungry. His pleasure in the party had evaporated
as quickly as it had come; he wished he were upstairs in bed.
Mad-Eye Moody was sniffing at a chicken leg with what remained
of his nose; evidently he could not detect any trace of poison, because
he then tore a strip off it with his teeth.

“. . . the handle’s made of Spanish oak with anti-jinx varnish and
in-built vibration control —” Ron was saying to Tonks.
Mrs. Weasley yawned widely.
“Well, I think I’ll sort out that boggart before I turn in. . . . Arthur,
I don’t want this lot up too late, all right? ’Night, Harry, dear.”
She left the kitchen. Harry set down his plate and wondered
whether he could follow her without attracting attention.
“You all right, Potter?” grunted Moody.
“Yeah, fine,” lied Harry.
Moody took a swig from his hip flask, his electric blue eye staring
sideways at Harry.
“Come here, I’ve got something that might interest you,” he said.
From an inner pocket of his robes Moody pulled a very tattered old
Wizarding photograph.
“Original Order of the Phoenix,” growled Moody. “Found it last
night when I was looking for my spare Invisibility Cloak, seeing as
Podmore hasn’t had the manners to return my best one. . . . Thought
people might like to see it.”
Harry took the photograph. A small crowd of people, some waving
at him, others lifting their glasses, looked back up at him.
“There’s me,” said Moody unnecessarily, pointing at himself. The
Moody in the picture was unmistakable, though his hair was slightly
less gray and his nose was intact. “And there’s Dumbledore beside me,
Dedalus Diggle on the other side . . . That’s Marlene McKinnon, she
was killed two weeks after this was taken, they got her whole family.
That’s Frank and Alice Longbottom —”
Harry’s stomach, already uncomfortable, clenched as he looked at
Alice Longbottom; he knew her round, friendly face very well, even
though he had never met her, because she was the image of her son,
Neville.
“Poor devils,” growled Moody. “Better dead than what happened

to them . . . and that’s Emmeline Vance, you’ve met her, and that
there’s Lupin, obviously . . . Benjy Fenwick, he copped it too, we only
ever found bits of him . . . shift aside there,” he added, poking the picture, and the little photographic people edged sideways, so that those
who were partially obscured could move to the front.
“That’s Edgar Bones . . . brother of Amelia Bones, they got him and
his family too, he was a great wizard . . . Sturgis Podmore, blimey, he
looks young . . . Caradoc Dearborn, vanished six months after this, we
never found his body . . . Hagrid, of course, looks exactly the same as
ever . . . Elphias Doge, you’ve met him, I’d forgotten he used to wear
that stupid hat . . . Gideon Prewett, it took five Death Eaters to kill
him and his brother Fabian, they fought like heroes . . . budge along,
budge along . . .”
The little people in the photograph jostled among themselves, and
those hidden right at the back appeared at the forefront of the picture.
“That’s Dumbledore’s brother, Aberforth, only time I ever met him,
strange bloke . . . That’s Dorcas Meadowes, Voldemort killed her personally . . . Sirius, when he still had short hair . . . and . . . there you
go, thought that would interest you!”
Harry’s heart turned over. His mother and father were beaming up
at him, sitting on either side of a small, watery-eyed man Harry recognized at once as Wormtail: He was the one who had betrayed their
whereabouts to Voldemort and so helped bring about their deaths.
“Eh?” said Moody.
Harry looked up into Moody’s heavily scarred and pitted face. Evidently Moody was under the impression he had just given Harry a bit
of a treat.
“Yeah,” said Harry, attempting to grin again. “Er . . . listen, I’ve
just remembered, I haven’t packed my . . .”
He was spared the trouble of inventing an object he had not
packed; Sirius had just said, “What’s that you’ve got there, Mad-Eye?”
and Moody had turned toward him. Harry crossed the kitchen,


174



THE WOES OF
MRS. WEASLEY
slipped through the door and up the stairs before anyone could call
him back.
He did not know why he had received such a shock; he had seen his
parents’ pictures before, after all, and he had met Wormtail . . . but to
have them sprung on him like that, when he was least expecting it . . .
No one would like that, he thought angrily. . . .
And then, to see them surrounded by all those other happy faces
. . . Benjy Fenwick, who had been found in bits, and Gideon Prewett,
who had died like a hero, and the Longbottoms, who had been tortured into madness . . . all waving happily out of the photograph
forevermore, not knowing that they were doomed. . . . Well, Moody
might find that interesting . . . he, Harry, found it disturbing. . . .
Harry tiptoed up the stairs in the hall past the stuffed elf heads,
glad to be on his own again, but as he approached the first landing he
heard noises. Someone was sobbing in the drawing room.
“Hello?” Harry said.
There was no answer but the sobbing continued. He climbed the
remaining stairs two at a time, walked across the landing, and opened
the drawing-room door.
Someone was cowering against the dark wall, her wand in her
hand, her whole body shaking with sobs. Sprawled on the dusty old
carpet in a patch of moonlight, clearly dead, was Ron.
All the air seemed to vanish from Harry’s lungs; he felt as though he
were falling through the floor; his brain turned icy cold — Ron dead,
no, it couldn’t be —
But wait a moment, it couldn’t be — Ron was downstairs —
“Mrs. Weasley?” Harry croaked.
“R-r-riddikulus!’’ Mrs. Weasley sobbed, pointing her shaking wand
at Ron’s body.
Crack.
Ron’s body turned into Bill’s, spread-eagled on his back, his eyes
wide open and empty. Mrs. Weasley sobbed harder than ever.


175



CHAPTER NINE
“R-riddikulus!” she sobbed again.
Crack.
Mr. Weasley’s body replaced Bill’s, his glasses askew, a trickle of
blood running down his face.
“No!” Mrs. Weasley moaned. “No . . . riddikulus! Riddikulus!
RIDDIKULUS !”
Crack. Dead twins. Crack. Dead Percy. Crack. Dead Harry . . .
“Mrs. Weasley, just get out of here!” shouted Harry, staring down
at his own dead body on the floor. “Let someone else —”
“What’s going on?”
Lupin had come running into the room, closely followed by Sirius,
with Moody stumping along behind them. Lupin looked from Mrs.
Weasley to the dead Harry on the floor and seemed to understand in
an instant. Pulling out his own wand he said, very firmly and clearly,
“Riddikulus!”
Harry’s body vanished. A silvery orb hung in the air over the spot
where it had lain. Lupin waved his wand once more and the orb vanished in a puff of smoke.
“Oh — oh — oh!” gulped Mrs. Weasley, and she broke into a
storm of crying, her face in her hands.
“Molly,” said Lupin bleakly, walking over to her, “Molly, don’t . . .”
Next second she was sobbing her heart out on Lupin’s shoulder.
“Molly, it was just a boggart,” he said soothingly, patting her on the
head. “Just a stupid boggart . . .”
“I see them d-d-dead all the time!” Mrs. Weasley moaned into his
shoulder. “All the t-t-time! I d-d-dream about it . . .”
Sirius was staring at the patch of carpet where the boggart, pretending to be Harry’s body, had lain. Moody was looking at Harry,
who avoided his gaze. He had a funny feeling Moody’s magical eye
had followed him all the way out of the kitchen.
“D-d-don’t tell Arthur,” Mrs. Weasley was gulping now, mopping


176



THE WOES OF
MRS. WEASLEY
her eyes frantically with her cuffs. “I d-d-don’t want him to know. . . .
Being silly . . .”
Lupin handed her a handkerchief and she blew her nose.
“Harry, I’m so sorry, what must you think of me?” she said shakily.
“Not even able to get rid of a boggart . . .”
“Don’t be stupid,” said Harry, trying to smile.
“I’m just s-s-so worried,” she said, tears spilling out of her eyes
again. “Half the f-f-family’s in the Order, it’ll b-b-be a miracle if we all
come through this. . . . and P-P-Percy’s not talking to us. . . . What if
something d-d-dreadful happens and we had never m-m-made up?
And what’s going to happen if Arthur and I get killed, who’s g-g-going
to look after Ron and Ginny?”
“Molly, that’s enough,” said Lupin firmly. “This isn’t like last time.
The Order is better prepared, we’ve got a head start, we know what
Voldemort’s up to —”
Mrs. Weasley gave a little squeak of fright at the sound of the name.
“Oh, Molly, come on, it’s about time you got used to hearing it —
look, I can’t promise no one’s going to get hurt, nobody can promise
that, but we’re much better off than we were last time, you weren’t in
the Order then, you don’t understand, last time we were outnumbered
twenty to one by the Death Eaters and they were picking us off one by
one. . . .”
Harry thought of the photograph again, of his parents’ beaming
faces. He knew Moody was still watching him.
“Don’t worry about Percy,” said Sirius abruptly. “He’ll come round.
It’s a matter of time before Voldemort moves into the open; once he
does, the whole Ministry’s going to be begging us to forgive them.
And I’m not sure I’ll be accepting their apology,” he added bitterly.
“And as for who’s going to look after Ron and Ginny if you and
Arthur died,” said Lupin, smiling slightly, “what do you think we’d
do, let them starve?”


CHAPTER NINE
Mrs. Weasley smiled tremulously.
“Being silly,” she muttered again, mopping her eyes.
But Harry, closing his bedroom door behind him some ten minutes
later, could not think Mrs. Weasley silly. He could still see his parents
beaming up at him from the tattered old photograph, unaware that
their lives, like so many of those around them, were drawing to a close.
The image of the boggart posing as the corpse of each member of Mrs.
Weasley’s family in turn kept flashing before his eyes.
Without warning, the scar on his forehead seared with pain again
and his stomach churned horribly.
“Cut it out,” he said firmly, rubbing the scar as the pain receded
again.
“First sign of madness, talking to your own head,” said a sly voice
from the empty picture on the wall.
Harry ignored it. He felt older than he had ever felt in his life, and
it seemed extraordinary to him that barely an hour ago he had been
worried about a joke shop and who had gotten a prefect’s badge.

H

arry had a troubled night’s sleep. His parents wove in and out
of his dreams, never speaking; Mrs. Weasley sobbed over
Kreacher’s dead body watched by Ron and Hermione, who were wearing crowns, and yet again Harry found himself walking down a corridor ending in a locked door. He awoke abruptly with his scar
prickling to find Ron already dressed and talking to him.
“. . . better hurry up, Mum’s going ballistic, she says we’re going to
miss the train. . . .”
There was a lot of commotion in the house. From what he heard as
he dressed at top speed, Harry gathered that Fred and George had bewitched their trunks to fly downstairs to save the bother of carrying
them, with the result that they had hurtled straight into Ginny and
knocked her down two flights of stairs into the hall; Mrs. Black and
Mrs. Weasley were both screaming at the top of their voices.
“— COULD HAVE DONE HER A SERIOUS INJURY, YOU
IDIOTS —”
“— FILTHY HALF-BREEDS, BESMIRCHING THE HOUSE
OF MY FATHERS —”

CHAPTER TEN
Hermione came hurrying into the room looking flustered just as
Harry was putting on his trainers; Hedwig was swaying on her shoulder, and she was carrying a squirming Crookshanks in her arms.
“Mum and Dad just sent Hedwig back” — the owl fluttered obligingly over and perched on top of her cage — “are you ready yet?”
“Nearly — Ginny all right?” Harry asked, shoving on his glasses.
“Mrs. Weasley’s patched her up,” said Hermione. “But now MadEye’s complaining that we can’t leave unless Sturgis Podmore’s here,
otherwise the guard will be one short.”
“Guard?” said Harry. “We have to go to King’s Cross with a guard?”
“You have to go to King’s Cross with a guard,” Hermione corrected
him.
“Why?” said Harry irritably. “I thought Voldemort was supposed
to be lying low, or are you telling me he’s going to jump out from
behind a dustbin to try and do me in?”
“I don’t know, it’s just what Mad-Eye says,” said Hermione
distractedly, looking at her watch. “But if we don’t leave soon we’re
definitely going to miss the train. . . .”
“WILL YOU LOT GET DOWN HERE NOW, PLEASE!” Mrs.
Weasley bellowed and Hermione jumped as though scalded and
hurried out of the room. Harry seized Hedwig, stuffed her unceremoniously into her cage, and set off downstairs after Hermione, dragging
his trunk.
Mrs. Black’s portrait was howling with rage but nobody was bothering to close the curtains over her; all the noise in the hall was bound
to rouse her again anyway.
“Harry, you’re to come with me and Tonks,” shouted Mrs. Weasley
over the repeated screeches of “MUDBLOODS ! SCUM ! CREATURES
OF DIRT !” “Leave your trunk and your owl, Alastor’s going to deal with
the luggage. . . . Oh, for heaven’s sake, Sirius, Dumbledore said no!”
A bearlike black dog had appeared at Harry’s side as Harry clam

LUNA LOVEGOOD
bered over the various trunks cluttering the hall to get to Mrs.
Weasley.
“Oh honestly . . .” said Mrs. Weasley despairingly, “well, on your
own head be it!”
She wrenched open the front door and stepped out into the weak
September sunlight. Harry and the dog followed her. The door
slammed behind them and Mrs. Black’s screeches were cut off
instantly.
“Where’s Tonks?” Harry said, looking around as they went down
the stone steps of number twelve, which vanished the moment they
reached the pavement.
“She’s waiting for us just up here,” said Mrs. Weasley stiffly, averting her eyes from the lolloping black dog beside Harry.
An old woman greeted them on the corner. She had tightly curled
gray hair and wore a purple hat shaped like a porkpie.
“Wotcher, Harry,” she said, winking. “Better hurry up, hadn’t we,
Molly?” she added, checking her watch.
“I know, I know,” moaned Mrs. Weasley, lengthening her stride,
“but Mad-Eye wanted to wait for Sturgis. . . . If only Arthur could
have got us cars from the Ministry again . . . but Fudge wouldn’t let
him borrow so much as an empty ink bottle these days. . . . How
Muggles can stand traveling without magic . . .”
But the great black dog gave a joyful bark and gamboled around
them, snapping at pigeons, and chasing its own tail. Harry couldn’t
help laughing. Sirius had been trapped inside for a very long time.
Mrs. Weasley pursed her lips in an almost Aunt Petunia-ish way.
It took them twenty minutes to reach King’s Cross by foot and
nothing more eventful happened during that time than Sirius scaring
a couple of cats for Harry’s entertainment. Once inside the station
they lingered casually beside the barrier between platforms nine and
ten until the coast was clear, then each of them leaned against it in

turn and fell easily through onto platform nine and three quarters,
where the Hogwarts Express stood belching sooty steam over a platform packed with departing students and their families. Harry inhaled
the familiar smell and felt his spirits soar. . . . He was really going
back. . . .
“I hope the others make it in time,” said Mrs. Weasley anxiously,
staring behind her at the wrought-iron arch spanning the platform,
through which new arrivals would come.
“Nice dog, Harry!” called a tall boy with dreadlocks.
“Thanks, Lee,” said Harry, grinning, as Sirius wagged his tail
frantically.
“Oh good,” said Mrs. Weasley, sounding relieved, “here’s Alastor
with the luggage, look . . .”
A porter’s cap pulled low over his mismatched eyes, Moody came
limping through the archway pushing a cart full of their trunks.
“All okay,” he muttered to Mrs. Weasley and Tonks. “Don’t think
we were followed. . . .”
Seconds later, Mr. Weasley emerged onto the platform with Ron
and Hermione. They had almost unloaded Moody’s luggage cart
when Fred, George, and Ginny turned up with Lupin.
“No trouble?” growled Moody.
“Nothing,” said Lupin.
“I’ll still be reporting Sturgis to Dumbledore,” said Moody. “That’s
the second time he’s not turned up in a week. Getting as unreliable as
Mundungus.”
“Well, look after yourselves,” said Lupin, shaking hands all round.
He reached Harry last and gave him a clap on the shoulder. “You too,
Harry. Be careful.”
“Yeah, keep your head down and your eyes peeled,” said Moody,
shaking Harry’s hand too. “And don’t forget, all of you — careful
what you put in writing. If in doubt, don’t put it in a letter at all.”

LUNA LOVEGOOD
“It’s been great meeting all of you,” said Tonks, hugging Hermione
and Ginny. “We’ll see you soon, I expect.”
A warning whistle sounded; the students still on the platform
started hurrying onto the train.
“Quick, quick,” said Mrs. Weasley distractedly, hugging them at random and catching Harry twice. “Write. . . . Be good. . . . If you’ve forgotten anything we’ll send it on. . . . Onto the train, now, hurry. . . .”
For one brief moment, the great black dog reared onto its hind legs
and placed its front paws on Harry’s shoulders, but Mrs. Weasley
shoved Harry away toward the train door hissing, “For heaven’s sake
act more like a dog, Sirius!”
“See you!” Harry called out of the open window as the train began
to move, while Ron, Hermione, and Ginny waved beside him. The
figures of Tonks, Lupin, Moody, and Mr. and Mrs. Weasley shrank
rapidly but the black dog was bounding alongside the window, wagging its tail; blurred people on the platform were laughing to see it
chasing the train, and then they turned the corner, and Sirius was
gone.
“He shouldn’t have come with us,” said Hermione in a worried
voice.
“Oh lighten up,” said Ron, “he hasn’t seen daylight for months,
poor bloke.”
“Well,” said Fred, clapping his hands together, “can’t stand around
chatting all day, we’ve got business to discuss with Lee. See you later,”
and he and George disappeared down the corridor to the right.
The train was gathering still more speed, so that the houses outside
the window flashed past and they swayed where they stood.
“Shall we go and find a compartment, then?” Harry asked Ron and
Hermione.
Ron and Hermione exchanged looks.
“Er,” said Ron.


183



CHAPTER TEN
“We’re — well — Ron and I are supposed to go into the prefect
carriage,” Hermione said awkwardly.
Ron wasn’t looking at Harry; he seemed to have become intensely
interested in the fingernails on his left hand.
“Oh,” said Harry. “Right. Fine.”
“I don’t think we’ll have to stay there all journey,” said Hermione
quickly. “Our letters said we just get instructions from the Head Boy
and Girl and then patrol the corridors from time to time.”
“Fine,” said Harry again. “Well, I-I might see you later, then.”
“Yeah, definitely,” said Ron, casting a shifty, anxious look at Harry.
“It’s a pain having to go down there, I’d rather — but we have to — I
mean, I’m not enjoying it, I’m not Percy,” he finished defiantly.
“I know you’re not,” said Harry and he grinned. But as Hermione
and Ron dragged their trunks, Crookshanks, and a caged Pigwidgeon
off toward the engine end of the train, Harry felt an odd sense of loss.
He had never traveled on the Hogwarts Express without Ron.
“Come on,” Ginny told him, “if we get a move on we’ll be able to
save them places.”
“Right,” said Harry, picking up Hedwig’s cage in one hand and the
handle of his trunk in the other. They struggled off down the corridor,
peering through the glass-paneled doors into the compartments they
passed, which were already full. Harry could not help noticing that a
lot of people stared back at him with great interest and that several of
them nudged their neighbors and pointed him out. After he had met
this behavior in five consecutive carriages he remembered that the
Daily Prophet had been telling its readers all summer what a lying
show-off he was. He wondered bleakly whether the people now staring and whispering believed the stories.
In the very last carriage they met Neville Longbottom, Harry’s fellow fifth-year Gryffindor, his round face shining with the effort of
pulling his trunk along and maintaining a one-handed grip on his
struggling toad, Trevor.


LUNA LOVEGOOD
“Hi, Harry,” he panted. “Hi, Ginny. . . . Everywhere’s full. . . . I
can’t find a seat. . . .”
“What are you talking about?” said Ginny, who had squeezed past
Neville to peer into the compartment behind him. “There’s room in
this one, there’s only Loony Lovegood in here —”
Neville mumbled something about not wanting to disturb anyone.
“Don’t be silly,” said Ginny, laughing, “she’s all right.”
She slid the door open and pulled her trunk inside it. Harry and
Neville followed.
“Hi, Luna,” said Ginny. “Is it okay if we take these seats?”
The girl beside the window looked up. She had straggly, waistlength, dirty-blond hair, very pale eyebrows, and protuberant eyes
that gave her a permanently surprised look. Harry knew at once why
Neville had chosen to pass this compartment by. The girl gave off an
aura of distinct dottiness. Perhaps it was the fact that she had stuck her
wand behind her left ear for safekeeping, or that she had chosen to
wear a necklace of butterbeer caps, or that she was reading a magazine
upside down. Her eyes ranged over Neville and came to rest on Harry.
She nodded.
“Thanks,” said Ginny, smiling at her.
Harry and Neville stowed the three trunks and Hedwig’s cage in
the luggage rack and sat down. The girl called Luna watched them
over her upside-down magazine, which was called The Quibbler. She
did not seem to need to blink as much as normal humans. She stared
and stared at Harry, who had taken the seat opposite her and now
wished he had not.
“Had a good summer, Luna?” Ginny asked.
“Yes,” said Luna dreamily, without taking her eyes off Harry. “Yes,
it was quite enjoyable, you know. You’re Harry Potter,” she added.
“I know I am,” said Harry.
Neville chuckled. Luna turned her pale eyes upon him instead.
“And I don’t know who you are.”


185

CHAPTER TEN
“I’m nobody,” said Neville hurriedly.
“No you’re not,” said Ginny sharply. “Neville Longbottom —
Luna Lovegood. Luna’s in my year, but in Ravenclaw.”
“Wit beyond measure is man’s greatest treasure,” said Luna in a
singsong voice.
She raised her upside-down magazine high enough to hide her face
and fell silent. Harry and Neville looked at each other with their eyebrows raised. Ginny suppressed a giggle.
The train rattled onward, speeding them out into open country. It
was an odd, unsettled sort of day; one moment the carriage was full of
sunlight and the next they were passing beneath ominously gray
clouds.
“Guess what I got for my birthday?” said Neville.
“Another Remembrall?” said Harry, remembering the marblelike
device Neville’s grandmother had sent him in an effort to improve his
abysmal memory.
“No,” said Neville, “I could do with one, though, I lost the old one
ages ago. . . . No, look at this. . . .”
He dug the hand that was not keeping a firm grip on Trevor into
his schoolbag and after a little bit of rummaging pulled out what appeared to be a small gray cactus in a pot, except that it was covered
with what looked like boils rather than spines.
“Mimbulus mimbletonia,” he said proudly.
Harry stared at the thing. It was pulsating slightly, giving it the
rather sinister look of some diseased internal organ.
“It’s really, really rare,” said Neville, beaming. “I don’t know if
there’s one in the greenhouse at Hogwarts, even. I can’t wait to show
it to Professor Sprout. My great-uncle Algie got it for me in Assyria.
I’m going to see if I can breed from it.”
Harry knew that Neville’s favorite subject was Herbology, but for
the life of him he could not see what he would want with this stunted
little plant.


186



LUNA LOVEGOOD
“Does it — er — do anything?” he asked.
“Loads of stuff!” said Neville proudly. “It’s got an amazing defensive mechanism — hold Trevor for me. . . .”
He dumped the toad into Harry’s lap and took a quill from his
schoolbag. Luna Lovegood’s popping eyes appeared over the top of
her upside-down magazine again, watching what Neville was doing.
Neville held the Mimbulus mimbletonia up to his eyes, his tongue between his teeth, chose his spot, and gave the plant a sharp prod with
the tip of his quill.
Liquid squirted from every boil on the plant, thick, stinking, darkgreen jets of it; they hit the ceiling, the windows, and spattered Luna
Lovegood’s magazine. Ginny, who had flung her arms up in front of
her face just in time, merely looked as though she was wearing a slimy
green hat, but Harry, whose hands had been busy preventing the escape of Trevor, received a face full. It smelled like rancid manure.
Neville, whose face and torso were also drenched, shook his head to
get the worst out of his eyes.
“S-sorry,” he gasped. “I haven’t tried that before. . . . Didn’t realize
it would be quite so . . . Don’t worry, though, Stinksap’s not poisonous,” he added nervously, as Harry spat a mouthful onto the floor.
At that precise moment the door of their compartment slid open.
“Oh . . . hello, Harry,” said a nervous voice. “Um . . . bad time?”
Harry wiped the lenses of his glasses with his Trevor-free hand. A
very pretty girl with long, shiny black hair was standing in the doorway
smiling at him: Cho Chang, the Seeker on the Ravenclaw Quidditch
team.
“Oh . . . hi,” said Harry blankly.
“Um . . .” said Cho. “Well . . . just thought I’d say hello . . . ’bye
then.”
She closed the door again, rather pink in the face, and departed.
Harry slumped back in his seat and groaned. He would have liked
Cho to discover him sitting with a group of very cool people laughing


their heads off at a joke he had just told; he would not have chosen to
be sitting with Neville and Loony Lovegood, clutching a toad and
dripping in Stinksap.
“Never mind,” said Ginny bracingly. “Look, we can get rid of all
this easily.” She pulled out her wand. “Scourgify!”
The Stinksap vanished.
“Sorry,” said Neville again, in a small voice.
Ron and Hermione did not turn up for nearly an hour, by which
time the food trolley had already gone by. Harry, Ginny, and Neville
had finished their Pumpkin Pasties and were busy swapping Chocolate Frog cards when the compartment door slid open and they
walked in, accompanied by Crookshanks and a shrilly hooting Pigwidgeon in his cage.
“I’m starving,” said Ron, stowing Pigwidgeon next to Hedwig,
grabbing a Chocolate Frog from Harry and throwing himself into the
seat next to him. He ripped open the wrapper, bit off the Frog’s head,
and leaned back with his eyes closed as though he had had a very exhausting morning.
“Well, there are two fifth-year prefects from each House,” said
Hermione, looking thoroughly disgruntled as she took her seat. “Boy
and girl from each.”
“And guess who’s a Slytherin prefect?” said Ron, still with his eyes
closed.
“Malfoy,” replied Harry at once, his worst fear confirmed.
“ ’Course,” said Ron bitterly, stuffing the rest of the Frog into his
mouth and taking another.
“And that complete cow Pansy Parkinson,” said Hermione viciously. “How she got to be a prefect when she’s thicker than a concussed
troll . . .”
“Who’s Hufflepuff?” Harry asked.
“Ernie Macmillan and Hannah Abbott,” said Ron thickly.

“And Anthony Goldstein and Padma Patil for Ravenclaw,” said
Hermione.
“You went to the Yule Ball with Padma Patil,” said a vague voice.
Everyone turned to look at Luna Lovegood, who was gazing unblinkingly at Ron over the top of The Quibbler. He swallowed his
mouthful of Frog.
“Yeah, I know I did,” he said, looking mildly surprised.
“She didn’t enjoy it very much,” Luna informed him. “She doesn’t
think you treated her very well, because you wouldn’t dance with her.
I don’t think I’d have minded,” she added thoughtfully, “I don’t like
dancing very much.”
She retreated behind The Quibbler again. Ron stared at the cover
with his mouth hanging open for a few seconds, then looked around
at Ginny for some kind of explanation, but Ginny had stuffed her
knuckles in her mouth to stop herself giggling. Ron shook his head,
bemused, then checked his watch.
“We’re supposed to patrol the corridors every so often,” he told
Harry and Neville, “and we can give out punishments if people are
misbehaving. I can’t wait to get Crabbe and Goyle for something. . . .”
“You’re not supposed to abuse your position, Ron!” said Hermione
sharply.
“Yeah, right, because Malfoy won’t abuse it at all,” said Ron
sarcastically.
“So you’re going to descend to his level?”
“No, I’m just going to make sure I get his mates before he gets
mine.”
“For heaven’s sake, Ron —”
“I’ll make Goyle do lines, it’ll kill him, he hates writing,” said Ron
happily. He lowered his voice to Goyle’s low grunt and, screwing up his
face in a look of pained concentration, mimed writing in midair. “I . . .
must . . . not . . . look . . . like . . . a . . . baboon’s . . . backside. . . .”

CHAPTER TEN
Everyone laughed, but nobody laughed harder than Luna Lovegood. She let out a scream of mirth that caused Hedwig to wake up
and flap her wings indignantly and Crookshanks to leap up into the
luggage rack, hissing. She laughed so hard that her magazine slipped
out of her grasp, slid down her legs, and onto the floor.
“That was funny!”
Her prominent eyes swam with tears as she gasped for breath, staring
at Ron. Utterly nonplussed, he looked around at the others, who were
now laughing at the expression on Ron’s face and at the ludicrously
prolonged laughter of Luna Lovegood, who was rocking backward and
forward, clutching her sides.
“Are you taking the mickey?” said Ron, frowning at her.
“Baboon’s . . . backside!” she choked, holding her ribs.
Everyone else was watching Luna laughing, but Harry, glancing at
the magazine on the floor, noticed something that made him dive for
it. Upside down it had been hard to tell what the picture on the front
was, but Harry now realized it was a fairly bad cartoon of Cornelius
Fudge; Harry only recognized him because of the lime-green bowler
hat. One of Fudge’s hands was clenched around a bag of gold; the
other hand was throttling a goblin. The cartoon was captioned: How
Far Will Fudge Go to Gain Gringotts?
Beneath this were listed the titles of other articles inside the magazine.
CORRUPTION IN THE QUIDDITCH LEAGUE:
How the Tornados Are Taking Control
SECRETS OF THE ANCIENT RUNES REVEALED
SIRIUS BLACK: Villain or Victim?

“Can I have a look at this?” Harry asked Luna eagerly.
She nodded, still gazing at Ron, breathless with laughter.


LUNA LOVEGOOD
Harry opened the magazine and scanned the index; until this moment he had completely forgotten the magazine Kingsley had handed
Mr. Weasley to give to Sirius, but it must have been this edition of The
Quibbler. He found the page and turned excitedly to the article.
This too was illustrated by a rather bad cartoon; in fact, Harry
would not have known it was supposed to be Sirius if it hadn’t been
captioned. Sirius was standing on a pile of human bones with his
wand out. The headline on the article read:
SIRIUS - Black As He’s Painted?
Notorious Mass Murderer OR Innocent Singing Sensation?

Harry had to read this sentence several times before he was convinced that he had not misunderstood it. Since when had Sirius been
a singing sensation?
For fourteen years Sirius Black has been believed
guilty of the mass murder of twelve innocent Muggles and one wizard. Black’s audacious escape from
Azkaban two years ago has led to the widest manhunt ever conducted by the Ministry of Magic. None
of us has ever questioned that he deserves to be recaptured and handed back to the dementors.
BUT DOES HE?
Startling new evidence has recently come to light
that Sirius Black may not have committed the crimes
for which he was sent to Azkaban. In fact, says Doris
Purkiss, of 18 Acanthia Way, Little Norton, Black may
not even have been present at the killings.
“What people don’t realize is that Sirius Black is
a false name,” says Mrs. Purkiss. “The man people


191



CHAPTER TEN
believe to be Sirius Black is actually Stubby Boardman, lead singer of the popular singing group The
Hobgoblins, who retired from public life after being
struck in the ear by a turnip at a concert in Little Norton Church Hall nearly fifteen years ago. I recognized
him the moment I saw his picture in the paper. Now,
Stubby couldn’t possibly have committed those
crimes, because on the day in question he happened
to be enjoying a romantic candlelit dinner with me. I
have written to the Minister of Magic and am expecting him to give Stubby, alias Sirius, a full pardon any
day now.”

Harry finished reading and stared at the page in disbelief. Perhaps
it was a joke, he thought, perhaps the magazine often printed spoof
items. He flicked back a few pages and found the piece on Fudge.
Cornelius Fudge, the Minister of Magic, denied that
he had any plans to take over the running of the Wizarding Bank, Gringotts, when he was elected Minister
of Magic five years ago. Fudge has always insisted
that he wants nothing more than to “cooperate
peacefully” with the guardians of our gold.
BUT DOES HE?
Sources close to the Minister have recently disclosed that Fudge’s dearest ambition is to seize
control of the goblin gold supplies and that he will
not hesitate to use force if need be.
“It wouldn’t be the first time, either,” said a
Ministry insider. “Cornelius ‘Goblin-Crusher’ Fudge,
that’s what his friends call him, if you could hear him


192



LUNA LOVEGOOD
when he thinks no one’s listening, oh, he’s always
talking about the goblins he’s had done in; he’s had
them drowned, he’s had them dropped off buildings,
he’s had them poisoned, he’s had them cooked in
pies. . . .”

Harry did not read any further. Fudge might have many faults but
Harry found it extremely hard to imagine him ordering goblins to be
cooked in pies. He flicked through the rest of the magazine. Pausing
every few pages he read an accusation that the Tutshill Tornados were
winning the Quidditch League by a combination of blackmail, illegal
broom-tampering, and torture; an interview with a wizard who
claimed to have flown to the moon on a Cleansweep Six and brought
back a bag of moon frogs to prove it; and an article on ancient runes,
which at least explained why Luna had been reading The Quibbler upside down. According to the magazine, if you turned the runes on
their heads they revealed a spell to make your enemy’s ears turn into
kumquats. In fact, compared to the rest of the articles in The Quibbler,
the suggestion that Sirius might really be the lead singer of The Hobgoblins was quite sensible.
“Anything good in there?” asked Ron as Harry closed the magazine.
“Of course not,” said Hermione scathingly, before Harry could answer, “The Quibbler’s rubbish, everyone knows that.”
“Excuse me,” said Luna; her voice had suddenly lost its dreamy
quality. “My father’s the editor.”
“I — oh,” said Hermione, looking embarrassed. “Well . . . it’s got
some interesting . . . I mean, it’s quite . . .”
“I’ll have it back, thank you,” said Luna coldly, and leaning forward
she snatched it out of Harry’s hands. Rifling through it to page fiftyseven, she turned it resolutely upside down again and disappeared
behind it, just as the compartment door opened for the third time.


CHAPTER TEN
Harry looked around; he had expected this, but that did not make the
sight of Draco Malfoy smirking at him from between his cronies
Crabbe and Goyle any more enjoyable.
“What?” he said aggressively, before Malfoy could open his mouth.
“Manners, Potter, or I’ll have to give you a detention,” drawled
Malfoy, whose sleek blond hair and pointed chin were just like his
father’s. “You see, I, unlike you, have been made a prefect, which
means that I, unlike you, have the power to hand out punishments.”
“Yeah,” said Harry, “but you, unlike me, are a git, so get out and
leave us alone.”
Ron, Hermione, Ginny, and Neville laughed. Malfoy’s lip curled.
“Tell me, how does it feel being second-best to Weasley, Potter?” he
asked.
“Shut up, Malfoy,” said Hermione sharply.
“I seem to have touched a nerve,” said Malfoy, smirking. “Well, just
watch yourself, Potter, because I’ll be dogging your footsteps in case
you step out of line.”
“Get out!” said Hermione, standing up.
Sniggering, Malfoy gave Harry a last malicious look and departed,
Crabbe and Goyle lumbering in his wake. Hermione slammed the
compartment door behind them and turned to look at Harry, who
knew at once that she, like him, had registered what Malfoy had said
and been just as unnerved by it.
“Chuck us another Frog,” said Ron, who had clearly noticed
nothing.
Harry could not talk freely in front of Neville and Luna. He exchanged another nervous look with Hermione and then stared out of
the window.
He had thought Sirius coming with him to the station was a bit of
a laugh, but suddenly it seemed reckless, if not downright dangerous.
. . . Hermione had been right. . . . Sirius should not have come. What
if Mr. Malfoy had noticed the black dog and told Draco, what if he


194



LUNA LOVEGOOD
had deduced that the Weasleys, Lupin, Tonks, and Moody knew
where Sirius was hiding? Or had Malfoy’s use of the word “dogging”
been a coincidence?
The weather remained undecided as they traveled farther and farther north. Rain spattered the windows in a halfhearted way, then the
sun put in a feeble appearance before clouds drifted over it once more.
When darkness fell and lamps came on inside the carriages, Luna
rolled up The Quibbler, put it carefully away in her bag, and took to
staring at everyone in the compartment instead.
Harry was sitting with his forehead pressed against the train window, trying to get a first distant glimpse of Hogwarts, but it was a
moonless night and the rain-streaked window was grimy.
“We’d better change,” said Hermione at last. She and Ron pinned
their prefect badges carefully to their chests. Harry saw Ron checking
how it looked in the black window.
At last the train began to slow down and they heard the usual racket
up and down it as everybody scrambled to get their luggage and pets
assembled, ready for departure. Ron and Hermione were supposed to
supervise all this; they disappeared from the carriage again, leaving
Harry and the others to look after Crookshanks and Pigwidgeon.
“I’ll carry that owl, if you like,” said Luna to Harry, reaching out
for Pigwidgeon as Neville stowed Trevor carefully in an inside pocket.
“Oh — er — thanks,” said Harry, handing her the cage and hoisting Hedwig’s more securely into his arms.
They shuffled out of the compartment feeling the first sting of the
night air on their faces as they joined the crowd in the corridor. Slowly
they moved toward the doors. Harry could smell the pine trees that
lined the path down to the lake. He stepped down onto the platform
and looked around, listening for the familiar call of “Firs’ years over
here . . . firs’ years . . .”
But it did not come. Instead a quite different voice, a brisk female


195



CHAPTER TEN
one, was calling, “First years line up over here, please! All first years to
me!”
A lantern came swinging toward Harry and by its light he saw the
prominent chin and severe haircut of Professor Grubbly-Plank, the
witch who had taken over Hagrid’s Care of Magical Creatures lessons
for a while the previous year.
“Where’s Hagrid?” he said out loud.
“I don’t know,” said Ginny, “but we’d better get out of the way,
we’re blocking the door.”
“Oh yeah . . .”
Harry and Ginny became separated as they moved off along the
platform and out through the station. Jostled by the crowd, Harry
squinted through the darkness for a glimpse of Hagrid; he had to be
here, Harry had been relying on it — seeing Hagrid again had been
one of the things to which he had been looking forward most. But
there was no sign of him at all.
He can’t have left, Harry told himself as he shuffled slowly through
a narrow doorway onto the road outside with the rest of the crowd.
He’s just got a cold or something. . . .
He looked around for Ron or Hermione, wanting to know what
they thought about the reappearance of Professor Grubbly-Plank, but
neither of them was anywhere near him, so he allowed himself to be
shunted forward onto the dark rain-washed road outside Hogsmeade
station.
Here stood the hundred or so horseless stagecoaches that always
took the students above first year up to the castle. Harry glanced
quickly at them, turned away to keep a lookout for Ron and
Hermione, then did a double take.
The coaches were no longer horseless. There were creatures standing between the carriage shafts; if he had had to give them a name, he
supposed he would have called them horses, though there was something reptilian about them, too. They were completely fleshless, their


196



LUNA LOVEGOOD
black coats clinging to their skeletons, of which every bone was visible. Their heads were dragonish, and their pupil-less eyes white and
staring. Wings sprouted from each wither — vast, black leathery
wings that looked as though they ought to belong to giant bats.
Standing still and quiet in the gloom, the creatures looked eerie and
sinister. Harry could not understand why the coaches were being
pulled by these horrible horses when they were quite capable of
moving along by themselves.
“Where’s Pig?” said Ron’s voice, right behind Harry.
“That Luna girl was carrying him,” said Harry, turning quickly, eager to consult Ron about Hagrid. “Where d’you reckon —”
“— Hagrid is? I dunno,” said Ron, sounding worried. “He’d better
be okay. . . .”
A short distance away, Draco Malfoy, followed by a small gang of
cronies including Crabbe, Goyle, and Pansy Parkinson, was pushing
some timid-looking second years out of the way so that they could get
a coach to themselves. Seconds later Hermione emerged panting from
the crowd.
“Malfoy was being absolutely foul to a first year back there, I swear
I’m going to report him, he’s only had his badge three minutes and he’s
using it to bully people worse than ever. . . . Where’s Crookshanks?”
“Ginny’s got him,” said Harry. “There she is. . . .”
Ginny had just emerged from the crowd, clutching a squirming
Crookshanks.
“Thanks,” said Hermione, relieving Ginny of the cat. “Come on,
let’s get a carriage together before they all fill up. . . .”
“I haven’t got Pig yet!” Ron said, but Hermione was already heading off toward the nearest unoccupied coach. Harry remained behind
with Ron.
“What are those things, d’you reckon?” he asked Ron, nodding at
the horrible horses as the other students surged past them.
“What things?”


197

CHAPTER TEN
“Those horse —”
Luna appeared holding Pigwidgeon’s cage in her arms; the tiny owl
was twittering excitedly as usual.
“Here you are,” she said. “He’s a sweet little owl, isn’t he?”
“Er . . . yeah . . . He’s all right,” said Ron gruffly. “Well, come on
then, let’s get in. . . . what were you saying, Harry?”
“I was saying, what are those horse things?” Harry said, as he, Ron,
and Luna made for the carriage in which Hermione and Ginny were
already sitting.
“What horse things?”
“The horse things pulling the carriages!” said Harry impatiently;
they were, after all, about three feet from the nearest one; it was
watching them with empty white eyes. Ron, however, gave Harry a
perplexed look.
“What are you talking about?”
“I’m talking about — look!”
Harry grabbed Ron’s arm and wheeled him about so that he was
face-to-face with the winged horse. Ron stared straight at it for a second, then looked back at Harry.
“What am I supposed to be looking at?”
“At the — there, between the shafts! Harnessed to the coach! It’s
right there in front —”
But as Ron continued to look bemused, a strange thought occurred
to Harry.
“Can’t . . . can’t you see them?”
“See what?”
“Can’t you see what’s pulling the carriages?”
Ron looked seriously alarmed now.
“Are you feeling all right, Harry?”
“I . . . yeah . . .”
Harry felt utterly bewildered. The horse was there in front of him,
gleaming solidly in the dim light issuing from the station windows


LUNA LOVEGOOD
behind them, vapor rising from its nostrils in the chilly night air. Yet
unless Ron was faking — and it was a very feeble joke if he was —
Ron could not see it at all.
“Shall we get in, then?” said Ron uncertainly, looking at Harry as
though worried about him.
“Yeah,” said Harry. “Yeah, go on . . .”
“It’s all right,” said a dreamy voice from beside Harry as Ron vanished into the coach’s dark interior. “You’re not going mad or anything.
I can see them too.”
“Can you?” said Harry desperately, turning to Luna. He could see
the bat-winged horses reflected in her wide, silvery eyes.
“Oh yes,” said Luna, “I’ve been able to see them ever since my first
day here. They’ve always pulled the carriages. Don’t worry. You’re just
as sane as I am.”
Smiling faintly, she climbed into the musty interior of the carriage
after Ron. Not altogether reassured, Harry followed her.

H

arry did not want to tell the others that he and Luna were
having the same hallucination, if that was what it was, so he
said nothing about the horses as he sat down inside the carriage and
slammed the door behind him. Nevertheless, he could not help
watching the silhouettes of the horses moving beyond the window.
“Did everyone see that Grubbly-Plank woman?” asked Ginny.
“What’s she doing back here? Hagrid can’t have left, can he?”
“I’ll be quite glad if he has,” said Luna. “He isn’t a very good
teacher, is he?”
“Yes, he is!” said Harry, Ron, and Ginny angrily.
Harry glared at Hermione; she cleared her throat and quickly said,
“Erm . . . yes . . . he’s very good.”
“Well, we think he’s a bit of a joke in Ravenclaw,” said Luna,
unfazed.
“You’ve got a rubbish sense of humor then,” Ron snapped, as the
wheels below them creaked into motion.
Luna did not seem perturbed by Ron’s rudeness; on the contrary,


200



THE SORTING HAT’S
NEW SONG
she simply watched him for a while as though he were a mildly interesting television program.
Rattling and swaying, the carriages moved in convoy up the road.
When they passed between the tall stone pillars topped with winged
boars on either side of the gates to the school grounds, Harry leaned
forward to try and see whether there were any lights on in Hagrid’s
cabin by the Forbidden Forest, but the grounds were in complete
darkness. Hogwarts Castle, however, loomed ever closer: a towering
mass of turrets, jet-black against the dark sky, here and there a window
blazing fiery bright above them.
The carriages jingled to a halt near the stone steps leading up to the
oak front doors and Harry got out of the carriage first. He turned
again to look for lit windows down by the forest, but there was definitely no sign of life within Hagrid’s cabin. Unwillingly, because he
had half hoped they would have vanished, he turned his eyes instead
upon the strange, skeletal creatures standing quietly in the chill night
air, their blank white eyes gleaming.
Harry had once before had the experience of seeing something that
Ron could not, but that had been a reflection in a mirror, something
much more insubstantial than a hundred very solid-looking beasts
strong enough to pull a fleet of carriages. If Luna was to be believed,
the beasts had always been there but invisible; why, then, could Harry
suddenly see them, and why could Ron not?
“Are you coming or what?” said Ron beside him.
“Oh . . . yeah,” said Harry quickly, and they joined the crowd hurrying up the stone steps into the castle.
The entrance hall was ablaze with torches and echoing with footsteps as the students crossed the flagged stone floor for the double
doors to the right, leading to the Great Hall and the start-of-term
feast.
The four long House tables in the Great Hall were filling up under


201



CHAPTER ELEVEN
the starless black ceiling, which was just like the sky they could
glimpse through the high windows. Candles floated in midair all
along the tables, illuminating the silvery ghosts who were dotted
about the Hall and the faces of the students talking eagerly to one another, exchanging summer news, shouting greetings at friends from
other Houses, eyeing one another’s new haircuts and robes. Again
Harry noticed people putting their heads together to whisper as he
passed; he gritted his teeth and tried to act as though he neither noticed nor cared.
Luna drifted away from them at the Ravenclaw table. The moment
they reached Gryffindor’s, Ginny was hailed by some fellow fourth
years and left to sit with them; Harry, Ron, Hermione, and Neville
found seats together about halfway down the table between Nearly
Headless Nick, the Gryffindor House ghost, and Parvati Patil and
Lavender Brown, the last two of whom gave Harry airy, overly
friendly greetings that made him quite sure they had stopped talking
about him a split second before. He had more important things to
worry about, however: He was looking over the students’ heads to the
staff table that ran along the top wall of the Hall.
“He’s not there.”
Ron and Hermione scanned the staff table too, though there was
no real need; Hagrid’s size made him instantly obvious in any lineup.
“He can’t have left,” said Ron, sounding slightly anxious.
“Of course he hasn’t,” said Harry firmly.
“You don’t think he’s . . . hurt, or anything, do you?” said Hermione
uneasily.
“No,” said Harry at once.
“But where is he, then?”
There was a pause, then Harry said very quietly, so that Neville,
Parvati, and Lavender could not hear, “Maybe he’s not back yet. You
know — from his mission — the thing he was doing over the summer for Dumbledore.”


202

THE SORTING HAT’S
NEW SONG
“Yeah . . . yeah, that’ll be it,” said Ron, sounding reassured, but
Hermione bit her lip, looking up and down the staff table as though
hoping for some conclusive explanation of Hagrid’s absence.
“Who’s that?” she said sharply, pointing toward the middle of the
staff table.
Harry’s eyes followed hers. They lit first upon Professor Dumbledore, sitting in his high-backed golden chair at the center of the long
staff table, wearing deep-purple robes scattered with silvery stars and
a matching hat. Dumbledore’s head was inclined toward the woman
sitting next to him, who was talking into his ear. She looked, Harry
thought, like somebody’s maiden aunt: squat, with short, curly,
mouse-brown hair in which she had placed a horrible pink Alice band
that matched the fluffy pink cardigan she wore over her robes. Then
she turned her face slightly to take a sip from her goblet and he saw,
with a shock of recognition, a pallid, toadlike face and a pair of prominent, pouchy eyes.
“It’s that Umbridge woman!”
“Who?” said Hermione.
“She was at my hearing, she works for Fudge!”
“Nice cardigan,” said Ron, smirking.
“She works for Fudge?” Hermione repeated, frowning. “What on
earth’s she doing here, then?”
“Dunno . . .”
Hermione scanned the staff table, her eyes narrowed.
“No,” she muttered, “no, surely not . . .”
Harry did not understand what she was talking about but did not
ask; his attention had just been caught by Professor Grubbly-Plank
who had just appeared behind the staff table; she worked her way
along to the very end and took the seat that ought to have been Hagrid’s. That meant that the first years must have crossed the lake and
reached the castle, and sure enough, a few seconds later, the doors
from the entrance hall opened. A long line of scared-looking first years


203



CHAPTER ELEVEN
entered, led by Professor McGonagall, who was carrying a stool on
which sat an ancient wizard’s hat, heavily patched and darned with a
wide rip near the frayed brim.
The buzz of talk in the Great Hall faded away. The first years lined
up in front of the staff table facing the rest of the students, and Professor McGonagall placed the stool carefully in front of them, then
stood back.
The first years’ faces glowed palely in the candlelight. A small boy
right in the middle of the row looked as though he was trembling.
Harry recalled, fleetingly, how terrified he had felt when he had stood
there, waiting for the unknown test that would determine to which
House he belonged.
The whole school waited with bated breath. Then the rip near the
hat’s brim opened wide like a mouth and the Sorting Hat burst into
song:
In times of old when I was new
And Hogwarts barely started
The founders of our noble school
Thought never to be parted:
United by a common goal,
They had the selfsame yearning,
To make the world’s best magic school
And pass along their learning.
“Together we will build and teach!”
The four good friends decided
And never did they dream that they
Might someday be divided,
For were there such friends anywhere
As Slytherin and Gryffndor?
Unless it was the second pair
Of Huffepuff and Ravenclaw?


204



THE SORTING HAT’S
NEW SONG
So how could it have gone so wrong?
How could such friendships fail?
Why, I was there and so can tell
The whole sad, sorry tale.
Said Slytherin, “We’ll teach just those
Whose ancestry is purest.”
Said Ravenclaw, “We’ll teach those whose
Intelligence is surest.”
Said Gryffindor, “We’ll teach all those
With brave deeds to their name,”
Said Hufflepujf, “I’ll teach the lot,
And treat them just the same.”
These differences caused little strife
When first they came to light,
For each of the four founders had
A House in which they might
Take only those they wanted, so,
For instance, Slytherin
Took only pure-blood wizards
Of great cunning, just like him,
And only those of sharpest mind
Were taught by Ravenclaw
While the bravest and the boldest
Went to daring Gryffindor.
Good Hufflepujf she took the rest,
And taught them all she knew,
Thus the Houses and their founders
Retained friendships firm and true.
So Hogwarts worked in harmony
For several happy years,
But then discord crept among us
Feeding on our faults and fears.


205



CHAPTER ELEVEN
The Houses that, like pillars four,
Had once held up our school,
Now turned upon each other and,
Divided, sought to rule.
And for a while it seemed the school
Must meet an early end,
What with dueling and with fighting
And the clash of friend on friend
And at last there came a morning
When old Slytherin departed
And though the fighting then died out
He left us quite downhearted.
And never since the founders four
Were whittled down to three
Have the Houses been united
As they once were meant to be.
And now the Sorting Hat is here
And you all know the score:
I sort you into Houses
Because that is what I’m for,
But this year I’ll go further,
Listen closely to my song:
Though condemned I am to split you
Still I worry that it’s wrong,
Though I must fulfill my duty
And must quarter every year
Still I wonder whether sorting
May not bring the end I fear.
Oh, know the perils, read the signs,
The warning history shows,
For our Hogwarts is in danger
From external, deadly foes


206



THE SORTING HAT’S
NEW SONG
And we must unite inside her
Or we’ll crumble from within.
I have told you, I have warned you. . . .
Let the Sorting now begin.
The hat became motionless once more; applause broke out, though
it was punctured, for the first time in Harry’s memory, with muttering and whispers. All across the Great Hall students were exchanging
remarks with their neighbors and Harry, clapping along with everyone else, knew exactly what they were talking about.
“Branched out a bit this year, hasn’t it?” said Ron, his eyebrows
raised.
“Too right it has,” said Harry.
The Sorting Hat usually confined itself to describing the different
qualities looked for by each of the four Hogwarts Houses and its own
role in sorting them; Harry could not remember it ever trying to give
the school advice before.
“I wonder if it’s ever given warnings before?” said Hermione,
sounding slightly anxious.
“Yes, indeed,” said Nearly Headless Nick knowledgeably, leaning
across Neville toward her (Neville winced, it was very uncomfortable
to have a ghost lean through you). “The hat feels itself honor-bound
to give the school due warning whenever it feels —”
But Professor McGonagall, who was waiting to read out the list of
first years’ names, was giving the whispering students the sort of look
that scorches. Nearly Headless Nick placed a see-through finger to his
lips and sat primly upright again as the muttering came to an abrupt
end. With a last frowning look that swept the four House tables, Professor McGonagall lowered her eyes to her long piece of parchment
and called out,
“Abercrombie, Euan.”
The terrified-looking boy Harry had noticed earlier stumbled


CHAPTER ELEVEN
forward and put the hat on his head; it was only prevented from
falling right down to his shoulders by his very prominent ears. The hat
considered for a moment, then the rip near the brim opened again
and shouted, “GRYFFINDOR !”
Harry clapped loudly with the rest of Gryffindor House as Euan
Abercrombie staggered to their table and sat down, looking as though
he would like very much to sink through the floor and never be
looked at again.
Slowly the long line of first years thinned; in the pauses between
the names and the Sorting Hat’s decisions, Harry could hear Ron’s
stomach rumbling loudly. Finally, “Zeller, Rose” was sorted into Hufflepuff, and Professor McGonagall picked up the hat and stool and
marched them away as Professor Dumbledore rose to his feet.
Harry was somehow soothed to see Dumbledore standing before
them all, whatever his recent bitter feelings toward his headmaster.
Between the absence of Hagrid and the presence of those dragonish
horses, he had felt that his return to Hogwarts, so long anticipated,
was full of unexpected surprises like jarring notes in a familiar song.
But this, at least, was how it was supposed to be: their headmaster rising to greet them all before the start-of-term feast.
“To our newcomers,” said Dumbledore in a ringing voice, his arms
stretched wide and a beaming smile on his lips, “welcome! To our old
hands — welcome back! There is a time for speech making, but this is
not it. Tuck in!”
There was an appreciative laugh and an outbreak of applause as Dumbledore sat down neatly and threw his long beard over his shoulder so as
to keep it out of the way of his plate — for food had appeared out of
nowhere, so that the five long tables were groaning under joints and pies
and dishes of vegetables, bread, sauces, and flagons of pumpkin juice.
“Excellent,” said Ron, with a kind of groan of longing, and he
seized the nearest plate of chops and began piling them onto his plate,
watched wistfully by Nearly Headless Nick.

THE SORTING HAT’S
NEW SONG
“What were you saying before the Sorting?” Hermione asked the
ghost. “About the hat giving warnings?”
“Oh yes,” said Nick, who seemed glad of a reason to turn away
from Ron, who was now eating roast potatoes with almost indecent
enthusiasm. “Yes, I have heard the hat give several warnings before,
always at times when it detects periods of great danger for the school.
And always, of course, its advice is the same: Stand together, be strong
from within.”
“Ow kunnit nofe skusin danger ifzat?” said Ron.
His mouth was so full Harry thought it was quite an achievement
for him to make any noise at all.
“I beg your pardon?” said Nearly Headless Nick politely, while
Hermione looked revolted. Ron gave an enormous swallow and said,
“How can it know if the school’s in danger if it’s a hat?”
“I have no idea,” said Nearly Headless Nick. “Of course, it lives in
Dumbledore’s office, so I daresay it picks things up there.”
“And it wants all the Houses to be friends?” said Harry, looking
over at the Slytherin table, where Draco Malfoy was holding court.
“Fat chance.”
“Well, now, you shouldn’t take that attitude,” said Nick reprovingly.
“Peaceful cooperation, that’s the key. We ghosts, though we belong to
separate Houses, maintain links of friendship. In spite of the competitiveness between Gryffindor and Slytherin, I would never dream of
seeking an argument with the Bloody Baron.”
“Only because you’re terrified of him,” said Ron.
Nearly Headless Nick looked highly affronted.
“Terrified? I hope I, Sir Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington, have never
been guilty of cowardice in my life! The noble blood that runs in my
veins —”
“What blood?” asked Ron. “Surely you haven’t still got — ?”
“It’s a figure of speech!” said Nearly Headless Nick, now so annoyed
his head was trembling ominously on his partially severed neck. “I

CHAPTER ELEVEN
assume I am still allowed to enjoy the use of whichever words I like,
even if the pleasures of eating and drinking are denied me! But I am
quite used to students poking fun at my death, I assure you!”
“Nick, he wasn’t really laughing at you!” said Hermione, throwing
a furious look at Ron.
Unfortunately, Ron’s mouth was packed to exploding point again
and all he could manage was “node iddum eentup sechew,” which
Nick did not seem to think constituted an adequate apology. Rising
into the air, he straightened his feathered hat and swept away from
them to the other end of the table, coming to rest between the
Creevey brothers, Colin and Dennis.
“Well done, Ron,” snapped Hermione.
“What?” said Ron indignantly, having managed, finally, to swallow
his food. “I’m not allowed to ask a simple question?”
“Oh forget it,” said Hermione irritably, and the pair of them spent
the rest of the meal in huffy silence.
Harry was too used to their bickering to bother trying to reconcile
them; he felt it was a better use of his time to eat his way steadily
through his steak-and-kidney pie, then a large plateful of his favorite
treacle tart.
When all the students had finished eating and the noise level in the
hall was starting to creep upward again, Dumbledore got to his feet
once more. Talking ceased immediately as all turned to face the headmaster. Harry was feeling pleasantly drowsy now. His four-poster bed
was waiting somewhere above, wonderfully warm and soft. . . .
“Well, now that we are all digesting another magnificent feast, I beg
a few moments of your attention for the usual start-of-term notices,”
said Dumbledore. “First years ought to know that the forest in the
grounds is out of bounds to students — and a few of our older students
ought to know by now too.” (Harry, Ron, and Hermione exchanged
smirks.)

“Mr. Filch, the caretaker, has asked me, for what he tells me is the
four hundred and sixty-second time, to remind you all that magic is
not permitted in corridors between classes, nor are a number of other
things, all of which can be checked on the extensive list now fastened
to Mr. Filch’s office door.
“We have had two changes in staffing this year. We are very pleased
to welcome back Professor Grubbly-Plank, who will be taking Care of
Magical Creatures lessons; we are also delighted to introduce Professor Umbridge, our new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher.”
There was a round of polite but fairly unenthusiastic applause during which Harry, Ron, and Hermione exchanged slightly panicked
looks; Dumbledore had not said for how long Grubbly-Plank would
be teaching.
Dumbledore continued, “Tryouts for the House Quidditch teams
will take place on the —”
He broke off, looking inquiringly at Professor Umbridge. As she
was not much taller standing than sitting, there was a moment when
nobody understood why Dumbledore had stopped talking, but then
Professor Umbridge said, “Hem, hem,” and it became clear that she
had got to her feet and was intending to make a speech.
Dumbledore only looked taken aback for a moment, then he sat
back down smartly and looked alertly at Professor Umbridge as
though he desired nothing better than to listen to her talk. Other
members of staff were not as adept at hiding their surprise. Professor
Sprout’s eyebrows had disappeared into her flyaway hair, and Professor McGonagall’s mouth was as thin as Harry had ever seen it. No
new teacher had ever interrupted Dumbledore before. Many of the
students were smirking; this woman obviously did not know how
things were done at Hogwarts.
“Thank you, Headmaster,” Professor Umbridge simpered, “for
those kind words of welcome.”

CHAPTER ELEVEN
Her voice was high-pitched, breathy, and little-girlish and again,
Harry felt a powerful rush of dislike that he could not explain to himself; all he knew was that he loathed everything about her, from her
stupid voice to her fluffy pink cardigan. She gave another little throatclearing cough (“Hem, hem”) and continued: “Well, it is lovely to be
back at Hogwarts, I must say!” She smiled, revealing very pointed
teeth. “And to see such happy little faces looking back at me!”
Harry glanced around. None of the faces he could see looked
happy; on the contrary, they all looked rather taken aback at being
addressed as though they were five years old.
“I am very much looking forward to getting to know you all, and
I’m sure we’ll be very good friends!”
Students exchanged looks at this; some of them were barely concealing grins.
“I’ll be her friend as long as I don’t have to borrow that cardigan,”
Parvati whispered to Lavender, and both of them lapsed into silent
giggles.
Professor Umbridge cleared her throat again (“Hem, hem”), but
when she continued, some of the breathiness had vanished from her
voice. She sounded much more businesslike and now her words had a
dull learned-by-heart sound to them.
“The Ministry of Magic has always considered the education of
young witches and wizards to be of vital importance. The rare gifts
with which you were born may come to nothing if not nurtured and
honed by careful instruction. The ancient skills unique to the Wizarding community must be passed down through the generations lest
we lose them forever. The treasure trove of magical knowledge
amassed by our ancestors must be guarded, replenished, and polished
by those who have been called to the noble profession of teaching.”
Professor Umbridge paused here and made a little bow to her
fellow staff members, none of whom bowed back. Professor McGonagall’s dark eyebrows had contracted so that she looked positively


THE SORTING HAT’S
NEW SONG
hawklike, and Harry distinctly saw her exchange a significant glance
with Professor Sprout as Umbridge gave another little “Hem, hem” and
went on with her speech.
“Every headmaster and headmistress of Hogwarts has brought
something new to the weighty task of governing this historic school,
and that is as it should be, for without progress there will be stagnation
and decay. There again, progress for progress’s sake must be discouraged, for our tried and tested traditions often require no tinkering. A
balance, then, between old and new, between permanence and change,
between tradition and innovation . . .”
Harry found his attentiveness ebbing, as though his brain was slipping in and out of tune. The quiet that always filled the Hall when
Dumbledore was speaking was breaking up as students put their heads
together, whispering and giggling. Over at the Ravenclaw table, Cho
Chang was chatting animatedly with her friends. A few seats along
from Cho, Luna Lovegood had got out The Quibbler again. Meanwhile at the Hufflepuff table, Ernie Macmillan was one of the few still
staring at Professor Umbridge, but he was glassy-eyed and Harry was
sure he was only pretending to listen in an attempt to live up to the
new prefect’s badge gleaming on his chest.
Professor Umbridge did not seem to notice the restlessness of her
audience. Harry had the impression that a full-scale riot could have
broken out under her nose and she would have plowed on with her
speech. The teachers, however, were still listening very attentively, and
Hermione seemed to be drinking in every word Umbridge spoke,
though judging by her expression, they were not at all to her taste.
“. . . because some changes will be for the better, while others will
come, in the fullness of time, to be recognized as errors of judgment.
Meanwhile, some old habits will be retained, and rightly so, whereas
others, outmoded and outworn, must be abandoned. Let us move
forward, then, into a new era of openness, effectiveness, and accountability, intent on preserving what ought to be preserved, perfecting

what needs to be perfected, and pruning wherever we find practices
that ought to be prohibited.”
She sat down. Dumbledore clapped. The staff followed his lead,
though Harry noticed that several of them brought their hands together only once or twice before stopping. A few students joined in,
but most had been taken unawares by the end of the speech, not having listened to more than a few words of it, and before they could start
applauding properly, Dumbledore had stood up again.
“Thank you very much, Professor Umbridge, that was most illuminating,” he said, bowing to her. “Now — as I was saying, Quidditch
tryouts will be held . . .”
“Yes, it certainly was illuminating,” said Hermione in a low voice.
“You’re not telling me you enjoyed it?” Ron said quietly, turning a
glazed face upon Hermione. “That was about the dullest speech I’ve
ever heard, and I grew up with Percy.”
“I said illuminating, not enjoyable,” said Hermione. “It explained
a lot.”
“Did it?” said Harry in surprise. “Sounded like a load of waffle to me.”
“There was some important stuff hidden in the waffle,” said Hermione grimly.
“Was there?” said Ron blankly.
“How about ‘progress for progress’s sake must be discouraged’? How
about ‘pruning wherever we find practices that ought to be prohibited’?”
“Well, what does that mean?” said Ron impatiently.
“I’ll tell you what it means,” said Hermione ominously. “It means
the Ministry’s interfering at Hogwarts.”
There was a great clattering and banging all around them; Dumbledore had obviously just dismissed the school, because everyone was
standing up ready to leave the Hall. Hermione jumped up, looking
flustered.
“Ron, we’re supposed to show the first years where to go!”


214

THE SORTING HAT’S

“Oh yeah,” said Ron, who had obviously forgotten. “Hey — hey
you lot! Midgets!”
“Ron!”
“Well, they are, they’re titchy. . . .”
“I know, but you can’t call them midgets. . . . First years!” Hermione
called commandingly along the table. “This way, please!”
A group of new students walked shyly up the gap between the
Gryffindor and Hufflepuff tables, all of them trying hard not to lead
the group. They did indeed seem very small; Harry was sure he had
not appeared that young when he had arrived here. He grinned at
them. A blond boy next to Euan Abercrombie looked petrified,
nudged Euan, and whispered something in his ear. Euan Abercrombie
looked equally frightened and stole a horrified look at Harry, who felt
the grin slide off his face like Stinksap.
“See you later,” he said to Ron and Hermione and he made his way
out of the Great Hall alone, doing everything he could to ignore more
whispering, staring, and pointing as he passed. He kept his eyes fixed
ahead as he wove his way through the crowd in the entrance hall, then
he hurried up the marble staircase, took a couple of concealed shortcuts, and had soon left most of the crowds behind.
He had been stupid not to expect this, he thought angrily, as he
walked through much emptier upstairs corridors. Of course everyone
was staring at him: He had emerged from the Triwizard maze two
months ago clutching the dead body of a fellow student and claiming
to have seen Lord Voldemort return to power. There had not been
time last term to explain himself before everyone went home, even if
he had felt up to giving the whole school a detailed account of the terrible events in that graveyard.
He had reached the end of the corridor to the Gryffindor common
room and had come to a halt in front of the portrait of the Fat Lady
before he realized that he did not know the new password.


215



CHAPTER ELEVEN
“Er . . .” he said glumly, staring up at the Fat Lady, who smoothed
the folds of her pink satin dress and looked sternly back at him.
“No password, no entrance,” she said loftily.
“Harry, I know it!” someone panted from behind him, and he
turned to see Neville jogging toward him. “Guess what it is? I’m actually going to be able to remember it for once —” He waved the
stunted little cactus he had shown them on the train. “Mimbulus
mimbletonia!”
“Correct,” said the Fat Lady, and her portrait swung open toward
them like a door, revealing a circular hole in the wall behind, through
which Harry and Neville now climbed.
The Gryffindor common room looked as welcoming as ever, a cozy
circular tower room full of dilapidated squashy armchairs and rickety
old tables. A fire was crackling merrily in the grate and a few people
were warming their hands before going up to their dormitories; on the
other side of the room Fred and George Weasley were pinning something up on the notice board. Harry waved good night to them and
headed straight for the door to the boys’ dormitories; he was not in
much of a mood for talking at the moment. Neville followed him.
Dean Thomas and Seamus Finnigan had reached the dormitory
first and were in the process of covering the walls beside their beds
with posters and photographs. They had been talking as Harry
pushed open the door but stopped abruptly the moment they saw
him. Harry wondered whether they had been talking about him, then
whether he was being paranoid.
“Hi,” he said, moving across to his own trunk and opening it.
“Hey, Harry,” said Dean, who was putting on a pair of pajamas in
the West Ham colors. “Good holiday?”
“Not bad,” muttered Harry, as a true account of his holiday would
have taken most of the night to relate and he could not face it. “You?”
“Yeah, it was okay,” chuckled Dean. “Better than Seamus’s anyway,
he was just telling me.”


THE SORTING HAT’S

“Why, what happened, Seamus?” Neville asked as he placed his
Mimbulus mimbletonia tenderly on his bedside cabinet.
Seamus did not answer immediately; he was making rather a meal
of ensuring that his poster of the Kenmare Kestrels Quidditch team
was quite straight. Then he said, with his back still turned to Harry,
“Me mam didn’t want me to come back.”
“What?” said Harry, pausing in the act of pulling off his robes.
“She didn’t want me to come back to Hogwarts.”
Seamus turned away from his poster and pulled his own pajamas
out of his trunk, still not looking at Harry.
“But — why?” said Harry, astonished. He knew that Seamus’s
mother was a witch and could not understand, therefore, why she
should have come over so Dursley-ish.
Seamus did not answer until he had finished buttoning his pajamas.
“Well,” he said in a measured voice, “I suppose . . . because of you.”
“What d’you mean?” said Harry quickly. His heart was beating
rather fast. He felt vaguely as though something was closing in on him.
“Well,” said Seamus again, still avoiding Harry’s eyes, “she . . . er
. . . well, it’s not just you, it’s Dumbledore too . . .”
“She believes the Daily Prophet?” said Harry. “She thinks I’m a liar
and Dumbledore’s an old fool?”
Seamus looked up at him. “Yeah, something like that.”
Harry said nothing. He threw his wand down onto his bedside
table, pulled off his robes, stuffed them angrily into his trunk, and
pulled on his pajamas. He was sick of it; sick of being the person who
was stared at and talked about all the time. If any of them knew, if any
of them had the faintest idea what it felt like to be the one all these
things had happened to . . . Mrs. Finnigan had no idea, the stupid
woman, he thought savagely.
He got into bed and made to pull the hangings closed around him,
but before he could do so, Seamus said, “Look . . . what did happen
that night when . . . you know, when . . . with Cedric Diggory and all?”


217

CHAPTER ELEVEN
Seamus sounded nervous and eager at the same time. Dean, who
had been bending over his trunk, trying to retrieve a slipper, went
oddly still and Harry knew he was listening hard.
“What are you asking me for?” Harry retorted. “Just read the Daily
Prophet like your mother, why don’t you? That’ll tell you all you need
to know.”
“Don’t you have a go at my mother,” snapped Seamus.
“I’ll have a go at anyone who calls me a liar,” said Harry.
“Don’t talk to me like that!”
“I’ll talk to you how I want,” said Harry, his temper rising so fast he
snatched his wand back from his bedside table. “If you’ve got a problem sharing a dormitory with me, go and ask McGonagall if you can
be moved, stop your mummy worrying —”
“Leave my mother out of this, Potter!”
“What’s going on?”
Ron had appeared in the doorway. His wide eyes traveled from
Harry, who was kneeling on his bed with his wand pointing at Seamus, to Seamus, who was standing there with his fists raised.
“He’s having a go at my mother!” Seamus yelled.
“What?” said Ron. “Harry wouldn’t do that — we met your mother,
we liked her. . . .”
“That’s before she started believing every word the stinking Daily
Prophet writes about me!” said Harry at the top of his voice.
“Oh,” said Ron, comprehension dawning across his freckled face.
“Oh . . . right.”
“You know what?” said Seamus heatedly, casting Harry a venomous
look. “He’s right, I don’t want to share a dormitory with him anymore, he’s a madman.”
“That’s out of order, Seamus,” said Ron, whose ears were starting to
glow red, always a danger sign.
“Out of order, am I?” shouted Seamus, who in contrast with Ron

was turning paler. “You believe all the rubbish he’s come out with
about You-Know-Who, do you, you reckon he’s telling the truth?”
“Yeah, I do!” said Ron angrily.
“Then you’re mad too,” said Seamus in disgust.
“Yeah? Well unfortunately for you, pal, I’m also a prefect!” said
Ron, jabbing himself in the chest with a finger. “So unless you want
detention, watch your mouth!”
Seamus looked for a few seconds as though detention would be a
reasonable price to pay to say what was going through his mind; but
with a noise of contempt he turned on his heel, vaulted into bed, and
pulled the hangings shut with such violence that they were ripped
from the bed and fell in a dusty pile to the floor. Ron glared at Seamus, then looked at Dean and Neville.
“Anyone else’s parents got a problem with Harry?” he said
aggressively.
“My parents are Muggles, mate,” said Dean, shrugging. “They
don’t know nothing about no deaths at Hogwarts, because I’m not
stupid enough to tell them.”
“You don’t know my mother, she’ll weasel anything out of anyone!”
Seamus snapped at him. “Anyway, your parents don’t get the Daily
Prophet, they don’t know our headmaster’s been sacked from the Wizengamot and the International Confederation of Wizards because he’s
losing his marbles —”
“My gran says that’s rubbish,” piped up Neville. “She says it’s the
Daily Prophet that’s going downhill, not Dumbledore. She’s canceled
our subscription. We believe Harry,” he said simply. He climbed into
bed and pulled the covers up to his chin, looking owlishly over them
at Seamus. “My gran’s always said You-Know-Who would come back
one day. She says if Dumbledore says he’s back, he’s back.”
Harry felt a rush of gratitude toward Neville. Nobody else said
anything. Seamus got out his wand, repaired the bed hangings, and


219



CHAPTER ELEVEN
vanished behind them. Dean got into bed, rolled over, and fell silent.
Neville, who appeared to have nothing more to say either, was gazing
fondly at his moonlit cactus.
Harry lay back on his pillows while Ron bustled around the next
bed, putting his things away. He felt shaken by the argument with
Seamus, whom he had always liked very much. How many more people were going to suggest that he was lying or unhinged?
Had Dumbledore suffered like this all summer, as first the Wizengamot, then the International Confederation of Wizards had thrown
him from their ranks? Was it anger at Harry, perhaps, that had
stopped Dumbledore getting in touch with him for months? The two
of them were in this together, after all; Dumbledore had believed
Harry, announced his version of events to the whole school and then
to the wider Wizarding community. Anyone who thought Harry was
a liar had to think that Dumbledore was too or else that Dumbledore
had been hoodwinked. . . .
They’ll know we’re right in the end, thought Harry miserably, as Ron
got into bed and extinguished the last candle in the dormitory. But he
wondered how many attacks like Seamus’s he would have to endure
before that time came.

eamus dressed at top speed next morning and left the dormitory
before Harry had even put on his socks.
“Does he think he’ll turn into a nutter if he stays in a room with me
too long?” asked Harry loudly, as the hem of Seamus’s robes whipped
out of sight.
“Don’t worry about it, Harry,” Dean muttered, hoisting his schoolbag onto his shoulder. “He’s just . . .” But apparently he was unable to
say exactly what Seamus was, and after a slightly awkward pause followed him out of the room.
Neville and Ron both gave Harry it’s-his-problem-not-yours looks,
but Harry was not much consoled. How much more of this was he
going to have to take?
“What’s the matter?” asked Hermione five minutes later, catching
up with Harry and Ron halfway across the common room as they all
headed toward breakfast. “You look absolutely — oh for heaven’s
sake.”
She was staring at the common room notice board, where a large
new sign had been put up.

“They are the limit,” said Hermione grimly, taking down the sign,
which Fred and George had pinned up over a poster giving the date of
the first Hogsmeade weekend in October. “We’ll have to talk to them,
Ron.”
Ron looked positively alarmed.
“Why?”
“Because we’re prefects!” said Hermione, as they climbed out
through the portrait hole. “It’s up to us to stop this kind of thing!”
Ron said nothing; Harry could tell from his glum expression that
the prospect of stopping Fred and George doing exactly what they
liked was not one that he found inviting.
“Anyway, what’s up, Harry?” Hermione continued, as they walked
down a flight of stairs lined with portraits of old witches and wizards,
all of whom ignored them, being engrossed in their own conversation.
“You look really angry about something.”
“Seamus reckons Harry’s lying about You-Know-Who,” said Ron
succinctly, when Harry did not respond.
Hermione, whom Harry had expected to react angrily on his behalf,
sighed.
“Yes, Lavender thinks so too,” she said gloomily.
“Been having a nice little chat with her about whether or not I’m a
lying, attention-seeking prat, have you?” Harry said loudly.
“No,” said Hermione calmly, “I told her to keep her big fat mouth

shut about you, actually. And it would be quite nice if you stopped
jumping down Ron’s and my throats, Harry, because if you haven’t
noticed, we’re on your side.”
There was a short pause.
“Sorry,” said Harry in a low voice.
“That’s quite all right,” said Hermione with dignity. Then she
shook her head. “Don’t you remember what Dumbledore said at the
end-of-term feast last year?”
Harry and Ron both looked at her blankly, and Hermione sighed
again.
“About You-Know-Who. He said, ‘His gift for spreading discord and
enmity is very great. We can fight it only by showing an equally strong
bond of friendship and trust —’ ”
“How do you remember stuff like that?” asked Ron, looking at her
in admiration.
“I listen, Ron,” said Hermione with a touch of asperity.
“So do I, but I still couldn’t tell you exactly what —”
“The point,” Hermione pressed on loudly, “is that this sort of thing
is exactly what Dumbledore was talking about. You-Know-Who’s
only been back two months, and we’ve started fighting among ourselves. And the Sorting Hat’s warning was the same — stand together,
be united —”
“And Harry said it last night,” retorted Ron, “if that means we’re
supposed to get matey with the Slytherins, fat chance.”
“Well, I think it’s a pity we’re not trying for a bit of inter-House
unity,” said Hermione crossly.
They had reached the foot of the marble staircase. A line of fourthyear Ravenclaws was crossing the entrance hall; they caught sight of
Harry and hurried to form a tighter group, as though frightened he
might attack stragglers.
“Yeah, we really ought to be trying to make friends with people like
that,” said Harry sarcastically.


223

CHAPTER TWELVE
They followed the Ravenclaws into the Great Hall, looking instinctively at the staff table as they entered. Professor Grubbly-Plank
was chatting to Professor Sinistra, the Astronomy teacher, and Hagrid
was once again conspicuous only by his absence. The enchanted ceiling above them echoed Harry’s mood; it was a miserable rain-cloud
gray.
“Dumbledore didn’t even mention how long that Grubbly-Plank
woman’s staying,” he said, as they made their way across to the
Gryffindor table.
“Maybe . . .” said Hermione thoughtfully.
“What?” said both Harry and Ron together.
“Well . . . maybe he didn’t want to draw attention to Hagrid not
being here.”
“What d’you mean, draw attention to it?” said Ron, half laughing.
“How could we not notice?”
Before Hermione could answer, a tall black girl with long, braided
hair had marched up to Harry.
“Hi, Angelina.”
“Hi,” she said briskly, “good summer?” And without waiting for an
answer, “Listen, I’ve been made Gryffindor Quidditch Captain.”
“Nice one,” said Harry, grinning at her; he suspected Angelina’s
pep talks might not be as long-winded as Oliver Wood’s had been,
which could only be an improvement.
“Yeah, well, we need a new Keeper now Oliver’s left. Tryouts are on
Friday at five o’clock and I want the whole team there, all right? Then
we can see how the new person’ll fit in.”
“Okay,” said Harry, and she smiled at him and departed.
“I’d forgotten Wood had left,” said Hermione vaguely, sitting down
beside Ron and pulling a plate of toast toward her. “I suppose that will
make quite a difference to the team?”
“I s’pose,” said Harry, taking the bench opposite. “He was a good
Keeper. . . .”

“Still, it won’t hurt to have some new blood, will it?” said Ron.
With a whoosh and a clatter, hundreds of owls came soaring in
through the upper windows. They descended all over the Hall, bringing letters and packages to their owners and showering the breakfasters
with droplets of water; it was clearly raining hard outside. Hedwig was
nowhere to be seen, but Harry was hardly surprised; his only correspondent was Sirius, and he doubted Sirius would have anything new
to tell him after only twenty-four hours apart. Hermione, however,
had to move her orange juice aside quickly to make way for a large
damp barn owl bearing a sodden Daily Prophet in its beak.
“What are you still getting that for?” said Harry irritably, thinking
of Seamus, as Hermione placed a Knut in the leather pouch on the
owl’s leg and it took off again. “I’m not bothering . . . load of
rubbish.”
“It’s best to know what the enemy are saying,” said Hermione
darkly, and she unfurled the newspaper and disappeared behind it,
not emerging until Harry and Ron had finished eating.
“Nothing,” she said simply, rolling up the newspaper and laying it
down by her plate. “Nothing about you or Dumbledore or anything.”
Professor McGonagall was now moving along the table handing
out schedules.
“Look at today!” groaned Ron. “History of Magic, double Potions,
Divination, and double Defense Against the Dark Arts . . . Binns,
Snape, Trelawney, and that Umbridge woman all in one day! I wish Fred
and George’d hurry up and get those Skiving Snackboxes sorted. . . .”
“Do mine ears deceive me?” said Fred, arriving with George and
squeezing onto the bench beside Harry. “Hogwarts prefects surely
don’t wish to skive off lessons?”
“Look what we’ve got today,” said Ron grumpily, shoving his
schedule under Fred’s nose. “That’s the worst Monday I’ve ever seen.”
“Fair point, little bro,” said Fred, scanning the column. “You can
have a bit of Nosebleed Nougat cheap if you like.”


225



CHAPTER TWELVE
“Why’s it cheap?” said Ron suspiciously.
“Because you’ll keep bleeding till you shrivel up, we haven’t got an
antidote yet,” said George, helping himself to a kipper.
“Cheers,” said Ron moodily, pocketing his schedule, “but I think
I’ll take the lessons.”
“And speaking of your Skiving Snackboxes,” said Hermione, eyeing
Fred and George beadily, “you can’t advertise for testers on the
Gryffindor notice board.”
“Says who?” said George, looking astonished.
“Says me,” said Hermione. “And Ron.”
“Leave me out of it,” said Ron hastily.
Hermione glared at him. Fred and George sniggered.
“You’ll be singing a different tune soon enough, Hermione,” said
Fred, thickly buttering a crumpet. “You’re starting your fifth year,
you’ll be begging us for a Snackbox before long.”
“And why would starting fifth year mean I want a Skiving Snackbox?” asked Hermione.
“Fifth year’s O.W.L. year,” said George.
“So?”
“So you’ve got your exams coming up, haven’t you? They’ll be keeping your noses so hard to that grindstone they’ll be rubbed raw,” said
Fred with satisfaction.
“Half our year had minor breakdowns coming up to O.W.L.s,” said
George happily. “Tears and tantrums . . . Patricia Stimpson kept coming over faint. . . .”
“Kenneth Towler came out in boils, d’you remember?” said Fred
reminiscently.
“That’s ’cause you put Bulbadox Powder in his pajamas,” said
George.
“Oh yeah,” said Fred, grinning. “I’d forgotten. . . . Hard to keep
track sometimes, isn’t it?”
“Anyway, it’s a nightmare of a year, the fifth,” said George. “If you


226



PROFESSOR UMBRIDGE
care about exam results anyway. Fred and I managed to keep our spirits up somehow.”
“Yeah . . . you got, what was it, three O.W.L.s each?” said Ron.
“Yep,” said Fred unconcernedly. “But we feel our futures lie outside
the world of academic achievement.”
“We seriously debated whether we were going to bother coming
back for our seventh year,” said George brightly, “now that we’ve
got —”
He broke off at a warning look from Harry, who knew George had
been about to mention the Triwizard winnings he had given them.
“— now that we’ve got our O.W.L.s,” George said hastily. “I mean,
do we really need N.E.W.T.s? But we didn’t think Mum could take us
leaving school early, not on top of Percy turning out to be the world’s
biggest prat.”
“We’re not going to waste our last year here, though,” said Fred,
looking affectionately around at the Great Hall. “We’re going to use it
to do a bit of market research, find out exactly what the average Hogwarts student requires from his joke shop, carefully evaluate the results
of our research, and then produce the products to fit the demand.”
“But where are you going to get the gold to start a joke shop?”
asked Hermione skeptically. “You’re going to need all the ingredients
and materials — and premises too, I suppose. . . .”
Harry did not look at the twins. His face felt hot; he deliberately
dropped his fork and dived down to retrieve it. He heard Fred say
overhead, “Ask us no questions and we’ll tell you no lies, Hermione.
C’mon, George, if we get there early we might be able to sell a few Extendable Ears before Herbology.”
Harry emerged from under the table to see Fred and George walking away, each carrying a stack of toast.
“What did that mean?” said Hermione, looking from Harry to
Ron. “ ‘Ask us no questions . . .’ Does that mean they’ve already got
some gold to start a joke shop?”


CHAPTER TWELVE
“You know, I’ve been wondering about that,” said Ron, his brow
furrowed. “They bought me a new set of dress robes this summer, and
I couldn’t understand where they got the Galleons. . . .”
Harry decided it was time to steer the conversation out of these
dangerous waters.
“D’you reckon it’s true this year’s going to be really tough? Because
of the exams?”
“Oh yeah,” said Ron. “Bound to be, isn’t it? O.W.L.s are really
important, affect the jobs you can apply for and everything. We get
career advice too, later this year, Bill told me. So you can choose what
N.E.W.T.s you want to do next year.”
“D’you know what you want to do after Hogwarts?” Harry asked
the other two, as they left the Great Hall shortly afterward and set off
toward their History of Magic classroom.
“Not really,” said Ron slowly. “Except . . . well . . .”
He looked slightly sheepish.
“What?” Harry urged him.
“Well, it’d be cool to be an Auror,” said Ron in an offhand voice.
“Yeah, it would,” said Harry fervently.
“But they’re, like, the elite,” said Ron. “You’ve got to be really good.
What about you, Hermione?”
“I don’t know,” said Hermione. “I think I’d really like to do something worthwhile.”
“An Auror’s worthwhile!” said Harry.
“Yes, it is, but it’s not the only worthwhile thing,” said Hermione
thoughtfully. “I mean, if I could take S.P.E.W. further . . .”
Harry and Ron carefully avoided looking at each other.
History of Magic was by common consent the most boring subject
ever devised by Wizard-kind. Professor Binns, their ghost teacher, had
a wheezy, droning voice that was almost guaranteed to cause severe
drowsiness within ten minutes, five in warm weather. He never varied
the form of their lessons, but lectured them without pausing while


228



PROFESSOR UMBRIDGE
they took notes, or rather, gazed sleepily into space. Harry and Ron
had so far managed to scrape passes in this subject only by copying
Hermione’s notes before exams; she alone seemed able to resist the soporific power of Binns’s voice.
Today they suffered through three quarters of an hour’s droning on
the subject of giant wars. Harry heard just enough within the first ten
minutes to appreciate dimly that in another teacher’s hands this
subject might have been mildly interesting, but then his brain
disengaged, and he spent the remaining thirty-five minutes playing
hangman on a corner of his parchment with Ron, while Hermione
shot them filthy looks out of the corner of her eye.
“How would it be,” she asked them coldly as they left the classroom
for break (Binns drifting away through the blackboard), “if I refused
to lend you my notes this year?”
“We’d fail our O.W.L.s,” said Ron. “If you want that on your conscience, Hermione . . .”
“Well, you’d deserve it,” she snapped. “You don’t even try to listen
to him, do you?”
“We do try,” said Ron. “We just haven’t got your brains or your
memory or your concentration — you’re just cleverer than we are —
is it nice to rub it in?”
“Oh, don’t give me that rubbish,” said Hermione, but she looked
slightly mollified as she led the way out into the damp courtyard.
A fine misty drizzle was falling, so that the people standing in huddles around the yard looked blurred at the edges. Harry, Ron, and
Hermione chose a secluded corner under a heavily dripping balcony,
turning up the collars of their robes against the chilly September air
and talking about what Snape was likely to set them in the first lesson
of the year. They had got as far as agreeing that it was likely to be
something extremely difficult, just to catch them off guard after a
two-month holiday, when someone walked around the corner toward
them.


229



CHAPTER TWELVE
“Hello, Harry!”
It was Cho Chang and what was more, she was on her own again.
This was most unusual: Cho was almost always surrounded by a gang
of giggling girls; Harry remembered the agony of trying to get her by
herself to ask her to the Yule Ball.
“Hi,” said Harry, feeling his face grow hot. At least you’re not covered
in Stinksap this time, he told himself. Cho seemed to be thinking along
the same lines.
“You got that stuff off, then?”
“Yeah,” said Harry, trying to grin as though the memory of their
last meeting was funny as opposed to mortifying. “So did you . . . er
. . . have a good summer?”
The moment he had said this he wished he hadn’t: Cedric had been
Cho’s boyfriend and the memory of his death must have affected her
holiday almost as badly as it had affected Harry’s. . . . Something
seemed to tauten in her face, but she said, “Oh, it was all right, you
know. . . .”
“Is that a Tornados badge?” Ron demanded suddenly, pointing at
the front of Cho’s robes, to which a sky-blue badge emblazoned with
a double gold T was pinned. “You don’t support them, do you?”
“Yeah, I do,” said Cho.
“Have you always supported them, or just since they started winning the league?” said Ron, in what Harry considered an unnecessarily
accusatory tone of voice.
“I’ve supported them since I was six,” said Cho coolly. “Anyway . . .
see you, Harry.”
She walked away. Hermione waited until Cho was halfway across
the courtyard before rounding on Ron.
“You are so tactless!”
“What? I only asked her if —”
“Couldn’t you tell she wanted to talk to Harry on her own?”


230



PROFESSOR UMBRIDGE
“So? She could’ve done, I wasn’t stopping —”
“What on earth were you attacking her about her Quidditch team
for?”
“Attacking? I wasn’t attacking her, I was only —”
“Who cares if she supports the Tornados?”
“Oh, come on, half the people you see wearing those badges only
bought them last season —”
“But what does it matter?”
“It means they’re not real fans, they’re just jumping on the
bandwagon —”
“That’s the bell,” said Harry listlessly, because Ron and Hermione
were bickering too loudly to hear it. They did not stop arguing all the
way down to Snape’s dungeon, which gave Harry plenty of time to reflect that between Neville and Ron he would be lucky ever to have two
minutes’ conversation with Cho that he could look back on without
wanting to leave the country.
And yet, he thought, as they joined the queue lining up outside
Snape’s classroom door, she had chosen to come and talk to him, hadn’t
she? She had been Cedric’s girlfriend; she could easily have hated Harry
for coming out of the Triwizard maze alive when Cedric had died, yet
she was talking to him in a perfectly friendly way, not as though she
thought him mad, or a liar, or in some horrible way responsible for
Cedric’s death. . . . Yes, she had definitely chosen to come and talk to
him, and that made the second time in two days . . . and at this
thought, Harry’s spirits rose. Even the ominous sound of Snape’s dungeon door creaking open did not puncture the small, hopeful bubble
that seemed to have swelled in his chest. He filed into the classroom behind Ron and Hermione and followed them to their usual table at the
back, ignoring the huffy, irritable noises now issuing from both of them.
“Settle down,” said Snape coldly, shutting the door behind him.
There was no real need for the call to order; the moment the class


231



CHAPTER TWELVE
had heard the door close, quiet had fallen and all fidgeting stopped.
Snape’s mere presence was usually enough to ensure a class’s silence.
“Before we begin today’s lesson,” said Snape, sweeping over to his
desk and staring around at them all, “I think it appropriate to remind
you that next June you will be sitting an important examination, during which you will prove how much you have learned about the
composition and use of magical potions. Moronic though some of
this class undoubtedly are, I expect you to scrape an ‘Acceptable’ in
your O.W.L., or suffer my . . . displeasure.”
His gaze lingered this time upon Neville, who gulped.
“After this year, of course, many of you will cease studying with
me,” Snape went on. “I take only the very best into my N.E.W.T.
Potions class, which means that some of us will certainly be saying
good-bye.”
His eyes rested on Harry and his lip curled. Harry glared back, feeling a grim pleasure at the idea that he would be able to give up Potions
after fifth year.
“But we have another year to go before that happy moment of
farewell,” said Snape softly, “so whether you are intending to attempt
N.E.W.T. or not, I advise all of you to concentrate your efforts upon
maintaining the high-pass level I have come to expect from my
O.W.L. students.
“Today we will be mixing a potion that often comes up at Ordinary
Wizarding Level: the Draught of Peace, a potion to calm anxiety and
soothe agitation. Be warned: If you are too heavy-handed with the
ingredients you will put the drinker into a heavy and sometimes irreversible sleep, so you will need to pay close attention to what you are
doing.” On Harry’s left, Hermione sat up a little straighter, her expression one of the utmost attentiveness. “The ingredients and method”
— Snape flicked his wand — “are on the blackboard” — (they appeared there) — “you will find everything you need” — he flicked his


232



PROFESSOR UMBRIDGE
wand again — “in the store cupboard” — (the door of the said cupboard sprang open) — “you have an hour and a half. . . . Start.”
Just as Harry, Ron, and Hermione had predicted, Snape could
hardly have set them a more difficult, fiddly potion. The ingredients
had to be added to the cauldron in precisely the right order and quantities; the mixture had to be stirred exactly the right number of times,
firstly in clockwise, then in counterclockwise directions; the heat of
the flames on which it was simmering had to be lowered to exactly the
right level for a specific number of minutes before the final ingredient
was added.
“A light silver vapor should now be rising from your potion,” called
Snape, with ten minutes left to go.
Harry, who was sweating profusely, looked desperately around the
dungeon. His own cauldron was issuing copious amounts of dark gray
steam; Ron’s was spitting green sparks. Seamus was feverishly prodding the flames at the base of his cauldron with the tip of his wand, as
they had gone out. The surface of Hermione’s potion, however, was a
shimmering mist of silver vapor, and as Snape swept by he looked
down his hooked nose at it without comment, which meant that he
could find nothing to criticize. At Harry’s cauldron, however, Snape
stopped, looking down at Harry with a horrible smirk on his face.
“Potter, what is this supposed to be?”
The Slytherins at the front of the class all looked up eagerly; they
loved hearing Snape taunt Harry.
“The Draught of Peace,” said Harry tensely.
“Tell me, Potter,” said Snape softly, “can you read?”
Draco Malfoy laughed.
“Yes, I can,” said Harry, his fingers clenched tightly around his
wand.
“Read the third line of the instructions for me, Potter.”
Harry squinted at the blackboard; it was not easy to make out the


233



CHAPTER TWELVE
instructions through the haze of multicolored steam now filling the
dungeon.
“ ‘Add powdered moonstone, stir three times counterclockwise, allow to simmer for seven minutes, then add two drops of syrup of
hellebore.’ ”
His heart sank. He had not added syrup of hellebore, but had proceeded straight to the fourth line of the instructions after allowing his
potion to simmer for seven minutes.
“Did you do everything on the third line, Potter?”
“No,” said Harry very quietly.
“I beg your pardon?”
“No,” said Harry, more loudly. “I forgot the hellebore. . . .”
“I know you did, Potter, which means that this mess is utterly
worthless. Evanesco.”
The contents of Harry’s potion vanished; he was left standing foolishly beside an empty cauldron.
“Those of you who have managed to read the instructions, fill one
flagon with a sample of your potion, label it clearly with your name,
and bring it up to my desk for testing,” said Snape. “Homework:
twelve inches of parchment on the properties of moonstone and its
uses in potion-making, to be handed in on Thursday.”
While everyone around him filled their flagons, Harry cleared away
his things, seething. His potion had been no worse than Ron’s, which
was now giving off a foul odor of bad eggs, or Neville’s, which had
achieved the consistency of just-mixed cement and which Neville was
now having to gouge out of his cauldron, yet it was he, Harry, who
would be receiving zero marks for the day’s work. He stuffed his wand
back into his bag and slumped down onto his seat, watching everyone
else march up to Snape’s desk with filled and corked flagons. When at
long last the bell rang, Harry was first out of the dungeon and had already started his lunch by the time Ron and Hermione joined him in


234



PROFESSOR UMBRIDGE
the Great Hall. The ceiling had turned an even murkier gray during
the morning. Rain was lashing the high windows.
“That was really unfair,” said Hermione consolingly, sitting down
next to Harry and helping herself to shepherd’s pie. “Your potion
wasn’t nearly as bad as Goyle’s, when he put it in his flagon the whole
thing shattered and set his robes on fire.”
“Yeah, well,” said Harry, glowering at his plate, “since when has
Snape ever been fair to me?”
Neither of the others answered; all three of them knew that Snape
and Harry’s mutual enmity had been absolute from the moment
Harry had set foot in Hogwarts.
“I did think he might be a bit better this year,” said Hermione in a
disappointed voice. “I mean . . . you know . . .” She looked carefully
around; there were half a dozen empty seats on either side of them and
nobody was passing the table. “. . . Now he’s in the Order and
everything.”
“Poisonous toadstools don’t change their spots,” said Ron sagely.
“Anyway, I’ve always thought Dumbledore was cracked trusting
Snape, where’s the evidence he ever really stopped working for YouKnow-Who?”
“I think Dumbledore’s probably got plenty of evidence, even if he
doesn’t share it with you, Ron,” snapped Hermione.
“Oh, shut up, the pair of you,” said Harry heavily, as Ron opened
his mouth to argue back. Hermione and Ron both froze, looking angry and offended. “Can’t you give it a rest?” he said. “You’re always
having a go at each other, it’s driving me mad.” And abandoning his
shepherd’s pie, he swung his schoolbag back over his shoulder and left
them sitting there.
He walked up the marble staircase two steps at a time, past the
many students hurrying toward lunch. The anger that had just flared
so unexpectedly still blazed inside him, and the vision of Ron and


235



CHAPTER TWELVE
Hermione’s shocked faces afforded him a sense of deep satisfaction.
Serve them right, he thought. Why can’t they give it a rest? . . . Bickering
all the time . . . It’s enough to drive anyone up the wall. . . .
He passed the large picture of Sir Cadogan the knight on a landing;
Sir Cadogan drew his sword and brandished it fiercely at Harry, who
ignored him.
“Come back, you scurvy dog, stand fast and fight!” yelled Sir Cadogan in a muffled voice from behind his visor, but Harry merely walked
on, and when Sir Cadogan attempted to follow him by running into
a neighboring picture, he was rebuffed by its inhabitant, a large and
angry-looking wolfhound.
Harry spent the rest of the lunch hour sitting alone underneath the
trapdoor at the top of North Tower, and consequently he was the first
to ascend the silver ladder that led to Sibyll Trelawney’s classroom
when the bell rang.
Divination was Harry’s least favorite class after Potions, which was
due mainly to Professor Trelawney’s habit of predicting his premature
death every few lessons. A thin woman, heavily draped in shawls and
glittering with strings of beads, she always reminded Harry of some
kind of insect, with her glasses hugely magnifying her eyes. She was
busy putting copies of battered, leather-bound books on each of the
spindly little tables with which her room was littered when Harry entered the room, but so dim was the light cast by the lamps covered by
scarves and the low-burning, sickly-scented fire that she appeared not
to notice him as he took a seat in the shadows. The rest of the class arrived over the next five minutes. Ron emerged from the trapdoor,
looked around carefully, spotted Harry and made directly for him, or
as directly as he could while having to wend his way between tables,
chairs, and overstuffed poufs.
“Hermione and me have stopped arguing,” he said, sitting down
beside Harry.
“Good,” grunted Harry.

“But Hermione says she thinks it would be nice if you stopped taking out your temper on us,” said Ron.
“I’m not —”
“I’m just passing on the message,” said Ron, talking over him. “But
I reckon she’s right. It’s not our fault how Seamus and Snape treat
you.”
“I never said it —”
“Good day,” said Professor Trelawney in her usual misty, dreamy
voice, and Harry broke off, feeling both annoyed and slightly
ashamed of himself again. “And welcome back to Divination. I have,
of course, been following your fortunes most carefully over the holidays, and am delighted to see that you have all returned to Hogwarts
safely — as, of course, I knew you would.
“You will find on the tables before you copies of The Dream Oracle,
by Inigo Imago. Dream interpretation is a most important means of divining the future and one that may very probably be tested in your
O.W.L. Not, of course, that I believe examination passes or failures are
of the remotest importance when it comes to the sacred art of divination. If you have the Seeing Eye, certificates and grades matter very
little. However, the headmaster likes you to sit the examination, so . . .”
Her voice trailed away delicately, leaving them all in no doubt that
Professor Trelawney considered her subject above such sordid matters
as examinations.
“Turn, please, to the introduction and read what Imago has to say
on the matter of dream interpretation. Then divide into pairs. Use
The Dream Oracle to interpret each other’s most recent dreams. Carry
on.
The one good thing to be said for this lesson was that it was not a
double period. By the time they had all finished reading the introduction of the book, they had barely ten minutes left for dream interpretation. At the table next to Harry and Ron, Dean had paired up with
Neville, who immediately embarked on a long-winded explanation of


237



CHAPTER TWELVE
a nightmare involving a pair of giant scissors wearing his grandmother’s best hat; Harry and Ron merely looked at each other glumly.
“I never remember my dreams,” said Ron. “You say one.”
“You must remember one of them,” said Harry impatiently.
He was not going to share his dreams with anyone. He knew perfectly well what his regular nightmare about a graveyard meant, he did
not need Ron or Professor Trelawney or the stupid Dream Oracle to
tell him that. . . .
“Well, I had one that I was playing Quidditch the other night,”
said Ron, screwing up his face in an effort to remember. “What d’you
reckon that means?”
“Probably that you’re going to be eaten by a giant marshmallow or
something,” said Harry, turning the pages of The Dream Oracle without interest.
It was very dull work looking up bits of dreams in the Oracle and
Harry was not cheered up when Professor Trelawney set them the task
of keeping a dream diary for a month as homework. When the bell
went, he and Ron led the way back down the ladder, Ron grumbling
loudly.
“D’you realize how much homework we’ve got already? Binns set
us a foot-and-a-half-long essay on giant wars, Snape wants a foot on
the use of moonstones, and now we’ve got a month’s dream diary from
Trelawney! Fred and George weren’t wrong about O.W.L. year, were
they? That Umbridge woman had better not give us any. . . .”
When they entered the Defense Against the Dark Arts classroom
they found Professor Umbridge already seated at the teacher’s desk,
wearing the fluffy pink cardigan of the night before and the black velvet bow on top of her head. Harry was again reminded forcibly of a
large fly perched unwisely on top of an even larger toad.
The class was quiet as it entered the room; Professor Umbridge
was, as yet, an unknown quantity and nobody knew yet how strict a
disciplinarian she was likely to be.


238

PROFESSOR UMBRIDGE
“Well, good afternoon!” she said when finally the whole class had
sat down.
A few people mumbled “Good afternoon,” in reply.
“Tut, tut,” said Professor Umbridge. “That won’t do, now, will it? I
should like you, please, to reply ‘Good afternoon, Professor Umbridge.’ One more time, please. Good afternoon, class!”
“Good afternoon, Professor Umbridge,” they chanted back at her.
“There, now,” said Professor Umbridge sweetly. “That wasn’t too
difficult, was it? Wands away and quills out, please.”
Many of the class exchanged gloomy looks; the order “wands away”
had never yet been followed by a lesson they had found interesting.
Harry shoved his wand back inside his bag and pulled out quill, ink,
and parchment. Professor Umbridge opened her handbag, extracted
her own wand, which was an unusually short one, and tapped the
blackboard sharply with it; words appeared on the board at once:
Defense Against the Dark Arts
A Return to Basic Principles.
“Well now, your teaching in this subject has been rather disrupted
and fragmented, hasn’t it?” stated Professor Umbridge, turning to face
the class with her hands clasped neatly in front of her. “The constant
changing of teachers, many of whom do not seem to have followed
any Ministry-approved curriculum, has unfortunately resulted in
your being far below the standard we would expect to see in your
O.W.L. year.
“You will be pleased to know, however, that these problems are now
to be rectified. We will be following a carefully structured, theorycentered, Ministry-approved course of defensive magic this year.
Copy down the following, please.”
She rapped the blackboard again; the first message vanished and
was replaced by:


239



CHAPTER TWELVE
Course aims:
1. Understanding the principles underlying defensive magic.
2. Learning to recognize situations in which defensive magic
can legally be used.
3. Placing the use of defensive magic in a context for
practical use.
For a couple of minutes the room was full of the sound of scratching quills on parchment. When everyone had copied down Professor
Umbridge’s three course aims she said, “Has everybody got a copy of
Defensive Magical Theory by Wilbert Slinkhard?”
There was a dull murmur of assent throughout the class.
“I think we’ll try that again,” said Professor Umbridge. “When I
ask you a question, I should like you to reply ‘Yes, Professor Umbridge,’ or ‘No, Professor Umbridge.’ So, has everyone got a copy of
Defensive Magical Theory by Wilbert Slinkhard?”
“Yes, Professor Umbridge,” rang through the room.
“Good,” said Professor Umbridge. “I should like you to turn to
page five and read chapter one, ‘Basics for Beginners.’ There will be
no need to talk.”
Professor Umbridge left the blackboard and settled herself in the
chair behind the teacher’s desk, observing them all with those pouchy
toad’s eyes. Harry turned to page five of his copy of Defensive Magical
Theory and started to read.
It was desperately dull, quite as bad as listening to Professor Binns.
He felt his concentration sliding away from him; he had soon read the
same line half a dozen times without taking in more than the first few
words. Several silent minutes passed. Next to him, Ron was absentmindedly turning his quill over and over in his fingers, staring at the
same spot on the page. Harry looked right and received a surprise to
shake him out of his torpor. Hermione had not even opened her copy


240



PROFESSOR UMBRIDGE
of Defensive Magical Theory. She was staring fixedly at Professor Umbridge with her hand in the air.
Harry could not remember Hermione ever neglecting to read when
instructed to, or indeed resisting the temptation to open any book
that came under her nose. He looked at her questioningly, but she
merely shook her head slightly to indicate that she was not about to
answer questions, and continued to stare at Professor Umbridge, who
was looking just as resolutely in another direction.
After several more minutes had passed, however, Harry was not the
only one watching Hermione. The chapter they had been instructed
to read was so tedious that more and more people were choosing to
watch Hermione’s mute attempt to catch Professor Umbridge’s eye
than to struggle on with “Basics for Beginners.”
When more than half the class were staring at Hermione rather
than at their books, Professor Umbridge seemed to decide that she
could ignore the situation no longer.
“Did you want to ask something about the chapter, dear?” she
asked Hermione, as though she had only just noticed her.
“Not about the chapter, no,” said Hermione.
“Well, we’re reading just now,” said Professor Umbridge, showing
her small, pointed teeth. “If you have other queries we can deal with
them at the end of class.”
“I’ve got a query about your course aims,” said Hermione.
Professor Umbridge raised her eyebrows.
“And your name is — ?”
“Hermione Granger,” said Hermione.
“Well, Miss Granger, I think the course aims are perfectly clear if
you read them through carefully,” said Professor Umbridge in a voice
of determined sweetness.
“Well, I don’t,” said Hermione bluntly. “There’s nothing written
up there about using defensive spells.”

CHAPTER TWELVE
There was a short silence in which many members of the class
turned their heads to frown at the three course aims still written on
the blackboard.
“Using defensive spells?” Professor Umbridge repeated with a little
laugh. “Why, I can’t imagine any situation arising in my classroom
that would require you to use a defensive spell, Miss Granger. You
surely aren’t expecting to be attacked during class?”
“We’re not going to use magic?” Ron ejaculated loudly.
“Students raise their hands when they wish to speak in my class,
Mr. — ?”
“Weasley,” said Ron, thrusting his hand into the air.
Professor Umbridge, smiling still more widely, turned her back on
him. Harry and Hermione immediately raised their hands too. Professor Umbridge’s pouchy eyes lingered on Harry for a moment before
she addressed Hermione.
“Yes, Miss Granger? You wanted to ask something else?”
“Yes,” said Hermione. “Surely the whole point of Defense Against
the Dark Arts is to practice defensive spells?”
“Are you a Ministry-trained educational expert, Miss Granger?”
asked Professor Umbridge in her falsely sweet voice.
“No, but —”
“Well then, I’m afraid you are not qualified to decide what the
‘whole point’ of any class is. Wizards much older and cleverer than
you have devised our new program of study. You will be learning
about defensive spells in a secure, risk-free way —”
“What use is that?” said Harry loudly. “If we’re going to be attacked
it won’t be in a —”
“Hand, Mr. Potter!” sang Professor Umbridge.
Harry thrust his fist in the air. Professor Umbridge promptly
turned away from him again, but now several other people had their
hands up too.
“And your name is?” Professor Umbridge said to Dean.


PROFESSOR UMBRIDGE
“Dean Thomas.”
“Well, Mr. Thomas?”
“Well, it’s like Harry said, isn’t it?” said Dean. “If we’re going to be
attacked, it won’t be risk-free —”
“I repeat,” said Professor Umbridge, smiling in a very irritating
fashion at Dean, “do you expect to be attacked during my classes?”
“No, but —”
Professor Umbridge talked over him.
“I do not wish to criticize the way things have been run in this
school,” she said, an unconvincing smile stretching her wide mouth,
“but you have been exposed to some very irresponsible wizards in this
class, very irresponsible indeed — not to mention,” she gave a nasty
little laugh, “extremely dangerous half-breeds.”
“If you mean Professor Lupin,” piped up Dean Thomas angrily,
“he was the best we ever —”
“Hand, Mr. Thomas! As I was saying — you have been introduced
to spells that have been complex, inappropriate to your age group, and
potentially lethal. You have been frightened into believing that you are
likely to meet Dark attacks every other day —”
“No we haven’t,” Hermione said, “we just —”
“Your hand is not up, Miss Granger!”
Hermione put up her hand; Professor Umbridge turned away from
her.
“It is my understanding that my predecessor not only performed illegal curses in front of you, he actually performed them on you —”
“Well, he turned out to be a maniac, didn’t he?” said Dean Thomas
hotly. “Mind you, we still learned loads —”
“Your hand is not up, Mr. Thomas!” trilled Professor Umbridge.
“Now, it is the view of the Ministry that a theoretical knowledge will
be more than sufficient to get you through your examination, which,
after all, is what school is all about. And your name is?” she added,
staring at Parvati, whose hand had just shot up.


243

CHAPTER TWELVE
“Parvati Patil, and isn’t there a practical bit in our Defense Against
the Dark Arts O.W.L.? Aren’t we supposed to show that we can actually do the countercurses and things?”
“As long as you have studied the theory hard enough, there is no
reason why you should not be able to perform the spells under carefully controlled examination conditions,” said Professor Umbridge
dismissively.
“Without ever practicing them before?” said Parvati incredulously.
“Are you telling us that the first time we’ll get to do the spells will be
during our exam?”
“I repeat, as long as you have studied the theory hard enough —”
“And what good’s theory going to be in the real world?” said Harry
loudly, his fist in the air again.
Professor Umbridge looked up.
“This is school, Mr. Potter, not the real world,” she said softly.
“So we’re not supposed to be prepared for what’s waiting out
there?”
“There is nothing waiting out there, Mr. Potter.”
“Oh yeah?” said Harry. His temper, which seemed to have been
bubbling just beneath the surface all day, was reaching boiling point.
“Who do you imagine wants to attack children like yourselves?”
inquired Professor Umbridge in a horribly honeyed voice.
“Hmm, let’s think . . .” said Harry in a mock thoughtful voice,
“maybe Lord Voldemort?”
Ron gasped; Lavender Brown uttered a little scream; Neville
slipped sideways off his stool. Professor Umbridge, however, did not
flinch. She was staring at Harry with a grimly satisfied expression on
her face.
“Ten points from Gryffindor, Mr. Potter.”
The classroom was silent and still. Everyone was staring at either
Umbridge or Harry.
“Now, let me make a few things quite plain.”

PROFESSOR UMBRIDGE
Professor Umbridge stood up and leaned toward them, her stubbyfingered hands splayed on her desk.
“You have been told that a certain Dark wizard has returned from
the dead —”
“He wasn’t dead,” said Harry angrily, “but yeah, he’s returned!”
“Mr.-Potter-you-have-already-lost-your-House-ten-points-do-notmake-matters-worse-for-yourself,” said Professor Umbridge in one
breath without looking at him. “As I was saying, you have been informed that a certain Dark wizard is at large once again. This is a lie.”
“It is NOT a lie!” said Harry. “I saw him, I fought him!”
“Detention, Mr. Potter!” said Professor Umbridge triumphantly.
“Tomorrow evening. Five o’clock. My office. I repeat, this is a lie. The
Ministry of Magic guarantees that you are not in danger from any
Dark wizard. If you are still worried, by all means come and see me
outside class hours. If someone is alarming you with fibs about reborn
Dark wizards, I would like to hear about it. I am here to help. I am
your friend. And now, you will kindly continue your reading. Page
five, ‘Basics for Beginners.’ ”
Professor Umbridge sat down behind her desk again. Harry, however, stood up. Everyone was staring at him; Seamus looked halfscared, half-fascinated.
“Harry, no!” Hermione whispered in a warning voice, tugging at
his sleeve, but Harry jerked his arm out of her reach.
“So, according to you, Cedric Diggory dropped dead of his own
accord, did he?” Harry asked, his voice shaking.
There was a collective intake of breath from the class, for none of
them, apart from Ron and Hermione, had ever heard Harry talk
about what had happened on the night that Cedric had died. They
stared avidly from Harry to Professor Umbridge, who had raised her
eyes and was staring at him without a trace of a fake smile on her face.
“Cedric Diggory’s death was a tragic accident,” she said coldly.
“It was murder,” said Harry. He could feel himself shaking. He had


245



CHAPTER TWELVE
hardly talked to anyone about this, least of all thirty eagerly listening
classmates. “Voldemort killed him, and you know it.”
Professor Umbridge’s face was quite blank. For a moment he
thought she was going to scream at him. Then she said, in her softest,
most sweetly girlish voice, “Come here, Mr. Potter, dear.”
He kicked his chair aside, strode around Ron and Hermione and
up to the teacher’s desk. He could feel the rest of the class holding its
breath. He felt so angry he did not care what happened next.
Professor Umbridge pulled a small roll of pink parchment out of
her handbag, stretched it out on the desk, dipped her quill into a bottle of ink, and started scribbling, hunched over so that Harry could
not see what she was writing. Nobody spoke. After a minute or so she
rolled up the parchment and tapped it with her wand; it sealed itself
seamlessly so that he could not open it.
“Take this to Professor McGonagall, dear,” said Professor Umbridge, holding out the note to him.
He took it from her without saying a word and left the room, not
even looking back at Ron and Hermione, and slamming the classroom door shut behind him. He walked very fast along the corridor,
the note to McGonagall clutched tight in his hand, and turning a corner walked slap into Peeves the Poltergeist, a wide-faced little man
floating on his back in midair, juggling several inkwells.
“Why, it’s Potty Wee Potter!” cackled Peeves, allowing two of the
inkwells to fall to the ground where they smashed and spattered the
walls with ink; Harry jumped backward out of the way with a snarl.
“Get out of it, Peeves.”
“Oooh, Crackpot’s feeling cranky,” said Peeves, pursuing Harry
along the corridor, leering as he zoomed along above him. “What is it
this time, my fine Potty friend? Hearing voices? Seeing visions? Speaking in” — Peeves blew a gigantic raspberry — “tongues?”
“I said, leave me ALONE!” Harry shouted, running down the


246



PROFESSOR UMBRIDGE
nearest flight of stairs, but Peeves merely slid down the banister on his
back beside him.
“Oh, most think he’s barking, the Potty wee lad,
But some are more kindly and think he’s just sad,
But Peevesy knows better and says that he’s mad —”
“SHUT UP!”
A door to his left flew open and Professor McGonagall emerged
from her office looking grim and slightly harassed.
“What on earth are you shouting about, Potter?” she snapped, as
Peeves cackled gleefully and zoomed out of sight. “Why aren’t you in
class?”
“I’ve been sent to see you,” said Harry stiffly.
“Sent? What do you mean, sent?”
He held out the note from Professor Umbridge. Professor McGonagall took it from him, frowning, slit it open with a tap of her wand,
stretched it out, and began to read. Her eyes zoomed from side to side
behind their square spectacles as she read what Umbridge had written,
and with each line they became narrower.
“Come in here, Potter.”
He followed her inside her study. The door closed automatically
behind him.
“Well?” said Professor McGonagall, rounding on him. “Is this
true?”
“Is what true?” Harry asked, rather more aggressively than he had
intended. “Professor?” he added in an attempt to sound more polite.
“Is it true that you shouted at Professor Umbridge?”
“Yes,” said Harry.
“You called her a liar?”
“Yes.”


247



CHAPTER TWELVE
“You told her He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named is back?”
“Yes.”
Professor McGonagall sat down behind her desk, frowning at Harry.
Then she said, “Have a biscuit, Potter.”
“Have — what?”
“Have a biscuit,” she repeated impatiently, indicating a tartan tin of
cookies lying on top of one of the piles of papers on her desk. “And sit
down.”
There had been a previous occasion when Harry, expecting to be
caned by Professor McGonagall, had instead been appointed by her to
the Gryffindor Quidditch team. He sank into a chair opposite her and
helped himself to a Ginger Newt, feeling just as confused and wrongfooted as he had done on that occasion.
Professor McGonagall set down Professor Umbridge’s note and
looked very seriously at Harry.
“Potter, you need to be careful.”
Harry swallowed his mouthful of Ginger Newt and stared at her.
Her tone of voice was not at all what he was used to; it was not brisk,
crisp, and stern; it was low and anxious and somehow much more human than usual.
“Misbehavior in Dolores Umbridge’s class could cost you much
more than House points and a detention.”
“What do you — ?”
“Potter, use your common sense,” snapped Professor McGonagall,
with an abrupt return to her usual manner. “You know where she
comes from, you must know to whom she is reporting.”
The bell rang for the end of the lesson. Overhead and all around
came the elephantine sounds of hundreds of students on the move.
“It says here she’s given you detention every evening this week,
starting tomorrow,” Professor McGonagall said, looking down at Umbridge’s note again.


248



PROFESSOR UMBRIDGE
“Every evening this week!” Harry repeated, horrified. “But, Professor, couldn’t you — ?”
“No, I couldn’t,” said Professor McGonagall flatly.
“But —”
“She is your teacher and has every right to give you detention. You
will go to her room at five o’clock tomorrow for the first one. Just remember: Tread carefully around Dolores Umbridge.”
“But I was telling the truth!” said Harry, outraged. “Voldemort’s
back, you know he is, Professor Dumbledore knows he is —”
“For heaven’s sake, Potter!” said Professor McGonagall, straightening her glasses angrily (she had winced horribly when he had used
Voldemort’s name). “Do you really think this is about truth or lies? It’s
about keeping your head down and your temper under control!”
She stood up, nostrils wide and mouth very thin, and he stood too.
“Have another biscuit,” she said irritably, thrusting the tin at him.
“No, thanks,” said Harry coldly.
“Don’t be ridiculous,” she snapped.
He took one.
“Thanks,” he said grudgingly.
“Didn’t you listen to Dolores Umbridge’s speech at the start-ofterm feast, Potter?”
“Yeah,” said Harry. “Yeah . . . she said . . . progress will be prohibited or . . . well, it meant that . . . that the Ministry of Magic is trying
to interfere at Hogwarts.”
Professor McGonagall eyed him for a moment, then sniffed,
walked around her desk, and held open the door for him.
“Well, I’m glad you listen to Hermione Granger at any rate,” she
said, pointing him out of her office.

inner in the Great Hall that night was not a pleasant experience for Harry. The news about his shouting match with
Umbridge seemed to have traveled exceptionally fast even by Hogwarts standards. He heard whispers all around him as he sat eating
between Ron and Hermione. The funny thing was that none of the
whisperers seemed to mind him overhearing what they were saying
about him — on the contrary, it was as though they were hoping he
would get angry and start shouting again, so that they could hear his
story firsthand.
“He says he saw Cedric Diggory murdered. . . .”
“He reckons he dueled with You-Know-Who. . . .”
“Come off it. . . .”
“Who does he think he’s kidding?”
“Pur-lease . . .”
“What I don’t get,” said Harry in a shaking voice, laying down his
knife and fork (his hands were trembling too much to hold them
steady), “is why they all believed the story two months ago when
Dumbledore told them. . . .”


“The thing is, Harry, I’m not sure they did,” said Hermione
grimly. “Oh, let’s get out of here.”
She slammed down her own knife and fork; Ron looked sadly at his
half-finished apple pie but followed suit. People stared at them all the
way out of the Hall.
“What d’you mean, you’re not sure they believed Dumbledore?”
Harry asked Hermione when they reached the first-floor landing.
“Look, you don’t understand what it was like after it happened,”
said Hermione quietly. “You arrived back in the middle of the lawn
clutching Cedric’s dead body. . . . None of us saw what happened in
the maze. . . . We just had Dumbledore’s word for it that You-KnowWho had come back and killed Cedric and fought you.”
“Which is the truth!” said Harry loudly.
“I know it is, Harry, so will you please stop biting my head off?”
said Hermione wearily. “It’s just that before the truth could sink in,
everyone went home for the summer, where they spent two months
reading about how you’re a nutcase and Dumbledore’s going senile!”
Rain pounded on the windowpanes as they strode along the empty
corridors back to Gryffindor Tower. Harry felt as though his first day
had lasted a week, but he still had a mountain of homework to do before bed. A dull pounding pain was developing over his right eye. He
glanced out of a rain-washed window at the dark grounds as they turned
into the Fat Lady’s corridor. There was still no light in Hagrid’s cabin.
“Mimbulus mimbletonia,” said Hermione, before the Fat Lady
could ask. The portrait swung open to reveal the hole behind and the
three of them scrambled back through it.
The common room was almost empty; nearly everyone was still
down at dinner. Crookshanks uncoiled himself from an armchair and
trotted to meet them, purring loudly, and when Harry, Ron, and
Hermione took their three favorite chairs at the fireside he leapt
lightly into Hermione’s lap and curled up there like a furry ginger
cushion. Harry gazed into the flames, feeling drained and exhausted.


251

CHAPTER THIRTEEN
“How can Dumbledore have let this happen?” Hermione cried suddenly, making Harry and Ron jump; Crookshanks leapt off her, looking affronted. She pounded the arms of her chair in fury, so that bits
of stuffing leaked out of the holes. “How can he let that terrible
woman teach us? And in our O.W.L. year too!”
“Well, we’ve never had great Defense Against the Dark Arts teachers, have we?” said Harry. “You know what it’s like, Hagrid told us,
nobody wants the job, they say it’s jinxed.”
“Yes, but to employ someone who’s actually refusing to let us do
magic! What’s Dumbledore playing at?”
“And she’s trying to get people to spy for her,” said Ron darkly. “Remember when she said she wanted us to come and tell her if we hear
anyone saying You-Know-Who’s back?”
“Of course she’s here to spy on us all, that’s obvious, why else would
Fudge have wanted her to come?” snapped Hermione.
“Don’t start arguing again,” said Harry wearily, as Ron opened his
mouth to retaliate. “Can’t we just . . . Let’s just do that homework, get
it out of the way. . . .”
They collected their schoolbags from a corner and returned to the
chairs by the fire. People were coming back from dinner now. Harry
kept his face averted from the portrait hole, but could still sense the
stares he was attracting.
“Shall we do Snape’s stuff first?” said Ron, dipping his quill into
his ink. “ ‘The properties . . . of moonstone . . . and its uses . . . in potionmaking . . .’ ” he muttered, writing the words across the top of his
parchment as he spoke them. “There.” He underlined the title, then
looked up expectantly at Hermione.
“So what are the properties of moonstone and its uses in potionmaking?”
But Hermione was not listening; she was squinting over into the far
corner of the room, where Fred, George, and Lee Jordan were now sitting at the center of a knot of innocent-looking first years, all of whom


252

DETENTION WITH

were chewing something that seemed to have come out of a large paper bag that Fred was holding.
“No, I’m sorry, they’ve gone too far,” she said, standing up and
looking positively furious. “Come on, Ron.”
“I — what?” said Ron, plainly playing for time. “No — come on,
Hermione — we can’t tell them off for giving out sweets. . . .”
“You know perfectly well that those are bits of Nosebleed Nougat
or — or Puking Pastilles or —”
“Fainting Fancies?” Harry suggested quietly.
One by one, as though hit over the heads with invisible mallets, the
first years were slumping unconscious in their seats; some slid right
onto the floor, others merely hung over the arms of their chairs, their
tongues lolling out. Most of the people watching were laughing; Hermione, however, squared her shoulders and marched directly over to
where Fred and George now stood with clipboards, closely observing
the unconscious first years. Ron rose halfway out of his chair, hovered
uncertainly for a moment or two, then muttered to Harry, “She’s got
it under control,” before sinking as low in his chair as his lanky frame
permitted.
“That’s enough!” Hermione said forcefully to Fred and George,
both of whom looked up in mild surprise.
“Yeah, you’re right,” said George, nodding, “this dosage looks
strong enough, doesn’t it?”
“I told you this morning, you can’t test your rubbish on students!”
“We’re paying them!” said Fred indignantly.
“I don’t care, it could be dangerous!”
“Rubbish,” said Fred.
“Calm down, Hermione, they’re fine!” said Lee reassuringly as he
walked from first year to first year, inserting purple sweets into their
open mouths.
“Yeah, look, they’re coming round now,” said George.
A few of the first years were indeed stirring. Several looked so


253



CHAPTER THIRTEEN
shocked to find themselves lying on the floor, or dangling off their
chairs, that Harry was sure Fred and George had not warned them
what the sweets were going to do.
“Feel all right?” said George kindly to a small dark-haired girl lying
at his feet.
“I-I think so,” she said shakily.
“Excellent,” said Fred happily, but the next second Hermione had
snatched both his clipboard and the paper bag of Fainting Fancies
from his hands.
“It is NOT excellent!”
“ ’Course it is, they’re alive, aren’t they?” said Fred angrily.
“You can’t do this, what if you made one of them really ill?”
“We’re not going to make them ill, we’ve already tested them all on
ourselves, this is just to see if everyone reacts the same —”
“If you don’t stop doing it, I’m going to —”
“Put us in detention?” said Fred in an I’d-like-to-see-you-try-it voice.
“Make us write lines?” said George, smirking.
Onlookers all over the room were laughing. Hermione drew herself
up to her full height; her eyes were narrowed and her bushy hair
seemed to crackle with electricity.
“No,” she said, her voice quivering with anger, “but I will write to
your mother.”
“You wouldn’t,” said George, horrified, taking a step back from her.
“Oh, yes, I would,” said Hermione grimly. “I can’t stop you eating
the stupid things yourselves, but you’re not giving them to first years.”
Fred and George looked thunderstruck. It was clear that as far as
they were concerned, Hermione’s threat was way below the belt. With
a last threatening look at them, she thrust Fred’s clipboard and the bag
of Fancies back into his arms and stalked back to her chair by the fire.
Ron was now so low in his seat that his nose was roughly level with
his knees.

“Thank you for your support, Ron,” Hermione said acidly.
“You handled it fine by yourself,” Ron mumbled.
Hermione stared down at her blank piece of parchment for a few
seconds, then said edgily, “Oh, it’s no good, I can’t concentrate now.
I’m going to bed.”
She wrenched her bag open; Harry thought she was about to put
her books away, but instead she pulled out two misshapen woolly objects, placed them carefully on a table by the fireplace, covered them
with a few screwed-up bits of parchment and a broken quill, and
stood back to admire the effect.
“What in the name of Merlin are you doing?” said Ron, watching
her as though fearful for her sanity.
“They’re hats for house-elves,” she said briskly, now stuffing her
books back into her bag. “I did them over the summer. I’m a really
slow knitter without magic, but now I’m back at school I should be
able to make lots more.”
“You’re leaving out hats for the house-elves?” said Ron slowly. “And
you’re covering them up with rubbish first?”
“Yes,” said Hermione defiantly, swinging her bag onto her back.
“That’s not on,” said Ron angrily. “You’re trying to trick them into
picking up the hats. You’re setting them free when they might not
want to be free.”
“Of course they want to be free!” said Hermione at once, though
her face was turning pink. “Don’t you dare touch those hats, Ron!”
She left. Ron waited until she had disappeared through the door to
the girls’ dormitories, then cleared the rubbish off the woolly hats.
“They should at least see what they’re picking up,” he said firmly.
“Anyway . . .” He rolled up the parchment on which he had written
the title of Snape’s essay. “There’s no point trying to finish this now, I
can’t do it without Hermione, I haven’t got a clue what you’re supposed to do with moonstones, have you?”


CHAPTER THIRTEEN
Harry shook his head, noticing as he did so that the ache in his
right temple was getting worse. He thought of the long essay on giant
wars and the pain stabbed at him sharply. Knowing perfectly well that
he would regret not finishing his homework tonight when the morning came, he piled his books back into his bag.
“I’m going to bed too.”
He passed Seamus on the way to the door leading to the dormitories, but did not look at him. Harry had a fleeting impression that
Seamus had opened his mouth to speak, but sped up, and reached the
soothing peace of the stone spiral staircase without having to endure
any more provocation.
The following day dawned just as leaden and rainy as the previous
one. Hagrid was still absent from the staff table at breakfast.
“But on the plus side, no Snape today,” said Ron bracingly.
Hermione yawned widely and poured herself some coffee. She
looked mildly pleased about something, and when Ron asked her
what she had to be so happy about, she simply said, “The hats have
gone. Seems the house-elves do want freedom after all.”
“I wouldn’t bet on it,” Ron told her cuttingly. “They might not
count as clothes. They didn’t look anything like hats to me, more like
woolly bladders.”
Hermione did not speak to him all morning.
Double Charms was succeeded by double Transfiguration. Professor Flitwick and Professor McGonagall both spent the first fifteen
minutes of their lessons lecturing the class on the importance of
O.W.L.s.
“What you must remember,” said little Professor Flitwick squeakily, perched as ever on a pile of books so that he could see over the top
of his desk, “is that these examinations may influence your futures for
many years to come! If you have not already given serious thought to
your careers, now is the time to do so. And in the meantime, I’m


256

afraid, we shall be working harder than ever to ensure that you all do
yourselves justice!”
They then spent more than an hour reviewing Summoning Charms,
which according to Professor Flitwick were bound to come up in their
O.W.L., and he rounded off the lesson by setting them their largest
amount of Charms homework ever.
It was the same, if not worse, in Transfiguration.
“You cannot pass an O.W.L.,” said Professor McGonagall grimly,
“without serious application, practice, and study. I see no reason why
everybody in this class should not achieve an O.W.L. in Transfiguration
as long as they put in the work.” Neville made a sad little disbelieving noise. “Yes, you too, Longbottom,” said Professor McGonagall.
“There’s nothing wrong with your work except lack of confidence. So
. . . today we are starting Vanishing Spells. These are easier than Conjuring Spells, which you would not usually attempt until N.E.W.T.
level, but they are still among the most difficult magic you will be
tested on in your O.W.L.”
She was quite right; Harry found the Vanishing Spells horribly difficult. By the end of a double period, neither he nor Ron had managed
to vanish the snails on which they were practicing, though Ron said
hopefully that he thought his looked a bit paler. Hermione, on the
other hand, successfully vanished her snail on the third attempt, earning her a ten-point bonus for Gryffindor from Professor McGonagall.
She was the only person not given homework; everybody else was told
to practice the spell overnight, ready for a fresh attempt on their snails
the following afternoon.
Now panicking slightly about the amount of homework they had
to do, Harry and Ron spent their lunch hour in the library looking up
the uses of moonstones in potion-making. Still angry about Ron’s slur
on her woolly hats, Hermione did not join them. By the time they
reached Care of Magical Creatures in the afternoon, Harry’s head was
aching again.

CHAPTER THIRTEEN
The day had become cool and breezy, and, as they walked down
the sloping lawn toward Hagrid’s cabin on the edge of the Forbidden
Forest, they felt the occasional drop of rain on their faces. Professor
Grubbly-Plank stood waiting for the class some ten yards from Hagrid’s front door, a long trestle table in front of her laden with many
twigs. As Harry and Ron reached her, a loud shout of laughter
sounded behind them; turning, they saw Draco Malfoy striding toward them, surrounded by his usual gang of Slytherin cronies. He had
clearly just said something highly amusing, because Crabbe, Goyle,
Pansy Parkinson, and the rest continued to snigger heartily as they
gathered around the trestle table. Judging by the fact that all of them
kept looking over at Harry, he was able to guess the subject of the joke
without too much difficulty.
“Everyone here?” barked Professor Grubbly-Plank, once all the
Slytherins and Gryffindors had arrived. “Let’s crack on then — who
can tell me what these things are called?”
She indicated the heap of twigs in front of her. Hermione’s hand
shot into the air. Behind her back, Malfoy did a buck-toothed imitation of her jumping up and down in eagerness to answer a question.
Pansy Parkinson gave a shriek of laughter that turned almost at once
into a scream, as the twigs on the table leapt into the air and revealed
themselves to be what looked like tiny pixieish creatures made of
wood, each with knobbly brown arms and legs, two twiglike fingers at
the end of each hand, and a funny, flat, barklike face in which a pair
of beetle-brown eyes glittered.
“Oooooh!” said Parvati and Lavender, thoroughly irritating Harry:
Anyone would have thought that Hagrid never showed them impressive creatures; admittedly the flobberworms had been a bit dull, but
the salamanders and hippogriffs had been interesting enough, and the
Blast-Ended Skrewts perhaps too much so.
“Kindly keep your voices down, girls!” said Professor GrubblyPlank sharply, scattering a handful of what looked like brown rice


among the stick-creatures, who immediately fell upon the food.
“So — anyone know the names of these creatures? Miss Granger?”
“Bowtruckles,” said Hermione. “They’re tree-guardians, usually
live in wand-trees.”
“Five points for Gryffindor,” said Professor Grubbly-Plank. “Yes, these
are bowtruckles and, as Miss Granger rightly says, they generally live in
trees whose wood is of wand quality. Anybody know what they eat?”
“Wood lice,” said Hermione promptly, which explained why what
Harry had taken for grains of brown rice were moving. “But fairy eggs
if they can get them.”
“Good girl, take another five points. So whenever you need leaves
or wood from a tree in which a bowtruckle lodges, it is wise to have a
gift of wood lice ready to distract or placate it. They may not look
dangerous, but if angered they will gouge out human eyes with their
fingers, which, as you can see, are very sharp and not at all desirable
near the eyeballs. So if you’d like to gather closer, take a few wood lice
and a bowtruckle — I have enough here for one between three — you
can study them more closely. I want a sketch from each of you with all
body parts labeled by the end of the lesson.”
The class surged forward around the trestle table. Harry deliberately
circled around the back so that he ended up right next to Professor
Grubbly-Plank.
“Where’s Hagrid?” he asked her, while everyone else was choosing
bowtruckles.
“Never you mind,” said Professor Grubbly-Plank repressively,
which had been her attitude last time Hagrid had failed to turn up for
a class too. Smirking all over his pointed face, Draco Malfoy leaned
across Harry and seized the largest bowtruckle.
“Maybe,” said Malfoy in an undertone, so that only Harry could
hear him, “the stupid great oaf ’s got himself badly injured.”
“Maybe you will if you don’t shut up,” said Harry out of the side of
his mouth.


259

CHAPTER THIRTEEN
“Maybe he’s been messing with stuff that’s too big for him, if you
get my drift.”
Malfoy walked away, smirking over his shoulder at Harry, who suddenly felt sick. Did Malfoy know something? His father was a Death
Eater, after all; what if he had information about Hagrid’s fate that
had not yet reached the Order’s ears? He hurried back around the
table to Ron and Hermione, who were squatting on the grass some
distance away and attempting to persuade a bowtruckle to remain still
long enough to draw it. Harry pulled out parchment and quill,
crouched down beside the others, and related in a whisper what Malfoy had just said.
“Dumbledore would know if something had happened to Hagrid,”
said Hermione at once. “It’s just playing into Malfoy’s hands to look
worried, it tells him we don’t know exactly what’s going on. We’ve got
to ignore him, Harry. Here, hold the bowtruckle for a moment, just
so I can draw its face. . . .”
“Yes,” came Malfoy’s clear drawl from the group nearest them,
“Father was talking to the Minister just a couple of days ago, you
know, and it sounds as though the Ministry’s really determined to
crack down on substandard teaching in this place. So even if that overgrown moron does show up again, he’ll probably be sent packing
straight away.”
“OUCH!”
Harry had gripped the bowtruckle so hard that it had almost
snapped; it had just taken a great retaliatory swipe at his hand with its
sharp fingers, leaving two long deep cuts there. Harry dropped it;
Crabbe and Goyle, who had already been guffawing at the idea of Hagrid being sacked, laughed still harder as the bowtruckle set off at full
tilt toward the forest, a little, moving stickman soon swallowed up by
the tree roots. When the bell echoed distantly over the grounds Harry
rolled up his bloodstained bowtruckle picture and marched off to

Herbology with his hand wrapped in a handkerchief of Hermione’s
and Malfoy’s derisive laughter still ringing in his ears.
“If he calls Hagrid a moron one more time . . .” snarled Harry.
“Harry, don’t go picking a row with Malfoy, don’t forget, he’s a prefect now, he could make life difficult for you. . . .”
“Wow, I wonder what it’d be like to have a difficult life?” said Harry
sarcastically. Ron laughed, but Hermione frowned. Together they
traipsed across the vegetable patch. The sky still appeared unable to
make up its mind whether it wanted to rain or not.
“I just wish Hagrid would hurry up and get back, that’s all,” said
Harry in a low voice, as they reached the greenhouses. “And don’t say
that Grubbly-Plank woman’s a better teacher!” he added threateningly.
“I wasn’t going to,” said Hermione calmly.
“Because she’ll never be as good as Hagrid,” said Harry firmly, fully
aware that he had just experienced an exemplary Care of Magical
Creatures lesson and was thoroughly annoyed about it.
The door of the nearest greenhouse opened and some fourth years
spilled out of it, including Ginny.
“Hi,” she said brightly as she passed. A few seconds later, Luna
Lovegood emerged, trailing behind the rest of the class, a smudge of
earth on her nose and her hair tied in a knot on the top of her head.
When she saw Harry, her prominent eyes seemed to bulge excitedly
and she made a beeline straight for him. Many of his classmates
turned curiously to watch. Luna took a great breath and then said,
without so much as a preliminary hello: “I believe He-Who-MustNot-Be-Named is back, and I believe you fought him and escaped
from him.”
“Er — right,” said Harry awkwardly. Luna was wearing what
looked like a pair of orange radishes for earrings, a fact that Parvati
and Lavender seemed to have noticed, as they were both giggling and
pointing at her earlobes.


261



CHAPTER THIRTEEN
“You can laugh!” Luna said, her voice rising, apparently under the
impression that Parvati and Lavender were laughing at what she had
said rather than what she was wearing. “But people used to believe there
were no such things as the Blibbering Humdinger or the CrumpleHorned Snorkack!”
“Well, they were right, weren’t they?” said Hermione impatiently.
“There weren’t any such things as the Blibbering Humdinger or the
Crumple-Horned Snorkack.”
Luna gave her a withering look and flounced away, radishes swinging madly. Parvati and Lavender were not the only ones hooting with
laughter now.
“D’you mind not offending the only people who believe me?”
Harry asked Hermione as they made their way into class.
“Oh, for heaven’s sake, Harry, you can do better than her,” said
Hermione. “Ginny’s told me all about her, apparently she’ll only believe in things as long as there’s no proof at all. Well, I wouldn’t expect
anything else from someone whose father runs The Quibbler.”
Harry thought of the sinister winged horses he had seen on the
night he had arrived and how Luna had said she could see them too.
His spirits sank slightly. Had she been lying? But before he could devote much more thought to the matter, Ernie Macmillan had stepped
up to him.
“I want you to know, Potter,” he said in a loud, carrying voice, “that
it’s not only weirdos who support you. I personally believe you one
hundred percent. My family have always stood firm behind Dumbledore, and so do I.”
“Er — thanks very much, Ernie,” said Harry, taken aback but
pleased. Ernie might be pompous on occasions like these, but Harry
was in a mood to deeply appreciate a vote of confidence from somebody who was not wearing radishes in their ears. Ernie’s words had
certainly wiped the smile from Lavender Brown’s face and, as he

turned to talk to Ron and Hermione, Harry caught Seamus’s expression, which looked both confused and defiant.
To nobody’s surprise, Professor Sprout started their lesson by lecturing them about the importance of O.W.L.s. Harry wished all the
teachers would stop doing this; he was starting to get an anxious,
twisted feeling in his stomach every time he remembered how much
homework he had to do, a feeling that worsened dramatically when
Professor Sprout gave them yet another essay at the end of class. Tired
and smelling strongly of dragon dung, Professor Sprout’s preferred
brand of fertilizer, the Gryffindors trooped back up to the castle an
hour and a half later, none of them talking very much; it had been another long day.
As Harry was starving, and he had his first detention with Umbridge at five o’clock, he headed straight for dinner without dropping
off his bag in Gryffindor Tower so that he could bolt something down
before facing whatever she had in store for him. He had barely reached
the entrance of the Great Hall, however, when a loud and angry voice
said, “Oy, Potter!”
“What now?” he muttered wearily, turning to face Angelina Johnson, who looked as though she was in a towering temper.
“I’ll tell you what now,” she said, marching straight up to him and
poking him hard in the chest with her finger. “How come you’ve
landed yourself in detention for five o’clock on Friday?”
“What?” said Harry. “Why . . . oh yeah, Keeper tryouts!”
“Now he remembers!” snarled Angelina. “Didn’t I tell you I wanted
to do a tryout with the whole team, and find someone who fitted in
with everyone? Didn’t I tell you I’d booked the Quidditch pitch specially? And now you’ve decided you’re not going to be there!”
“I didn’t decide not to be there!” said Harry, stung by the injustice
of these words. “I got detention from that Umbridge woman, just because I told her the truth about You-Know-Who —”


263



CHAPTER THIRTEEN
“Well, you can just go straight to her and ask her to let you off on
Friday,” said Angelina fiercely, “and I don’t care how you do it, tell her
You-Know-Who’s a figment of your imagination if you like, just make
sure you’re there!”
She stormed away.
“You know what?” Harry said to Ron and Hermione as they entered the Great Hall. “I think we’d better check with Puddlemere
United whether Oliver Wood’s been killed during a training session,
because she seems to be channeling his spirit.”
“What d’you reckon are the odds of Umbridge letting you off on
Friday?” said Ron skeptically, as they sat down at the Gryffindor table.
“Less than zero,” said Harry glumly, tipping lamb chops onto his
plate and starting to eat. “Better try, though, hadn’t I? I’ll offer to do
two more detentions or something, I dunno. . . .” He swallowed a
mouthful of potato and added, “I hope she doesn’t keep me too long
this evening. You realize we’ve got to write three essays, practice Vanishing Spells for McGonagall, work out a countercharm for Flitwick,
finish the bowtruckle drawing, and start that stupid dream diary for
Trelawney?”
Ron moaned and for some reason glanced up at the ceiling.
“And it looks like it’s going to rain.”
“What’s that got to do with our homework?” said Hermione, her
eyebrows raised.
“Nothing,” said Ron at once, his ears reddening.
At five to five Harry bade the other two good-bye and set off for
Umbridge’s office on the third floor. When he knocked on the door
she said, “Come in,” in a sugary voice. He entered cautiously, looking
around.
He had known this office under three of its previous occupants. In
the days when Gilderoy Lockhart had lived here it had been plastered
in beaming portraits of its owner. When Lupin had occupied it, it was
likely you would meet some fascinating Dark creature in a cage or

tank if you came to call. In the impostor Moody’s days it had been
packed with various instruments and artifacts for the detection of
wrongdoing and concealment.
Now, however, it looked totally unrecognizable. The surfaces had
all been draped in lacy covers and cloths. There were several vases full
of dried flowers, each residing on its own doily, and on one of the
walls was a collection of ornamental plates, each decorated with a
large technicolor kitten wearing a different bow around its neck.
These were so foul that Harry stared at them, transfixed, until Professor Umbridge spoke again.
“Good evening, Mr. Potter.”
Harry started and looked around. He had not noticed her at first
because she was wearing a luridly flowered set of robes that blended
only too well with the tablecloth on the desk behind her.
“Evening,” Harry said stiffly.
“Well, sit down,” she said, pointing toward a small table draped in
lace beside which she had drawn up a straight-backed chair. A piece of
blank parchment lay on the table, apparently waiting for him.
“Er,” said Harry, without moving. “Professor Umbridge? Er —
before we start, I-I wanted to ask you a . . . a favor.”
Her bulging eyes narrowed.
“Oh yes?”
“Well I’m . . . I’m on the Gryffindor Quidditch team. And I was
supposed to be at the tryouts for the new Keeper at five o’clock on Friday and I was — was wondering whether I could skip detention that
night and do it — do it another night . . . instead . . .”
He knew long before he reached the end of his sentence that it was
no good.
“Oh no,” said Umbridge, smiling so widely that she looked as
though she had just swallowed a particularly juicy fly. “Oh no, no, no.
This is your punishment for spreading evil, nasty, attention-seeking
stories, Mr. Potter, and punishments certainly cannot be adjusted to

suit the guilty one’s convenience. No, you will come here at five
o’clock tomorrow, and the next day, and on Friday too, and you will
do your detentions as planned. I think it rather a good thing that you
are missing something you really want to do. It ought to reinforce the
lesson I am trying to teach you.”
Harry felt the blood surge to his head and heard a thumping noise
in his ears. So he told evil, nasty, attention-seeking stories, did he?
She was watching him with her head slightly to one side, still smiling widely, as though she knew exactly what he was thinking and was
waiting to see whether he would start shouting again. With a massive
effort Harry looked away from her, dropped his schoolbag beside the
straight-backed chair, and sat down.
“There,” said Umbridge sweetly, “we’re getting better at controlling
our temper already, aren’t we? Now, you are going to be doing some
lines for me, Mr. Potter. No, not with your quill,” she added, as Harry
bent down to open his bag. “You’re going to be using a rather special
one of mine. Here you are.”
She handed him a long, thin black quill with an unusually sharp
point.
“I want you to write ‘I must not tell lies,’ ” she told him softly.
“How many times?” Harry asked, with a creditable imitation of
politeness.
“Oh, as long as it takes for the message to sink in,” said Umbridge
sweetly. “Off you go.”
She moved over to her desk, sat down, and bent over a stack of
parchment that looked like essays for marking. Harry raised the sharp
black quill and then realized what was missing.
“You haven’t given me any ink,” he said.
“Oh, you won’t need ink,” said Professor Umbridge with the merest suggestion of a laugh in her voice.
Harry placed the point of the quill on the paper and wrote: I must
not tell lies.


He let out a gasp of pain. The words had appeared on the parchment in what appeared to be shining red ink. At the same time, the
words had appeared on the back of Harry’s right hand, cut into his
skin as though traced there by a scalpel — yet even as he stared at the
shining cut, the skin healed over again, leaving the place where it had
been slightly redder than before but quite smooth.
Harry looked around at Umbridge. She was watching him, her
wide, toadlike mouth stretched in a smile.
“Yes?”
“Nothing,” said Harry quietly.
He looked back at the parchment, placed the quill upon it once
more, wrote I must not tell lies, and felt the searing pain on the back of
his hand for a second time; once again the words had been cut into his
skin, once again they healed over seconds later.
And on it went. Again and again Harry wrote the words on the
parchment in what he soon came to realize was not ink, but his own
blood. And again and again the words were cut into the back of his
hand, healed, and then reappeared the next time he set quill to
parchment.
Darkness fell outside Umbridge’s window. Harry did not ask when
he would be allowed to stop. He did not even check his watch. He
knew she was watching him for signs of weakness and he was not going to show any, not even if he had to sit here all night, cutting open
his own hand with this quill. . . .
“Come here,” she said, after what seemed hours.
He stood up. His hand was stinging painfully. When he looked
down at it he saw that the cut had healed, but that the skin there was
red raw.
“Hand,” she said.
He extended it. She took it in her own. Harry repressed a shudder
as she touched him with her thick, stubby fingers on which she wore
a number of ugly old rings.


CHAPTER THIRTEEN
“Tut, tut, I don’t seem to have made much of an impression yet,”
she said, smiling. “Well, we’ll just have to try again tomorrow
evening, won’t we? You may go.”
Harry left her office without a word. The school was quite deserted;
it was surely past midnight. He walked slowly up the corridor then,
when he had turned the corner and was sure that she would not hear
him, broke into a run.
He had not had time to practice Vanishing Spells, had not written a
single dream in his dream diary, and had not finished the drawing of
the bowtruckle, nor had he written his essays. He skipped breakfast
next morning to scribble down a couple of made-up dreams for Divination, their first lesson, and was surprised to find a disheveled Ron
keeping him company.
“How come you didn’t do it last night?” Harry asked, as Ron stared
wildly around the common room for inspiration. Ron, who had been
fast asleep when Harry got back to the dormitory, muttered something about “doing other stuff,” bent low over his parchment, and
scrawled a few words.
“That’ll have to do,” he said, slamming the diary shut, “I’ve said I
dreamed I was buying a new pair of shoes, she can’t make anything
weird out of that, can she?”
They hurried off to North Tower together.
“How was detention with Umbridge, anyway? What did she make
you do?”
Harry hesitated for a fraction of a second, then said, “Lines.”
“That’s not too bad, then, eh?” said Ron.
“Nope,” said Harry.
“Hey — I forgot — did she let you off for Friday?”
“No,” said Harry.
Ron groaned sympathetically.
It was another bad day for Harry; he was one of the worst in Trans

figuration, not having practiced Vanishing Spells at all. He had to give
up his lunch hour to complete the picture of the bowtruckle, and
meanwhile, Professors McGonagall, Grubbly-Plank, and Sinistra gave
them yet more homework, which he had no prospect of finishing that
evening because of his second detention with Umbridge. To cap it all,
Angelina Johnson tracked him down at dinner again and, on learning
that he would not be able to attend Friday’s Keeper tryouts, told him
she was not at all impressed by his attitude and that she expected players who wished to remain on the team to put training before their
other commitments.
“I’m in detention!” Harry yelled after her as she stalked away.
“D’you think I’d rather be stuck in a room with that old toad or playing Quidditch?”
“At least it’s only lines,” said Hermione consolingly, as Harry sank
back onto his bench and looked down at his steak-and-kidney pie,
which he no longer fancied very much. “It’s not as if it’s a dreadful
punishment, really. . . .”
Harry opened his mouth, closed it again, and nodded. He was not
really sure why he was not telling Ron and Hermione exactly what was
happening in Umbridge’s room: He only knew that he did not want
to see their looks of horror; that would make the whole thing seem
worse and therefore more difficult to face. He also felt dimly that this
was between himself and Umbridge, a private battle of wills, and he
was not going to give her the satisfaction of hearing that he had complained about it.
“I can’t believe how much homework we’ve got,” said Ron
miserably.
“Well, why didn’t you do any last night?” Hermione asked him.
“Where were you anyway?”
“I was . . . I fancied a walk,” said Ron shiftily.
Harry had the distinct impression that he was not alone in concealing things at the moment.


The second detention was just as bad as the previous one. The skin on
the back of Harry’s hand became irritated more quickly now, red and
inflamed; Harry thought it unlikely to keep healing as effectively for
long. Soon the cut would remain etched in his hand and Umbridge
would, perhaps, be satisfied. He let no moan of pain escape him, however, and from the moment of entering the room to the moment of his
dismissal, again past midnight, he said nothing but “Good evening”
and “Good night.”
His homework situation, however, was now desperate, and when
he returned to the Gryffindor common room he did not, though exhausted, go to bed, but opened his books and began Snape’s moonstone essay. It was half-past two by the time he had finished it. He
knew he had done a poor job, but there was no help for it; unless he
had something to give in he would be in detention with Snape next.
He then dashed off answers to the questions Professor McGonagall
had set them, cobbled together something on the proper handling of
bowtruckles for Professor Grubbly-Plank, and staggered up to bed,
where he fell fully clothed on top of the bed covers and fell asleep
immediately.
Thursday passed in a haze of tiredness. Ron seemed very sleepy too,
though Harry could not see why he should be. Harry’s third detention
passed in the same way as the previous two, except that after two
hours the words “I must not tell lies” did not fade from the back of
Harry’s hand, but remained scratched there, oozing droplets of blood.
The pause in the pointed quill’s scratching made Professor Umbridge
look up.
“Ah,” she said softly, moving around her desk to examine his hand
herself. “Good. That ought to serve as a reminder to you, oughtn’t it?
You may leave for tonight.”


“Do I still have to come back tomorrow?” said Harry, picking up
his schoolbag with his left hand rather than his smarting right.
“Oh yes,” said Professor Umbridge, smiling widely as before. “Yes,
I think we can etch the message a little deeper with another evening’s
work.”
He had never before considered the possibility that there might be
another teacher in the world he hated more than Snape, but as he
walked back toward Gryffindor Tower he had to admit he had found
a contender. She’s evil, he thought, as he climbed a staircase to the seventh floor, she’s an evil, twisted, mad, old —
“Ron?”
He had reached the top of the stairs, turned right, and almost
walked into Ron, who was lurking behind a statue of Lachlan the
Lanky, clutching his broomstick. He gave a great leap of surprise
when he saw Harry and attempted to hide his new Cleansweep Eleven
behind his back.
“What are you doing?”
“Er — nothing. What are you doing?”
Harry frowned at him.
“Come on, you can tell me! What are you hiding here for?”
“I’m — I’m hiding from Fred and George, if you must know,” said
Ron. “They just went past with a bunch of first years, I bet they’re
testing stuff on them again, I mean, they can’t do it in the common
room now, can they, not with Hermione there.”
He was talking in a very fast, feverish way.
“But what have you got your broom for, you haven’t been flying,
have you?” Harry asked.
“I — well — well, okay, I’ll tell you, but don’t laugh, all right?” Ron
said defensively, turning redder with every second. “I-I thought I’d try
out for Gryffindor Keeper now I’ve got a decent broom. There. Go on.
Laugh.”


271



CHAPTER THIRTEEN
“I’m not laughing,” said Harry. Ron blinked. “It’s a brilliant idea!
It’d be really cool if you got on the team! I’ve never seen you play
Keeper, are you good?”
“I’m not bad,” said Ron, who looked immensely relieved at Harry’s
reaction. “Charlie, Fred, and George always made me Keep for them
when they were training during the holidays.”
“So you’ve been practicing tonight?”
“Every evening since Tuesday . . . just on my own, though, I’ve
been trying to bewitch Quaffles to fly at me, but it hasn’t been easy
and I don’t know how much use it’ll be.” Ron looked nervous and
anxious. “Fred and George are going to laugh themselves stupid when
I turn up for the tryouts. They haven’t stopped taking the mickey out
of me since I got made a prefect.”
“I wish I was going to be there,” said Harry bitterly, as they set off
together toward the common room.
“Yeah, so do — Harry, what’s that on the back of your hand?”
Harry, who had just scratched his nose with his free right hand,
tried to hide it, but had as much success as Ron with his Cleansweep.
“It’s just a cut — it’s nothing — it’s —”
But Ron had grabbed Harry’s forearm and pulled the back of
Harry’s hand up level with his eyes. There was a pause, during which
he stared at the words carved into the skin, then he released Harry,
looking sick.
“I thought you said she was giving you lines?”
Harry hesitated, but after all, Ron had been honest with him, so he
told Ron the truth about the hours he had been spending in Umbridge’s office.
“The old hag!” Ron said in a revolted whisper as they came to a halt
in front of the Fat Lady, who was dozing peacefully with her head
against her frame. “She’s sick! Go to McGonagall, say something!”
“No,” said Harry at once. “I’m not giving her the satisfaction of
knowing she’s got to me.”


“Got to you? You can’t let her get away with this!”
“I don’t know how much power McGonagall’s got over her,” said
Harry.
“Dumbledore, then, tell Dumbledore!”
“No,” said Harry flatly.
“Why not?”
“He’s got enough on his mind,” said Harry, but that was not the
true reason. He was not going to go to Dumbledore for help when
Dumbledore had not spoken to him once since last June.
“Well, I reckon you should —” Ron began, but he was interrupted
by the Fat Lady, who had been watching them sleepily and now burst
out, “Are you going to give me the password or will I have to stay
awake all night waiting for you to finish your conversation?”
Friday dawned sullen and sodden as the rest of the week. Though
Harry glanced toward the staff table automatically when he entered
the Great Hall, it was without real hope of seeing Hagrid and he
turned his mind immediately to his more pressing problems, such as
the mountainous pile of homework he had to do and the prospect of
yet another detention with Umbridge.
Two things sustained Harry that day. One was the thought that it
was almost the weekend; the other was that, dreadful though his final
detention with Umbridge was sure to be, he had a distant view of the
Quidditch pitch from her window and might, with luck, be able to
see something of Ron’s tryout. These were rather feeble rays of light, it
was true, but Harry was grateful for anything that might lighten his
present darkness; he had never had a worse first week of term at
Hogwarts.
At five o’clock that evening he knocked on Professor Umbridge’s
office door for what he sincerely hoped would be the final time, was
told to enter and did so. The blank parchment lay ready for him on
the lace-covered table, the pointed black quill beside it.


273



CHAPTER THIRTEEN
“You know what to do, Mr. Potter,” said Umbridge, smiling
sweetly over at him.
Harry picked up the quill and glanced through the window. If he
just shifted his chair an inch or so to the right . . . On the pretext of
shifting himself closer to the table he managed it. He now had a distant view of the Gryffindor Quidditch team soaring up and down the
pitch, while half a dozen black figures stood at the foot of the three
high goalposts, apparently awaiting their turn to Keep. It was impossible to tell which one was Ron at this distance.
I must not tell lies, Harry wrote. The cut in the back of his right
hand opened and began to bleed afresh.
I must not tell lies. The cut dug deeper, stinging and smarting.
I must not tell lies. Blood trickled down his wrist.
He chanced another glance out of the window. Whoever was defending the goalposts now was doing a very poor job indeed. Katie
Bell scored twice in the few seconds Harry dared watch. Hoping very
much that the Keeper wasn’t Ron, he dropped his eyes back to the
parchment dotted with blood.
I must not tell lies.
I must not tell lies.
He looked up whenever he thought he could risk it, when he could
hear the scratching of Umbridge’s quill or the opening of a desk
drawer. The third person to try out was pretty good, the fourth was
terrible, the fifth dodged a Bludger exceptionally well but then fumbled an easy save. The sky was darkening so that Harry doubted he
would be able to watch the sixth and seventh people at all.
I must not tell lies.
I must not tell lies.
The parchment was now shining with drops of blood from the back
of his hand, which was searing with pain. When he next looked up,
night had fallen and the Quidditch pitch was no longer visible.

“Let’s see if you’ve gotten the message yet, shall we?” said Umbridge’s soft voice half an hour later.
She moved toward him, stretching out her short be-ringed fingers
for his arm. And then, as she took hold of him to examine the words
now cut into his skin, pain seared, not across the back of his hand, but
across the scar on his forehead. At the same time, he had a most peculiar sensation somewhere around his midriff.
He wrenched his arm out of her grip and leapt to his feet, staring at
her. She looked back at him, a smile stretching her wide, slack mouth.
“Yes, it hurts, doesn’t it?” she said softly.
He did not answer. His heart was thumping very hard and fast. Was
she talking about his hand or did she know what he had just felt in his
forehead?
“Well, I think I’ve made my point, Mr. Potter. You may go.”
He caught up his schoolbag and left the room as quickly as he
could.
Stay calm, he told himself as he sprinted up the stairs. Stay calm, it
doesn’t necessarily mean what you think it means. . . .
“Mimbulus mimbletonia!” he gasped at the Fat Lady, who swung
forward once more.
A roar of sound greeted him. Ron came running toward him,
beaming all over his face and slopping butterbeer down his front from
the goblet he was clutching.
“Harry, I did it, I’m in, I’m Keeper!”
“What? Oh — brilliant!” said Harry, trying to smile naturally,
while his heart continued to race and his hand throbbed and bled.
“Have a butterbeer.” Ron pressed a bottle onto him. “I can’t believe
it — where’s Hermione gone?”
“She’s there,” said Fred, who was also swigging butterbeer, and
pointed to an armchair by the fire. Hermione was dozing in it, her
drink tipping precariously in her hand.

“Well, she said she was pleased when I told her,” said Ron, looking
slightly put out.
“Let her sleep,” said George hastily. It was a few moments before
Harry noticed that several of the first years gathered around them bore
unmistakable signs of recent nosebleeds.
“Come here, Ron, and see if Oliver’s old robes fit you,” called Katie
Bell. “We can take off his name and put yours on instead. . . .”
As Ron moved away, Angelina came striding up to Harry.
“Sorry I was a bit short with you earlier, Potter,” she said abruptly.
“It’s stressful, this managing lark, you know, I’m starting to think I
was a bit hard on Wood sometimes.” She was watching Ron over the
rim of her goblet with a slight frown on her face.
“Look, I know he’s your best mate, but he’s not fabulous,” she said
bluntly. “I think with a bit of training he’ll be all right, though. He
comes from a family of good Quidditch players. I’m banking on him
turning out to have a bit more talent than he showed today, to
be honest. Vicky Frobisher and Geoffrey Hooper both flew better
this evening, but Hooper’s a real whiner, he’s always moaning about
something or other, and Vicky’s involved in all sorts of societies, she
admitted herself that if training clashed with her Charm Club she’d
put Charms first. Anyway, we’re having a practice session at two
o’clock tomorrow, so just make sure you’re there this time. And do me
a favor and help Ron as much as you can, okay?”
He nodded and Angelina strolled back to Alicia Spinnet. Harry
moved over to sit next to Hermione, who awoke with a jerk as he put
down his bag.
“Oh, Harry, it’s you. . . . Good about Ron, isn’t it?” she said
blearily. “I’m just so — so — so tired,” she yawned. “I was up until
one o’clock making more hats. They’re disappearing like mad!”
And sure enough, now that he looked, Harry saw that there were
woolly hats concealed all around the room where unwary elves might
accidentally pick them up.

DETENTION WITH
DOLORES
“Great,” said Harry distractedly; if he did not tell somebody soon,
he would burst. “Listen, Hermione, I was just up in Umbridge’s office
and she touched my arm . . .”
Hermione listened closely. When Harry had finished she said
slowly, “You’re worried that You-Know-Who’s controlling her like he
controlled Quirrell?”
“Well,” said Harry, dropping his voice, “it’s a possibility, isn’t it?”
“I suppose so,” said Hermione, though she sounded unconvinced.
“But I don’t think he can be possessing her the way he possessed Quirrell, I mean, he’s properly alive again now, isn’t he, he’s got his own
body, he wouldn’t need to share someone else’s. He could have her under the Imperius Curse, I suppose. . . .”
Harry watched Fred, George, and Lee Jordan juggling empty butterbeer bottles for a moment. Then Hermione said, “But last year
your scar hurt when nobody was touching you, and didn’t Dumbledore say it had to do with what You-Know-Who was feeling at the
time? I mean, maybe this hasn’t got anything to do with Umbridge at
all, maybe it’s just coincidence it happened while you were with her?”
“She’s evil,” said Harry flatly. “Twisted.”
“She’s horrible, yes, but . . . Harry, I think you ought to tell Dumbledore your scar hurt.”
It was the second time in two days he had been advised to go to
Dumbledore and his answer to Hermione was just the same as his answer to Ron.
“I’m not bothering him with this. Like you just said, it’s not a big
deal. It’s been hurting on and off all summer — it was just a bit worse
tonight, that’s all —”
“Harry, I’m sure Dumbledore would want to be bothered by
this —”
“Yeah,” said Harry, before he could stop himself, “that’s the only bit
of me Dumbledore cares about, isn’t it, my scar?”
“Don’t say that, it’s not true!”

“I think I’ll write and tell Sirius about it, see what he thinks —”
“Harry, you can’t put something like that in a letter!” said
Hermione, looking alarmed. “Don’t you remember, Moody told us to
be careful what we put in writing! We just can’t guarantee owls aren’t
being intercepted anymore!”
“All right, all right, I won’t tell him, then!” said Harry irritably. He
got to his feet. “I’m going to bed. Tell Ron for me, will you?”
“Oh no,” said Hermione, looking relieved, “if you’re going that
means I can go without being rude too, I’m absolutely exhausted and
I want to make some more hats tomorrow. Listen, you can help me if
you like, it’s quite fun, I’m getting better, I can do patterns and bobbles and all sorts of things now.”
Harry looked into her face, which was shining with glee, and tried
to look as though he was vaguely tempted by this offer.
“Er . . . no, I don’t think I will, thanks,” he said. “Er — not tomorrow. I’ve got loads of homework to do. . . .”
And he traipsed off to the boys’ stairs, leaving her looking slightly
disappointed behind him.

PERCY AND PADFOOT

H

arry was the first to awake in his dormitory next morning.
He lay for a moment watching dust swirl in the chink of
sunlight falling through the gap in his four-poster’s hangings and savored the thought that it was Saturday. The first week of term seemed
to have dragged on forever, like one gigantic History of Magic lesson.
Judging by the sleepy silence and the freshly minted look of that
beam of sunlight, it was just after daybreak. He pulled open the curtains around his bed, got up, and started to dress. The only sound
apart from the distant twittering of birds was the slow, deep breathing
of his fellow Gryffindors. He opened his schoolbag carefully, pulled
out parchment and quill, and headed out of the dormitory for the
common room.
Making straight for his favorite squashy old armchair beside the
now extinct fire, Harry settled himself down comfortably and unrolled his parchment while looking around the room. The detritus of
crumpled-up bits of parchment, old Gobstones, empty ingredient jars,
and candy wrappers that usually covered the common room at the
end of each day was gone, as were all Hermione’s elf hats. Wondering


CHAPTER FOURTEEN
vaguely how many elves had now been set free whether they wanted
to be or not, Harry uncorked his ink bottle, dipped his quill into it,
and then held it suspended an inch above the smooth yellowish surface of his parchment, thinking hard. . . . But after a minute or so he
found himself staring into the empty grate, at a complete loss for what
to say.
He could now appreciate how hard it had been for Ron and
Hermione to write him letters over the summer. How was he supposed to tell Sirius everything that had happened over the past week
and pose all the questions he was burning to ask without giving potential letter-thieves a lot of information he did not want them to
have?
He sat quite motionless for a while, gazing into the fireplace, then,
finally coming to a decision, he dipped his quill into the ink bottle
once more and set it resolutely upon the parchment.
Dear Snuffles,
Hope you’re okay, the first week back here’s been terrible, I’m
really glad it’s the weekend.
We’ve got a new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher, Professor Umbridge. She’s nearly as nice as your mum. I’m writing
because that thing I wrote to you about last summer happened
again last night when I was doing a detention with Umbridge.
We’re all missing our biggest friend, we hope he’ll be back soon.
Please write back quickly.
Best,

Harry reread this letter several times, trying to see it from the point
of view of an outsider. He could not see how they would know what
he was talking about — or who he was talking to — just from reading


280



PERCY AND PADFOOT
this letter. He did hope Sirius would pick up the hint about Hagrid
and tell them when he might be back: Harry did not want to ask directly in case it drew too much attention to what Hagrid might be up
to while he was not at Hogwarts.
Considering it was a very short letter it had taken a long time to
write; sunlight had crept halfway across the room while he had been
working on it, and he could now hear distant sounds of movement
from the dormitories above. Sealing the parchment carefully he
climbed through the portrait hole and headed off for the Owlery.
“I would not go that way if I were you,” said Nearly Headless Nick,
drifting disconcertingly through a wall just ahead of him as he walked
down the passage. “Peeves is planning an amusing joke on the next
person to pass the bust of Paracelsus halfway down the corridor.”
“Does it involve Paracelsus falling on top of the person’s head?”
asked Harry.
“Funnily enough, it does,” said Nearly Headless Nick in a bored
voice. “Subtlety has never been Peeves’s strong point. I’m off to try
and find the Bloody Baron. . . . He might be able to put a stop to it.
. . . See you, Harry. . . .”
“Yeah, ’bye,” said Harry and instead of turning right, he turned left,
taking a longer but safer route up to the Owlery. His spirits rose as he
walked past window after window showing brilliantly blue sky; he had
training later, he would be back on the Quidditch pitch at last —
Something brushed his ankles. He looked down and saw the caretaker’s skeletal gray cat, Mrs. Norris, slinking past him. She turned
lamplike yellow eyes upon him for a moment before disappearing behind a statue of Wilfred the Wistful.
“I’m not doing anything wrong,” Harry called after her. She had
the unmistakable air of a cat that was off to report to her boss, yet
Harry could not see why; he was perfectly entitled to walk up to the
Owlery on a Saturday morning.
The sun was high in the sky now and when Harry entered the


281



CHAPTER FOURTEEN
Owlery the glassless windows dazzled his eyes; thick silvery beams of
sunlight crisscrossed the circular room in which hundreds of owls nestled on rafters, a little restless in the early morning light, some clearly
just returned from hunting. The straw-covered floor crunched a little
as he stepped across tiny animal bones, craning his neck for a sight of
Hedwig.
“There you are,” he said, spotting her somewhere near the very top
of the vaulted ceiling. “Get down here, I’ve got a letter for you.”
With a low hoot she stretched her great white wings and soared
down onto his shoulder.
“Right, I know this says ‘Snuffles’ on the outside,” he told her, giving her the letter to clasp in her beak and, without knowing exactly
why, whispering, “but it’s for Sirius, okay?”
She blinked her amber eyes once and he took that to mean that she
understood.
“Safe flight, then,” said Harry and he carried her to one of the windows; with a moment’s pressure on his arm Hedwig took off into the
blindingly bright sky. He watched her until she became a tiny black
speck and vanished, then switched his gaze to Hagrid’s hut, clearly visible from this window, and just as clearly uninhabited, the chimney
smokeless, the curtains drawn.
The treetops of the Forbidden Forest swayed in a light breeze.
Harry watched them, savoring the fresh air on his face, thinking about
Quidditch later . . . and then he saw it. A great, reptilian winged
horse, just like the ones pulling the Hogwarts carriages, with leathery
black wings spread wide like a pterodactyl’s, rose up out of the trees
like a grotesque, giant bird. It soared in a great circle and then plunged
once more into the trees. The whole thing had happened so quickly
Harry could hardly believe what he had seen, except that his heart was
hammering madly.
The Owlery door opened behind him. He leapt in shock, and turning quickly, saw Cho Chang holding a letter and a parcel in her hands.


PERCY AND PADFOOT
“Hi,” said Harry automatically.
“Oh . . . hi,” she said breathlessly. “I didn’t think anyone would be
up here this early. . . . I only remembered five minutes ago, it’s my
mum’s birthday.”
She held up the parcel.
“Right,” said Harry. His brain seemed to have jammed. He wanted
to say something funny and interesting, but the memory of that terrible winged horse was fresh in his mind.
“Nice day,” he said, gesturing to the windows. His insides seemed
to shrivel with embarrassment. The weather. He was talking about the
weather. . . .
“Yeah,” said Cho, looking around for a suitable owl. “Good Quidditch conditions. I haven’t been out all week, have you?”
“No,” said Harry.
Cho had selected one of the school barn owls. She coaxed it down
onto her arm where it held out an obliging leg so that she could attach
the parcel.
“Hey, has Gryffindor got a new Keeper yet?” she asked.
“Yeah,” said Harry. “It’s my friend Ron Weasley, d’you know him?”
“The Tornado-hater?” said Cho rather coolly. “Is he any good?”
“Yeah,” said Harry, “I think so. I didn’t see his tryout, though, I was
in detention.”
Cho looked up, the parcel only half-attached to the owl’s legs.
“That Umbridge woman’s foul,” she said in a low voice. “Putting
you in detention just because you told the truth about how — how
— how he died. Everyone heard about it, it was all over the school.
You were really brave standing up to her like that.”
Harry’s insides reinflated so rapidly he felt as though he might actually float a few inches off the dropping-strewn floor. Who cared
about a stupid flying horse, Cho thought he had been really brave. . . .
For a moment he considered accidentally-on-purpose showing her his
cut hand as he helped her tie her parcel onto her owl. . . . But the very


283

CHAPTER FOURTEEN
instant that this thrilling thought occurred, the Owlery door opened
again.
Filch, the caretaker, came wheezing into the room. There were purple patches on his sunken, veined cheeks, his jowls were aquiver and
his thin gray hair disheveled; he had obviously run here. Mrs. Norris
came trotting at his heels, gazing up at the owls overhead and mewing
hungrily. There was a restless shifting of wings from above, and a large
brown owl snapped his beak in a menacing fashion.
“Aha!” said Filch, taking a flat-footed step toward Harry, his
pouchy cheeks trembling with anger. “I’ve had a tip-off that you are
intending to place a massive order for Dungbombs!”
Harry folded his arms and stared at the caretaker.
“Who told you I was ordering Dungbombs?”
Cho was looking from Harry to Filch, also frowning; the barn owl
on her arm, tired of standing on one leg, gave an admonitory hoot but
she ignored it.
“I have my sources,” said Filch in a self-satisfied hiss. “Now hand
over whatever it is you’re sending.”
Feeling immensely thankful that he had not dawdled in posting off
the letter, Harry said, “I can’t, it’s gone.”
“Gone?” said Filch, his face contorting with rage.
“Gone,” said Harry calmly.
Filch opened his mouth furiously, mouthed for a few seconds, then
raked Harry’s robes with his eyes. “How do I know you haven’t got it
in your pocket?”
“Because —”
“I saw him send it,” said Cho angrily.
Filch rounded on her.
“You saw him — ?”
“That’s right, I saw him,” she said fiercely.
There was a moment’s pause in which Filch glared at Cho and Cho


PERCY AND PADFOOT
glared right back, then the caretaker turned and shuffled back toward
the door. He stopped with his hand on the handle and looked back at
Harry.
“If I get so much as a whiff of a Dungbomb . . .”
He stumped off down the stairs. Mrs. Norris cast a last longing
look at the owls and followed him.
Harry and Cho looked at each other.
“Thanks,” Harry said.
“No problem,” said Cho, finally fixing the parcel to the barn owl’s
other leg, her face slightly pink. “You weren’t ordering Dungbombs,
were you?”
“No,” said Harry.
“I wonder why he thought you were, then?” she said, as she carried
the owl to the window.
Harry shrugged; he was quite as mystified by that as she was,
though, oddly, it was not bothering him very much at the moment.
They left the Owlery together. At the entrance of a corridor that led
toward the west wing of the castle, Cho said, “I’m going this way.
Well, I’ll . . . I’ll see you around, Harry.”
“Yeah . . . see you.”
She smiled at him and departed. He walked on, feeling quietly
elated. He had managed to have an entire conversation with her and
not embarrassed himself once. . . . You were really brave standing up to
her like that. . . . She had called him brave. . . . She did not hate him
for being alive. . . .
Of course, she had preferred Cedric, he knew that. . . . Though if
he’d only asked her to the ball before Cedric had, things might have
turned out differently. . . . She had seemed sincerely sorry that she
had to refuse when Harry had asked her. . . .
“Morning,” Harry said brightly to Ron and Hermione, joining
them at the Gryffindor table in the Great Hall.


CHAPTER FOURTEEN
“What are you looking so pleased about?” said Ron, eyeing Harry
in surprise.
“Erm . . . Quidditch later,” said Harry happily, pulling a large platter of bacon and eggs toward him.
“Oh . . . yeah . . .” said Ron. He put down the bit of toast he was
eating and took a large swig of pumpkin juice. Then he said, “Listen
. . . you don’t fancy going out a bit earlier with me, do you? Just to —
er — give me some practice before training? So I can, you know, get
my eye in a bit . . .”
“Yeah, okay,” said Harry.
“Look, I don’t think you should,” said Hermione seriously, “you’re
both really behind on homework as it —”
But she broke off; the morning post was arriving and, as usual, the
Daily Prophet was soaring toward her in the beak of a screech owl,
which landed perilously close to the sugar bowl and held out a leg;
Hermione pushed a Knut into its leather pouch, took the newspaper,
and scanned the front page critically as the owl took off again.
“Anything interesting?” said Ron; Harry smiled — he knew Ron
was keen to get her off the subject of homework.
“No,” she sighed, “just some guff about the bass player in the
Weird Sisters getting married. . . .”
She opened the paper and disappeared behind it. Harry devoted
himself to another helping of eggs and bacon; Ron was staring up at
the high windows, looking slightly preoccupied.
“Wait a moment,” said Hermione suddenly. “Oh no . . . Sirius!”
“What’s happened?” said Harry, and he snatched at the paper so
violently that it ripped down the middle so that he and Hermione
were holding half each.
“ ‘The Ministry of Magic has received a tip-off from a reliable source
that Sirius Black, notorious mass murderer . . . blah blah blah . . . is currently hiding in London!’ ” Hermione read from her half in an anguished
whisper.


PERCY AND PADFOOT
“Lucius Malfoy, I’ll bet anything,” said Harry in a low, furious
voice. “He did recognize Sirius on the platform. . . .”
“What?” said Ron, looking alarmed. “You didn’t say —”
“Shh!” said the other two.
“. . . ‘Ministry warns Wizarding community that Black is very dangerous . . . killed thirteen people . . . broke out of Azkaban . . .’ the usual
rubbish,” Hermione concluded, laying down her half of the paper and
looking fearfully at Harry and Ron. “Well, he just won’t be able to
leave the house again, that’s all,” she whispered. “Dumbledore did
warn him not to.”
Harry looked down glumly at the bit of the Prophet he had torn off.
Most of the page was devoted to an advertisement for Madame
Malkin’s Robes for All Occasions, which was apparently having a sale.
“Hey!” he said, flattening it down so Hermione and Ron could
both see it. “Look at this!”
“I’ve got all the robes I want,” said Ron.
“No,” said Harry, “look . . . this little piece here . . .”
Ron and Hermione bent closer to read it; the item was barely an
inch long and placed right at the bottom of a column. It was headlined:

TRESPASS AT MINISTRY

Sturgis Podmore, 38, of number two, Laburnum
Gardens, Clapham, has appeared in front of the
Wizengamot charged with trespass and attempted
robbery at the Ministry of Magic on 31st August.
Podmore was arrested by Ministry of Magic watchwizard Eric Munch, who found him attempting to
force his way through a top-security door at one
o’clock in the morning. Podmore, who refused to
speak in his own defense, was convicted on both
charges and sentenced to six months in Azkaban.

CHAPTER FOURTEEN
“Sturgis Podmore?” said Ron slowly, “but he’s that bloke who looks
like his head’s been thatched, isn’t he? He’s one of the Ord —”
“Ron, shh!” said Hermione, casting a terrified look around them.
“Six months in Azkaban!” whispered Harry, shocked. “Just for trying to get through a door!”
“Don’t be silly, it wasn’t just for trying to get through a door —
what on earth was he doing at the Ministry of Magic at one o’clock in
the morning?” breathed Hermione.
“D’you reckon he was doing something for the Order?” Ron
muttered.
“Wait a moment. . . .” said Harry slowly. “Sturgis was supposed to
come and see us off, remember?”
The other two looked at him.
“Yeah, he was supposed to be part of our guard going to King’s
Cross, remember? And Moody was all annoyed because he didn’t turn
up, so that doesn’t seem like he was supposed to be on a job for them,
does it?”
“Well, maybe they didn’t expect him to get caught,” said
Hermione.
“It could be a frame-up!” Ron exclaimed excitedly. “No — listen!”
he went on, dropping his voice dramatically at the threatening look
on Hermione’s face. “The Ministry suspects he’s one of Dumbledore’s
lot so — I dunno — they lured him to the Ministry, and he wasn’t
trying to get through a door at all! Maybe they’ve just made something up to get him!”
There was a pause while Harry and Hermione considered this.
Harry thought it seemed far-fetched; Hermione, on the other hand,
looked rather impressed and said, “Do you know, I wouldn’t be at all
surprised if that were true.”
She folded up her half of the newspaper thoughtfully. When Harry
laid down his knife and fork she seemed to come out of a reverie.

“Right, well, I think we should tackle that essay for Sprout on SelfFertilizing Shrubs first, and if we’re lucky we’ll be able to start McGonagall’s Inanimatus Conjurus before lunch. . . .”
Harry felt a small twinge of guilt at the thought of the pile of
homework awaiting him upstairs, but the sky was a clear, exhilarating
blue, and he had not been on his Firebolt for a week. . . .
“I mean, we can do it tonight,” said Ron, as he and Harry walked
down the sloping lawns toward the Quidditch pitch, their broomsticks over their shoulders, Hermione’s dire warnings that they would
fail all their O.W.L.s still ringing in their ears. “And we’ve got tomorrow. She gets too worked up about work, that’s her trouble. . . .” There
was a pause and he added, in a slightly more anxious tone, “D’you
think she meant it when she said we weren’t copying from her?”
“Yeah, I do,” said Harry. “Still, this is important too, we’ve got to
practice if we want to stay on the Quidditch team. . . .”
“Yeah, that’s right,” said Ron in a heartened tone. “And we have got
plenty of time to do it all. . . .”
Harry glanced over to his right as they approached the Quidditch
pitch, to where the trees of the Forbidden Forest were swaying darkly.
Nothing flew out of them; the sky was empty but for a few distant
owls fluttering around the Owlery Tower. He had enough to worry
about; the flying horse wasn’t doing him any harm: He pushed it out
of his mind.
They collected balls from the cupboard in the changing room and
set to work, Ron guarding the three tall goalposts, Harry playing
Chaser and trying to get the Quaffle past Ron. Harry thought Ron
was pretty good; he blocked three-quarters of the goals Harry attempted to put past him and played better the longer they practiced.
After a couple of hours they returned to the school, where they ate
lunch, during which Hermione made it quite clear that she thought
they were irresponsible, then returned to the Quidditch pitch for the


CHAPTER FOURTEEN
real training session. All their teammates but Angelina were already in
the changing room when they entered.
“All right, Ron?” said George, winking at him.
“Yeah,” said Ron, who had become quieter and quieter all the way
down to the pitch.
“Ready to show us all up, Ickle Prefect?” said Fred, emerging
tousle-haired from the neck of his Quidditch robes, a slightly malicious grin on his face.
“Shut up,” said Ron, stony-faced, pulling on his own team robes
for the first time. They fitted him well considering they had been
Oliver Wood’s, who was rather broader in the shoulder.
“Okay everyone,” said Angelina, entering from the Captain’s office,
already changed. “Let’s get to it; Alicia and Fred, if you can just bring
the ball crate out for us. Oh, and there are a couple of people out there
watching but I want you to just ignore them, all right?”
Something in her would-be casual voice made Harry think he
might know who the uninvited spectators were, and sure enough,
when they left the changing room for the bright sunlight of the pitch
it was to a storm of catcalls and jeers from the Slytherin Quidditch
team and assorted hangers-on, who were grouped halfway up the
empty stands and whose voices echoed loudly around the stadium.
“What’s that Weasley’s riding?” Malfoy called in his sneering drawl.
“Why would anyone put a Flying Charm on a moldy old log like
that?”
Crabbe, Goyle, and Pansy Parkinson guffawed and shrieked with
laughter. Ron mounted his broom and kicked off from the ground
and Harry followed him, watching his ears turn red from behind.
“Ignore them,” he said, accelerating to catch up with Ron. “We’ll
see who’s laughing after we play them. . . .”
“Exactly the attitude I want, Harry,” said Angelina approvingly,
soaring around them with the Quaffle under her arm and slowing to
hover on the spot in front of her airborne team. “Okay everyone, we’re


290

PERCY AND PADFOOT
going to start with some passes just to warm up, the whole team
please —”
“Hey, Johnson, what’s with that hairstyle anyway?” shrieked Pansy
Parkinson from below. “Why would anyone want to look like they’ve
got worms coming out of their head?”
Angelina swept her long braided hair out of her face and said
calmly, “Spread out, then, and let’s see what we can do. . . .”
Harry reversed away from the others to the far side of the pitch.
Ron fell back toward the opposite goal. Angelina raised the Quaffle
with one hand and threw it hard to Fred, who passed to George, who
passed to Harry, who passed to Ron, who dropped it.
The Slytherins, led by Malfoy, roared and screamed with laughter.
Ron, who had pelted toward the ground to catch the Quaffle before it
landed, pulled out of the dive untidily, so that he slipped sideways on
his broom, and returned to playing height, blushing. Harry saw Fred
and George exchange looks, but uncharacteristically neither of them
said anything, for which he was grateful.
“Pass it on, Ron,” called Angelina, as though nothing had happened.
Ron threw the Quaffle to Alicia, who passed back to Harry, who
passed to George. . . .
“Hey, Potter, how’s your scar feeling?” called Malfoy. “Sure you
don’t need a lie-down? It must be, what, a whole week since you were
in the hospital wing, that’s a record for you, isn’t it?”
Fred passed to Angelina; she reverse passed to Harry, who had not
been expecting it, but caught it in the very tips of his fingers and
passed it quickly to Ron, who lunged for it and missed by inches.
“Come on now, Ron,” said Angelina crossly, as Ron dived for the
ground again, chasing the Quaffle. “Pay attention.”
It would have been hard to say whether Ron’s face or the Quaffle
was a deeper scarlet when he returned again to playing height. Malfoy
and the rest of the Slytherin team were howling with laughter.
On his third attempt, Ron caught the Quaffle; perhaps out of relief

he passed it on so enthusiastically that it soared straight through
Katie’s outstretched hands and hit her hard in the face.
“Sorry!” Ron groaned, zooming forward to see whether he had
done any damage.
“Get back in position, she’s fine!” barked Angelina. “But as you’re
passing to a teammate, do try not to knock her off her broom, won’t
you? We’ve got Bludgers for that!”
Katie’s nose was bleeding. Down below the Slytherins were stamping their feet and jeering. Fred and George converged on Katie.
“Here, take this,” Fred told her, handing her something small and
purple from out of his pocket. “It’ll clear it up in no time.”
“All right,” called Angelina, “Fred, George, go and get your bats
and a Bludger; Ron, get up to the goalposts, Harry, release the Snitch
when I say so. We’re going to aim for Ron’s goal, obviously.”
Harry zoomed off after the twins to fetch the Snitch.
“Ron’s making a right pig’s ear of things, isn’t he?” muttered
George, as the three of them landed at the crate containing the balls
and opened it to extract one of the Bludgers and the Snitch.
“He’s just nervous,” said Harry. “He was fine when I was practicing
with him this morning.”
“Yeah, well, I hope he hasn’t peaked too soon,” said Fred gloomily.
They returned to the air. When Angelina blew her whistle, Harry
released the Snitch and Fred and George let fly the Bludger; from that
moment on, Harry was barely aware of what the others were doing. It
was his job to recapture the tiny fluttering golden ball that was worth
a hundred and fifty points to the Seeker’s team and doing so required
enormous speed and skill. He accelerated, rolling and swerving in and
out of the Chasers, the warm autumn air whipping his face and the
distant yells of the Slytherins so much meaningless roaring in his ears.
. . . But too soon, the whistle brought him to a halt again.
“Stop — stop – STOP!” screamed Angelina. “Ron — you’re not
covering your middle post!”

Harry looked around at Ron, who was hovering in front of the lefthand hoop, leaving the other two completely unprotected.
“Oh . . . sorry . . .”
“You keep shifting around while you’re watching the Chasers!” said
Angelina. “Either stay in center position until you have to move to defend a hoop, or else circle the hoops, but don’t drift vaguely off to one
side, that’s how you let in the last three goals!”
“Sorry . . .” Ron repeated, his red face shining like a beacon against
the bright blue sky.
“And Katie, can’t you do something about that nosebleed?”
“It’s just getting worse!” said Katie thickly, attempting to stem the
flow with her sleeve.
Harry glanced around at Fred, who was looking anxious and checking his pockets. He saw Fred pull out something purple, examine it
for a second, and then look around at Katie, evidently horrorstruck.
“Well, let’s try again,” said Angelina. She was ignoring the Slytherins, who had now set up a chant of “Gryffindor are losers, Gryffindor
are losers,” but there was a certain rigidity about her seat on the broom
nevertheless.
This time they had been flying for barely three minutes when
Angelina’s whistle sounded. Harry, who had just sighted the Snitch
circling the opposite goalpost, pulled up feeling distinctly aggrieved.
“What now?” he said impatiently to Alicia, who was nearest.
“Katie,” she said shortly.
Harry turned and saw Angelina, Fred, and George all flying as fast
as they could toward Katie. Harry and Alicia sped toward her too. It
was plain that Angelina had stopped training just in time; Katie was
now chalk-white and covered in blood.
“She needs the hospital wing,” said Angelina.
“We’ll take her,” said Fred. “She — er — might have swallowed a
Blood Blisterpod by mistake —”
“Well, there’s no point continuing with no Beaters and a Chaser

CHAPTER FOURTEEN
gone,” said Angelina glumly, as Fred and George zoomed off toward
the castle supporting Katie between them. “Come on, let’s go and get
changed.”
The Slytherins continued to chant as they trailed back into the
changing rooms.
“How was practice?” asked Hermione rather coolly half an hour
later, as Harry and Ron climbed through the portrait hole into the
Gryffindor common room.
“It was —” Harry began.
“Completely lousy,” said Ron in a hollow voice, sinking into a chair
beside Hermione. She looked up at Ron and her frostiness seemed to
melt.
“Well, it was only your first one,” she said consolingly, “it’s bound
to take time to —”
“Who said it was me who made it lousy?” snapped Ron.
“No one,” said Hermione, looking taken aback, “I thought —”
“You thought I was bound to be rubbish?”
“No, of course I didn’t! Look, you said it was lousy so I just —”
“I’m going to get started on some homework,” said Ron angrily
and stomped off to the staircase to the boys’ dormitories and vanished
from sight. Hermione turned to Harry.
“Was he lousy?”
“No,” said Harry loyally.
Hermione raised her eyebrows.
“Well, I suppose he could’ve played better,” Harry muttered, “but
it was only the first training session, like you said. . . .”
Neither Harry nor Ron seemed to make much headway with their
homework that night. Harry knew Ron was too preoccupied with
how badly he had performed at Quidditch practice and he himself
was having difficulty in getting the chant of “Gryffindor are losers” out
of his head.
They spent the whole of Sunday in the common room, buried in


294



PERCY AND PADFOOT
their books while the room around them filled up, then emptied: It
was another clear, fine day and most of their fellow Gryffindors spent
the day out in the grounds, enjoying what might well be some of the
last sunshine that year. By the evening Harry felt as though somebody
had been beating his brain against the inside of his skull.
“You know, we probably should try and get more homework done
during the week,” Harry muttered to Ron, as they finally laid aside
Professor McGonagall’s long essay on the Inanimatus Conjurus spell
and turned miserably to Professor Sinistra’s equally long and difficult
essay about Jupiter’s moons.
“Yeah,” said Ron, rubbing slightly bloodshot eyes and throwing his
fifth spoiled bit of parchment into the fire beside them. “Listen . . .
shall we just ask Hermione if we can have a look at what she’s done?”
Harry glanced over at her; she was sitting with Crookshanks on her
lap and chatting merrily to Ginny as a pair of knitting needles flashed
in midair in front of her, now knitting a pair of shapeless elf socks.
“No,” he said heavily, “you know she won’t let us.”
And so they worked on while the sky outside the windows became
steadily darker; slowly, the crowd in the common room began to thin
again. At half-past eleven, Hermione wandered over to them,
yawning.
“Nearly done?”
“No,” said Ron shortly.
“Jupiter’s biggest moon is Ganymede, not Callisto,” she said,
pointing over Ron’s shoulder at a line in his Astronomy essay, “and it’s
Io that’s got the volcanos.”
“Thanks,” snarled Ron, scratching out the offending sentences.
“Sorry, I only —”
“Yeah, well, if you’ve just come over here to criticize —”
“Ron —”
“I haven’t got time to listen to a sermon, all right, Hermione, I’m
up to my neck in it here —”

CHAPTER FOURTEEN
“No — look!”
Hermione was pointing to the nearest window. Harry and Ron
both looked over. A handsome screech owl was standing on the windowsill, gazing into the room at Ron.
“Isn’t that Hermes?” said Hermione, sounding amazed.
“Blimey, it is!” said Ron quietly, throwing down his quill and getting to his feet. “What’s Percy writing to me for?”
He crossed to the window and opened it; Hermes flew inside,
landed upon Ron’s essay, and held out a leg to which a letter was attached. Ron took it off and the owl departed at once, leaving inky
footprints across Ron’s drawing of the moon Io.
“That’s definitely Percy’s handwriting,” said Ron, sinking back into
his chair and staring at the words on the outside of the scroll: To
Ronald Weasley, Gryffindor House, Hogwarts. He looked up at the other
two. “What d’you reckon?”
“Open it!” said Hermione eagerly. Harry nodded.
Ron unrolled the scroll and began to read. The farther down the
parchment his eyes traveled, the more pronounced became his scowl.
When he had finished reading, he looked disgusted. He thrust the letter at Harry and Hermione, who leaned toward each other to read it
together:
Dear Ron,
I have only just heard (from no less a person than the Minister
of Magic himself, who has it from your new teacher, Professor
Umbridge) that you have become a Hogwarts prefect.
I was most pleasantly surprised when I heard this news and
must firstly offer my congratulations. I must admit that I have always been afraid that you would take what we might call the
“Fred and George” route, rather than following in my footsteps, so
you can imagine my feelings on hearing you have stopped flouting
authority and have decided to shoulder some real responsibility.


296



PERCY AND PADFOOT
But I want to give you more than congratulations, Ron, I
want to give you some advice, which is why I am sending this at
night rather than by the usual morning post. Hopefully you will
be able to read this away from prying eyes and avoid awkward
questions.
From something the Minister let slip when telling me you are
now a prefect, I gather that you are still seeing a lot of Harry Potter. I must tell you, Ron, that nothing could put you in danger of
losing your badge more than continued fraternization with that
boy. Yes, I am sure you are surprised to hear this — no doubt you
will say that Potter has always been Dumbledore’s favorite — but
I feel bound to tell you that Dumbledore may not be in charge at
Hogwarts much longer and the people who count have a very different — and probably more accurate — view of Potters behavior. I shall say no more here, but if you look at the Daily Prophet
tomorrow you will get a good idea of the way the wind is blowing — and see if you can spot yours truly!
Seriously, Ron, you do not want to be tarred with the same
brush as Potter, it could be very damaging to your future
prospects, and I am talking here about life after school too. As you
must be aware, given that our father escorted him to court, Potter had a disciplinary hearing this summer in front of the whole
Wizengamot and he did not come out of it looking too good. He
got off on a mere technicality if you ask me and many of the people I’ve spoken to remain convinced of his guilt.
It may be that you are afraid to sever ties with Potter — I
know that he can be unbalanced and, for all I know, violent —
but if you have any worries about this, or have spotted anything
else in Potter’s behavior that is troubling you, I urge you to speak
to Dolores Umbridge, a really delightful woman, who I know
will be only too happy to advise you.
This leads me to my other bit of advice. As I have hinted


297



CHAPTER FOURTEEN
above, Dumbledore’s regime at Hogwarts may soon be over. Your
loyalty, Ron, should be not to him, but to the school and the Ministry. I am very sorry to hear that so far Professor Umbridge is encountering very little cooperation from staff as she strives to make
those necessary changes within Hogwarts that the Ministry so ardently desires (although she should find this easier from next
week — again, see the Prophet tomorrow!). I shall say only this
— a student who shows himself willing to help Professor Umbridge now may be very well placed for Head Boyship in a couple
of years!
I am sorry that I was unable to see more of you over the summer. It pains me to criticize our parents, but I am afraid I can no
longer live under their roof while they remain mixed up with the
dangerous crowd around Dumbledore (if you are writing to
Mother at any point, you might tell her that a certain Sturgis
Podmore, who is a great friend of Dumbledore’s, has recently been
sent to Azkaban for trespass at the Ministry. Perhaps that will
open their eyes to the kind of petty criminals with whom they are
currently rubbing shoulders). I count myself very lucky to have escaped the stigma of association with such people — the Minister
really could not be more gracious to me — and I do hope, Ron,
that you will not allow family ties to blind you to the misguided
nature of our parents’ beliefs and actions either. I sincerely hope
that, in time, they will realize how mistaken they were and I
shall, of course, be ready to accept a full apology when that day
comes.
Please think over what I have said most carefully, particularly
the bit about Harry Potter, and congratulations again on becoming prefect.
Your brother,

Harry looked up at Ron.
“Well,” he said, trying to sound as though he found the whole
thing a joke, “if you want to — er — what is it?” (He checked Percy’s
letter.) “Oh yeah — ‘sever ties’ with me, I swear I won’t get violent.”
“Give it back,” said Ron, holding out his hand. “He is —” Ron said
jerkily, tearing Percy’s letter in half, “the world’s” — he tore it into
quarters — “biggest” — he tore it into eighths — “git.” He threw the
pieces into the fire.
“Come on, we’ve got to get this finished some time before dawn,”
he said briskly to Harry, pulling Professor Sinistra’s essay back toward
him.
Hermione was looking at Ron with an odd expression on her face.
“Oh, give them here,” she said abruptly.
“What?” said Ron.
“Give them to me, I’ll look through them and correct them,” she
said.
“Are you serious? Ah, Hermione, you’re a lifesaver,” said Ron,
“what can I — ?”
“What you can say is, ‘We promise we’ll never leave our homework
this late again,’ ” she said, holding out both hands for their essays, but
she looked slightly amused all the same.
“Thanks a million, Hermione,” said Harry weakly, passing over his
essay and sinking back into his armchair, rubbing his eyes.
It was now past midnight and the common room was deserted but
for the three of them and Crookshanks. The only sound was that of
Hermione’s quill scratching out sentences here and there on their
essays and the ruffle of pages as she checked various facts in the reference books strewn across the table. Harry was exhausted. He also felt
an odd, sick, empty feeling in his stomach that had nothing to do
with tiredness and everything to do with the letter now curling
blackly in the heart of the fire.
He knew that half the people inside Hogwarts thought him


299



CHAPTER FOURTEEN
strange, even mad; he knew that the Daily Prophet had been making
snide allusions to him for months, but there was something about seeing it written down like that in Percy’s writing, about knowing that
Percy was advising Ron to drop him and even to tell tales on him to
Umbridge, that made his situation real to him as nothing else had. He
had known Percy for four years, had stayed in his house during the
summers, shared a tent with him during the Quidditch World Cup,
had even been awarded full marks by him in the second task of the
Triwizard Tournament last year, yet now, Percy thought him unbalanced and possibly violent.
And with a surge of sympathy for his godfather, Harry thought that
Sirius was probably the only person he knew who could really understand how he felt at the moment, because Sirius was in the same situation; nearly everyone in the Wizarding world thought Sirius a
dangerous murderer and a great Voldemort supporter and he had had
to live with that knowledge for fourteen years. . . .
Harry blinked. He had just seen something in the fire that could
not have been there. It had flashed into sight and vanished immediately. No . . . it could not have been. . . . He had imagined it because
he had been thinking about Sirius. . . .
“Okay, write that down,” Hermione said to Ron, pushing his essay
and a sheet covered in her own writing back to Ron, “and then copy
out this conclusion that I’ve written for you.”
“Hermione, you are honestly the most wonderful person I’ve ever
met,” said Ron weakly, “and if I’m ever rude to you again —”
“— I’ll know you’re back to normal,” said Hermione. “Harry,
yours is okay except for this bit at the end, I think you must have misheard Professor Sinistra, Europa’s covered in ice, not mice — Harry?”
Harry had slid off his chair onto his knees and was now crouching
on the singed and threadbare hearthrug, gazing into the flames.
“Er — Harry?” said Ron uncertainly. “Why are you down there?”
“Because I’ve just seen Sirius’s head in the fire,” said Harry.


300



PERCY AND PADFOOT
He spoke quite calmly; after all, he had seen Sirius’s head in this
very fire the previous year and talked to it too. Nevertheless, he could
not be sure that he had really seen it this time. . . . It had vanished so
quickly. . . .
“Sirius’s head?” Hermione repeated. “You mean like when he
wanted to talk to you during the Triwizard Tournament? But he
wouldn’t do that now, it would be too — Sirius!”
She gasped, gazing at the fire; Ron dropped his quill. There in the
middle of the dancing flames sat Sirius’s head, long dark hair falling
around his grinning face.
“I was starting to think you’d go to bed before everyone else had
disappeared,” he said. “I’ve been checking every hour.”
“You’ve been popping into the fire every hour?” Harry said, half
laughing.
“Just for a few seconds to check if the coast was clear yet.”
“But what if you’d been seen?” said Hermione anxiously.
“Well, I think a girl — first year by the look of her — might’ve got
a glimpse of me earlier, but don’t worry,” Sirius said hastily, as
Hermione clapped a hand to her mouth. “I was gone the moment she
looked back at me and I’ll bet she just thought I was an oddly shaped
log or something.”
“But Sirius, this is taking an awful risk —” Hermione began.
“You sound like Molly,” said Sirius. “This was the only way I could
come up with of answering Harry’s letter without resorting to a
code — and codes are breakable.”
At the mention of Harry’s letter, Hermione and Ron had both
turned to stare at him.
“You didn’t say you’d written to Sirius!” said Hermione accusingly.
“I forgot,” said Harry, which was perfectly true; his meeting with
Cho in the Owlery had driven everything before it out of his mind.
“Don’t look at me like that, Hermione, there was no way anyone
would have got secret information out of it, was there, Sirius?”


CHAPTER FOURTEEN
“No, it was very good,” said Sirius, smiling. “Anyway, we’d better
be quick, just in case we’re disturbed — your scar.”
“What about — ?” Ron began, but Hermione said quickly, “We’ll
tell you afterward, go on, Sirius.”
“Well, I know it can’t be fun when it hurts, but we don’t think it’s
anything to really worry about. It kept aching all last year, didn’t it?”
“Yeah, and Dumbledore said it happened whenever Voldemort was
feeling a powerful emotion,” said Harry, ignoring, as usual, Ron and
Hermione’s winces. “So maybe he was just, I dunno, really angry or
something the night I had that detention.”
“Well, now he’s back it’s bound to hurt more often,” said Sirius.
“So you don’t think it had anything to do with Umbridge touching
me when I was in detention with her?” Harry asked.
“I doubt it,” said Sirius. “I know her by reputation and I’m sure
she’s no Death Eater —”
“She’s foul enough to be one,” said Harry darkly and Ron and
Hermione nodded vigorously in agreement.
“Yes, but the world isn’t split into good people and Death Eaters,”
said Sirius with a wry smile. “I know she’s a nasty piece of work,
though — you should hear Remus talk about her.”
“Does Lupin know her?” asked Harry quickly, remembering Umbridge’s comments about dangerous half-breeds during her first
lesson.
“No,” said Sirius, “but she drafted a bit of anti-werewolf legislation
two years ago that makes it almost impossible for him to get a job.”
Harry remembered how much shabbier Lupin looked these days
and his dislike of Umbridge deepened even further.
“What’s she got against werewolves?” said Hermione angrily.
“Scared of them, I expect,” said Sirius, smiling at her indignation.
“Apparently she loathes part-humans; she campaigned to have merpeople rounded up and tagged last year too. Imagine wasting your


302



PERCY AND PADFOOT
time and energy persecuting merpeople when there are little toerags
like Kreacher on the loose —”
Ron laughed but Hermione looked upset.
“Sirius!” she said reproachfully. “Honestly, if you made a bit of an effort with Kreacher I’m sure he’d respond, after all, you are the only
member of his family he’s got left, and Professor Dumbledore said —”
“So what are Umbridge’s lessons like?” Sirius interrupted. “Is she
training you all to kill half-breeds?”
“No,” said Harry, ignoring Hermione’s affronted look at being cut
off in her defense of Kreacher. “She’s not letting us use magic at all!”
“All we do is read the stupid textbook,” said Ron.
“Ah, well, that figures,” said Sirius. “Our information from inside
the Ministry is that Fudge doesn’t want you trained in combat.”
“Trained in combat?” repeated Harry incredulously. “What does he
think we’re doing here, forming some sort of wizard army?”
“That’s exactly what he thinks you’re doing,” said Sirius, “or rather,
that’s exactly what he’s afraid Dumbledore’s doing — forming his
own private army, with which he will be able to take on the Ministry
of Magic.”
There was a pause at this, then Ron said, “That’s the stupidest
thing I’ve ever heard, including all the stuff that Luna Lovegood
comes out with.”
“So we’re being prevented from learning Defense Against the Dark
Arts because Fudge is scared we’ll use spells against the Ministry?” said
Hermione, looking furious.
“Yep,” said Sirius. “Fudge thinks Dumbledore will stop at nothing
to seize power. He’s getting more paranoid about Dumbledore by the
day. It’s a matter of time before he has Dumbledore arrested on some
trumped-up charge.”
This reminded Harry of Percy’s letter.
“D’you know if there’s going to be anything about Dumbledore in


303



CHAPTER FOURTEEN
the Daily Prophet tomorrow? Only Ron’s brother Percy reckons there
will be —”
“I don’t know,” said Sirius, “I haven’t seen anyone from the Order
all weekend, they’re all busy. It’s just been Kreacher and me here. . . .”
There was a definite note of bitterness in Sirius’s voice.
“So you haven’t had any news about Hagrid, either?”
“Ah . . .” said Sirius, “well, he was supposed to be back by now, no
one’s sure what’s happened to him.” Then, seeing their stricken faces,
he added quickly, “But Dumbledore’s not worried, so don’t you three
get yourselves in a state; I’m sure Hagrid’s fine.”
“But if he was supposed to be back by now . . .” said Hermione in
a small, worried voice.
“Madame Maxime was with him, we’ve been in touch with her and
she says they got separated on the journey home — but there’s nothing to suggest he’s hurt or — well, nothing to suggest he’s not perfectly
okay.”
Unconvinced, Harry, Ron, and Hermione exchanged worried
looks.
“Listen, don’t go asking too many questions about Hagrid,” said
Sirius hastily, “it’ll just draw even more attention to the fact that he’s
not back, and I know Dumbledore doesn’t want that. Hagrid’s tough,
he’ll be okay.” And when they did not appear cheered by this, Sirius
added, “When’s your next Hogsmeade weekend anyway? I was thinking, we got away with the dog disguise at the station, didn’t we? I
thought I could —”
“NO!” said Harry and Hermione together, very loudly.
“Sirius, didn’t you see the Daily Prophet?” said Hermione anxiously.
“Oh that,” said Sirius, grinning, “they’re always guessing where I
am, they haven’t really got a clue —”
“Yeah, but we think this time they have,” said Harry. “Something
Malfoy said on the train made us think he knew it was you, and his father was on the platform, Sirius — you know, Lucius Malfoy — so


304



PERCY AND PADFOOT
don’t come up here, whatever you do, if Malfoy recognizes you
again —”
“All right, all right, I’ve got the point,” said Sirius. He looked most
displeased. “Just an idea, thought you might like to get together —”
“I would, I just don’t want you chucked back in Azkaban!” said
Harry.
There was a pause in which Sirius looked out of the fire at Harry, a
crease between his sunken eyes.
“You’re less like your father than I thought,” he said finally, a definite coolness in his voice. “The risk would’ve been what made it fun
for James.”
“Look —”
“Well, I’d better get going, I can hear Kreacher coming down the
stairs,” said Sirius, but Harry was sure he was lying. “I’ll write to tell
you a time I can make it back into the fire, then, shall I? If you can
stand to risk it?”
There was a tiny pop, and the place where Sirius’s head had been
was flickering flame once more.

THE HOGWARTS
HIGH INQUISITOR

T

hey had expected to have to comb Hermione’s Daily Prophet
carefully next morning to find the article Percy had mentioned
in his letter. However, the departing delivery owl had barely cleared
the top of the milk jug when Hermione let out a huge gasp and flattened the newspaper to reveal a large photograph of Dolores Umbridge, smiling widely and blinking slowly at them from beneath the
headline:

MINISTRY SEEKS EDUCATIONAL REFORM
DOLORES UMBRIDGE APPOINTED FIRST-EVER “HIGH INQUISITOR”
“ ‘High Inquisitor’?” said Harry darkly, his half-eaten bit of toast
slipping from his fingers. “What does that mean?”
Hermione read aloud:
“In a surprise move last night the Ministry of Magic passed new legislation giving itself an unprecedented level of control at Hogwarts School of
Witchcraft and Wizardry.
“ ‘The Minister has been growing uneasy about goings-on at Hogwarts


306



THE HOGWARTS
HIGH INQUISITOR
for some time,’ said Junior Assistant to the Minister, Percy Weasley. ‘He is
now responding to concerns voiced by anxious parents, who feel the school
may be moving in a direction they do not approve.’
“This is not the first time in recent weeks Fudge has used new laws to
effect improvements at the Wizarding school. As recently as August 30th
Educational Decree Twenty-two was passed, to ensure that, in the event of
the current headmaster being unable to provide a candidate for a teaching
post, the Ministry should select an appropriate person.
“ ‘That’s how Dolores Umbridge came to be appointed to the teaching
staff at Hogwarts,’ said Weasley last night. ‘Dumbledore couldn’t find anyone, so the Minister put in Umbridge and of course, she’s been an immediate success —’ ”
“She’s been a WHAT?” said Harry loudly.
“Wait, there’s more,” said Hermione grimly.
“ ‘— an immediate success, totally revolutionizing the teaching of
Defense Against the Dark Arts and providing the Minister with on-theground feedback about what’s really happening at Hogwarts.’
“It is this last function that the Ministry has now formalized with the
passing of Educational Decree Twenty-three, which creates the new position of ‘Hogwarts High Inquisitor.’
“ ‘This is an exciting new phase in the Minister’s plan to get to grips
with what some are calling the “falling standards” at Hogwarts,’ said
Weasley. ‘The Inquisitor will have powers to inspect her fellow educators
and make sure that they are coming up to scratch. Professor Umbridge has
been offered this position in addition to her own teaching post, and we are
delighted to say that she has accepted.’
“The Ministry’s new moves have received enthusiastic support from
parents of students at Hogwarts.
“ ‘I feel much easier in my mind now that I know that Dumbledore is
being subjected to fair and objective evaluation,’ said Mr. Lucius Malfoy,
41, speaking from his Wiltshire mansion last night. ‘Many of us with our
children’s best interests at heart have been concerned about some of


307



CHAPTER FIFTEEN
Dumbledore’s eccentric decisions in the last few years and will be glad to
know that the Ministry is keeping an eye on the situation.’
“Among those ‘eccentric decisions’ are undoubtedly the controversial
staff appointments previously described in this newspaper, which have included the hiring of werewolf Remus Lupin, half giant Rubeus Hagrid,
and delusional ex-Auror ‘Mad-Eye’ Moody.
“Rumors abound, of course, that Albus Dumbledore, once Supreme
Mugwump of the International Confederation of Wizards and Chief
Warlock of the Wizengamot, is no longer up to the task of managing the
prestigious school of Hogwarts.
“ ‘I think the appointment of the Inquisitor is a first step toward ensuring that Hogwarts has a headmaster in whom we can all repose confidence,’
said a Ministry insider last night.
“Wizengamot elders Griselda Marchbanks and Tiberius Ogden have
resigned in protest at the introduction of the post of Inquisitor to Hogwarts.
“ ‘Hogwarts is a school, not an outpost of Cornelius Fudge’s office,’ said
Madam Marchbanks. ‘This is a further disgusting attempt to discredit Albus Dumbledore.’ (For a full account of Madam Marchbanks’ alleged
links to subversive goblin groups, turn to page 17).”
Hermione finished reading and looked across the table at the other
two.
“So now we know how we ended up with Umbridge! Fudge passed
this ‘Educational Decree’ and forced her on us! And now he’s given
her the power to inspect other teachers!” Hermione was breathing fast
and her eyes were very bright. “I can’t believe this. It’s outrageous. . . .”
“I know it is,” said Harry. He looked down at his right hand,
clenched upon the tabletop, and saw the faint white outline of the
words Umbridge had forced him to cut into his skin.
But a grin was unfurling on Ron’s face.
“What?” said Harry and Hermione together, staring at him.
“Oh, I can’t wait to see McGonagall inspected,” said Ron happily.
“Umbridge won’t know what’s hit her.”

“Well, come on,” said Hermione, jumping up, “we’d better get going, if she’s inspecting Binns’s class we don’t want to be late. . . .”
But Professor Umbridge was not inspecting their History of Magic
lesson, which was just as dull as the previous Monday, nor was she in
Snape’s dungeon when they arrived for double Potions, where Harry’s
moonstone essay was handed back to him with a large, spiky black D
scrawled in an upper corner.
“I have awarded you the grades you would have received if you presented this work in your O.W.L,” said Snape with a smirk, as he swept
among them, passing back their homework. “This should give you a
realistic idea of what to expect in your examination.”
Snape reached the front of the class and turned to face them.
“The general standard of this homework was abysmal. Most of you
would have failed had this been your examination. I expect to see a
great deal more effort for this week’s essay on the various varieties of
venom antidotes, or I shall have to start handing out detentions to
those dunces who get D’s.”
He smirked as Malfoy sniggered and said in a carrying whisper,
“Some people got D’s? Ha!”
Harry realized that Hermione was looking sideways to see what
grade he had received; he slid his moonstone essay back into his bag as
quickly as possible, feeling that he would rather keep that information
private.
Determined not to give Snape an excuse to fail him this lesson,
Harry read and reread every line of the instructions on the blackboard
at least three times before acting on them. His Strengthening Solution
was not precisely the clear turquoise shade of Hermione’s but it was at
least blue rather than pink, like Neville’s, and he delivered a flask of it
to Snape’s desk at the end of the lesson with a feeling of mingled defiance and relief.
“Well, that wasn’t as bad as last week, was it?” said Hermione, as
they climbed the steps out of the dungeon and made their way across


the entrance hall toward lunch. “And the homework didn’t go too
badly either, did it?”
When neither Ron nor Harry answered, she pressed on, “I mean,
all right, I didn’t expect the top grade, not if he’s marking to O.W.L.
standard, but a pass is quite encouraging at this stage, wouldn’t you
say?”
Harry made a noncommittal noise in his throat.
“Of course, a lot can happen between now and the exam, we’ve got
plenty of time to improve, but the grades we’re getting now are a sort
of baseline, aren’t they? Something we can build on . . .”
They sat down together at the Gryffindor table.
“Obviously, I’d have been thrilled if I’d gotten an O —”
“Hermione,” said Ron sharply, “if you want to know what grades
we got, ask.”
“I don’t — I didn’t mean — well, if you want to tell me —”
“I got a P,” said Ron, ladling soup into his bowl. “Happy?”
“Well, that’s nothing to be ashamed of,” said Fred, who had just arrived at the table with George and Lee Jordan and was sitting down on
Harry’s right. “Nothing wrong with a good healthy P.”
“But,” said Hermione, “doesn’t P stand for . . .”
“ ‘Poor,’ yeah,” said Lee Jordan. “Still, better than D, isn’t it?
‘Dreadful’?”
Harry felt his face grow warm and faked a small coughing fit over
his roll. When he emerged from this he was sorry to find that
Hermione was still in full flow about O.W.L. grades.
“So top grade’s O for ‘Outstanding,’ ” she was saying, “and then
there’s A —”
“No, E,” George corrected her, “E for ‘Exceeds Expectations.’ And
I’ve always thought Fred and I should’ve got E in everything, because
we exceeded expectations just by turning up for the exams.”
They all laughed except Hermione, who plowed on, “So after E, it’s
A for ‘Acceptable,’ and that’s the last pass grade, isn’t it?”

“Yep,” said Fred, dunking an entire roll in his soup, transferring it
to his mouth, and swallowing it whole.
“Then you get P for ‘Poor’ ” — Ron raised both his arms in mock
celebration — “and D for ‘Dreadful.’ ”
“And then T,” George reminded him.
“T?” asked Hermione, looking appalled. “Even lower than a D?
What on earth does that stand for?”
“ ‘Troll,’ ” said George promptly.
Harry laughed again, though he was not sure whether or not
George was joking. He imagined trying to conceal from Hermione
that he had received T’s in all his O.W.L.s and immediately resolved
to work harder from now on.
“You lot had an inspected lesson yet?” Fred asked them.
“No,” said Hermione at once, “have you?”
“Just now, before lunch,” said George. “Charms.”
“What was it like?” Harry and Hermione asked together.
Fred shrugged.
“Not that bad. Umbridge just lurked in the corner making notes on
a clipboard. You know what Flitwick’s like, he treated her like a guest,
didn’t seem to bother him at all. She didn’t say much. Asked Alicia a
couple of questions about what the classes are normally like, Alicia
told her they were really good, that was it.”
“I can’t see old Flitwick getting marked down,” said George, “he
usually gets everyone through their exams all right.”
“Who’ve you got this afternoon?” Fred asked Harry.
“Trelawney —”
“A T if ever I saw one —”
“— and Umbridge herself.”
“Well, be a good boy and keep your temper with Umbridge today,”
said George. “Angelina’ll do her nut if you miss any more Quidditch
practices.”
But Harry did not have to wait for Defense Against the Dark Arts

to meet Professor Umbridge. He was pulling out his dream diary in a
seat at the very back of the shadowy Divination room when Ron elbowed him in the ribs and, looking round, he saw Professor Umbridge
emerging through the trapdoor in the floor. The class, which had been
talking cheerily, fell silent at once. The abrupt fall in the noise level
made Professor Trelawney, who had been wafting about handing out
Dream Oracles, look round.
“Good afternoon, Professor Trelawney,” said Professor Umbridge
with her wide smile. “You received my note, I trust? Giving the time
and date of your inspection?”
Professor Trelawney nodded curtly and, looking very disgruntled,
turned her back on Professor Umbridge and continued to give out
books. Still smiling, Professor Umbridge grasped the back of the nearest armchair and pulled it to the front of the class so that it was a few
inches behind Professor Trelawney’s seat. She then sat down, took her
clipboard from her flowery bag, and looked up expectantly, waiting
for the class to begin.
Professor Trelawney pulled her shawls tight about her with slightly
trembling hands and surveyed the class through her hugely magnifying lenses. “We shall be continuing our study of prophetic dreams today,” she said in a brave attempt at her usual mystic tones, though her
voice shook slightly. “Divide into pairs, please, and interpret each
other’s latest nighttime visions with the aid of the Oracle.”
She made as though to sweep back to her seat, saw Professor Umbridge sitting right beside it, and immediately veered left toward Parvati and Lavender, who were already deep in discussion about Parvati’s
most recent dream.
Harry opened his copy of The Dream Oracle, watching Umbridge
covertly. She was making notes on her clipboard now. After a few minutes she got to her feet and began to pace the room in Trelawney’s
wake, listening to her conversations with students and posing questions here and there. Harry bent his head hurriedly over his book.

“Think of a dream, quick,” he told Ron, “in case the old toad
comes our way.”
“I did it last time,” Ron protested, “it’s your turn, you tell me one.”
“Oh, I dunno . . .” said Harry desperately, who could not remember dreaming anything at all over the last few days. “Let’s say I dreamed
I was . . . drowning Snape in my cauldron. Yeah, that’ll do. . . .”
Ron chortled as he opened his Dream Oracle.
“Okay, we’ve got to add your age to the date you had the dream, the
number of letters in the subject . . . would that be ‘drowning’ or ‘cauldron’ or ‘Snape’?”
“It doesn’t matter, pick any of them,” said Harry, chancing a glance
behind him. Professor Umbridge was now standing at Professor Trelawney’s shoulder making notes while the Divination teacher questioned Neville about his dream diary.
“What night did you dream this again?” Ron said, immersed in
calculations.
“I dunno, last night, whenever you like,” Harry told him, trying to
listen to what Umbridge was saying to Professor Trelawney. They were
only a table away from him and Ron now. Professor Umbridge was
making another note on her clipboard and Professor Trelawney was
looking extremely put out.
“Now,” said Umbridge, looking up at Trelawney, “you’ve been in
this post how long, exactly?”
Professor Trelawney scowled at her, arms crossed and shoulders
hunched as though wishing to protect herself as much as possible
from the indignity of the inspection. After a slight pause in which she
seemed to decide that the question was not so offensive that she could
reasonably ignore it, she said in a deeply resentful tone, “Nearly sixteen years.”
“Quite a period,” said Professor Umbridge, making a note on her
clipboard. “So it was Professor Dumbledore who appointed you?”
“That’s right,” said Professor Trelawney shortly.

Professor Umbridge made another note.
“And you are a great-great-granddaughter of the celebrated Seer
Cassandra Trelawney?”
“Yes,” said Professor Trelawney, holding her head a little higher.
Another note on the clipboard.
“But I think — correct me if I am mistaken — that you are the
first in your family since Cassandra to be possessed of second sight?”
“These things often skip — er — three generations,” said Professor
Trelawney.
Professor Umbridge’s toadlike smile widened.
“Of course,” she said sweetly, making yet another note. “Well, if
you could just predict something for me, then?”
She looked up inquiringly, still smiling. Professor Trelawney had
stiffened as though unable to believe her ears.
“I don’t understand you,” said Professor Trelawney, clutching convulsively at the shawl around her scrawny neck.
“I’d like you to make a prediction for me,” said Professor Umbridge
very clearly.
Harry and Ron were not the only people watching and listening
sneakily from behind their books now; most of the class were staring
transfixed at Professor Trelawney as she drew herself up to her full
height, her beads and bangles clinking.
“The Inner Eye does not See upon command!” she said in scandalized tones.
“I see,” said Professor Umbridge softly, making yet another note on
her clipboard.
“I — but — but . . . wait!” said Professor Trelawney suddenly, in
an attempt at her usual ethereal voice, though the mystical effect was
ruined somewhat by the way it was shaking with anger. “I . . . I think
I do see something . . . something that concerns you. . . . Why, I sense
something . . . something dark . . . some grave peril . . .”

Professor Trelawney pointed a shaking finger at Professor Umbridge who continued to smile blandly at her, eyebrows raised.
“I am afraid . . . I am afraid that you are in grave danger!” Professor
Trelawney finished dramatically.
There was a pause. Professor Umbridge’s eyebrows were still raised.
“Right,” she said softly, scribbling on her clipboard once more.
“Well, if that’s really the best you can do . . .”
She turned away, leaving Professor Trelawney standing rooted
to the spot, her chest heaving. Harry caught Ron’s eye and knew that
Ron was thinking exactly the same as he was: They both knew
that Professor Trelawney was an old fraud, but on the other hand,
they loathed Umbridge so much that they felt very much on Trelawney’s side — until she swooped down on them a few seconds
later, that was.
“Well?” she said, snapping her long fingers under Harry’s nose, uncharacteristically brisk. “Let me see the start you’ve made on your
dream diary, please.”
And by the time she had interpreted Harry’s dreams at the top of
her voice (all of which, even the ones that involved eating porridge,
apparently foretold a gruesome and early death), he was feeling much
less sympathetic toward her. All the while, Professor Umbridge stood
a few feet away, making notes on that clipboard, and when the bell
rang she descended the silver ladder first so that she was waiting for
them all when they reached their Defense Against the Dark Arts lesson ten minutes later.
She was humming and smiling to herself when they entered the
room. Harry and Ron told Hermione, who had been in Arithmancy,
exactly what had happened in Divination while they all took out their
copies of Defensive Magical Theory, but before Hermione could ask
any questions Professor Umbridge had called them all to order and silence fell.

He bent down and tugged the dragon steak out of Fang’s mouth.
“Oh, Hagrid, don’t, it’s not hygien —” Hermione began, but Hagrid had already slapped the meat back over his swollen eye. He took
another fortifying gulp of tea and then said, “Well, we set off righ’ after term ended —”
“Madame Maxime went with you, then?” Hermione interjected.
“Yeah, tha’s right,” said Hagrid, and a softened expression appeared
on the few inches of face that were not obscured by beard or green
steak. “Yeah, it was jus’ the pair of us. An’ I’ll tell yeh this, she’s not
afraid of roughin’ it, Olympe. Yeh know, she’s a fine, well-dressed
woman, an’ knowin’ where we was goin’ I wondered ’ow she’d feel

“You knew where you were going?” Harry asked. “You knew where
the giants were?”
“Well, Dumbledore knew, an’ he told us,” said Hagrid.
“Are they hidden?” asked Ron. “Is it a secret, where they are?”
“Not really,” said Hagrid, shaking his shaggy head. “It’s jus’ that
mos’ wizards aren’ bothered where they are, s’ long as it’s a good long
way away. But where they are’s very difficult ter get ter, fer humans
anyway, so we needed Dumbledore’s instructions. Took us abou’ a
month ter get there —”
“A month?” said Ron, as though he had never heard of a journey
lasting such a ridiculously long time. “But — why couldn’t you just
grab a Portkey or something?”
There was an odd expression in Hagrid’s unobscured eye as he
squinted at Ron; it was almost pitying.
“We’re bein’ watched, Ron,” he said gruffly.
“What d’you mean?”
“Yeh don’ understand,” said Hagrid. “The Ministry’s keepin’ an eye
on Dumbledore an’ anyone they reckon’s in league with him, an’ —”
“We know about that,” said Harry quickly, keen to hear the rest
of Hagrid’s story. “We know about the Ministry watching Dumbledore —”
“So you couldn’t use magic to get there?” asked Ron, looking thunderstruck. “You had to act like Muggles all the way?”
“Well, not exactly all the way,” said Hagrid cagily. “We jus’ had ter
be careful, ’cause Olympe an’ me, we stick out a bit —”
Ron made a stifled noise somewhere between a snort and a sniff
and hastily took a gulp of tea.
“— so we’re not hard ter follow. We was pretendin’ we was goin’ on
holiday together, so we got inter France an’ we made like we was
headin’ fer where Olympe’s school is, ’cause we knew we was bein’
tailed by someone from the Ministry. We had to go slow, ’cause I’m
not really s’posed ter use magic an’ we knew the Ministry’d be lookin’

the slip round abou’ Dee-John —”
“Ooooh, Dijon?” said Hermione excitedly. “I’ve been there on holiday, did you see — ?”
She fell silent at the look on Ron’s face.
“We chanced a bit o’ magic after that, and it wasn’ a bad journey.
Ran inter a couple o’ mad trolls on the Polish border, an’ I had a sligh’
disagreement with a vampire in a pub in Minsk, but apart from tha’,
couldn’t’a bin smoother.
“An’ then we reached the place, an’ we started trekkin’ up through
the mountains, lookin’ fer signs of ’em . . .
“We had ter lay off the magic once we got near ’em. Partly ’cause they
don’ like wizards an’ we didn’ want ter put their backs up too soon, and
partly ’cause Dumbledore had warned us You-Know-Who was bound
ter be after the giants an’ all. Said it was odds on he’d sent a messenger
off ter them already. Told us ter be very careful of drawin’ attention ter
ourselves as we got nearer in case there was Death Eaters around.”
Hagrid paused for a long draft of tea.
“Go on!” said Harry urgently.
“Found ’em,” said Hagrid baldly. “Went over a ridge one nigh’ an’
there they was, spread ou’ underneath us. Little fires burnin’ below an’
huge shadows . . . It was like watchin’ bits o’ the mountain movin’.”
“How big are they?” asked Ron in a hushed voice.
“ ’Bout twenty feet,” said Hagrid casually. “Some o’ the bigger ones
mighta bin twenty-five.”
“And how many were there?” asked Harry.
“I reckon abou’ seventy or eighty,” said Hagrid.
“Is that all?” said Hermione.
“Yep,” said Hagrid sadly, “eighty left, an’ there was loads once,
musta bin a hundred diff ’rent tribes from all over the world. But
they’ve bin dyin’ out fer ages. Wizards killed a few, o’ course, but

mostly they killed each other, an’ now they’re dyin’ out faster than
ever. They’re not made ter live bunched up together like tha’. Dumbledore says it’s our fault, it was the wizards who forced ’em to go an’
made ’em live a good long way from us an’ they had no choice but ter
stick together fer their own protection.”
“So,” said Harry, “you saw them and then what?”
“Well, we waited till morning, didn’ want ter go sneakin’ up on ’em
in the dark, fer our own safety,” said Hagrid. “ ’Bout three in the
mornin’ they fell asleep jus’ where they was sittin’. We didn’ dare sleep.
Fer one thing, we wanted ter make sure none of ’em woke up an’
came up where we were, an’ fer another, the snorin’ was unbelievable.
Caused an avalanche near mornin’.
“Anyway, once it was light we wen’ down ter see ’em.”
“Just like that?” said Ron, looking awestruck. “You just walked
right into a giant camp?”
“Well, Dumbledore’d told us how ter do it,” said Hagrid. “Give the
Gurg gifts, show some respect, yeh know.”
“Give the what gifts?” asked Harry.
“Oh, the Gurg — means the chief.”
“How could you tell which one was the Gurg?” asked Ron.
Hagrid grunted in amusement.
“No problem,” he said. “He was the biggest, the ugliest, an’ the
laziest. Sittin’ there waitin’ ter be brought food by the others. Dead
goats an’ such like. Name o’ Karkus. I’d put him at twenty-two,
twenty-three feet, an’ the weight of a couple o’ bull elephants. Skin
like rhino hide an’ all.”
“And you just walked up to him?” said Hermione breathlessly.
“Well . . . down ter him, where he was lyin’ in the valley. They was
in this dip between four pretty high mountains, see, beside a mountain lake, an’ Karkus was lyin’ by the lake roarin’ at the others ter feed
him an’ his wife. Olympe an’ I went down the mountainside —”

“But didn’t they try and kill you when they saw you?” asked Ron
incredulously.
“It was def ’nitely on some of their minds,” said Hagrid, shrugging,
“but we did what Dumbledore told us ter do, which was ter hold our
gift up high an’ keep our eyes on the Gurg an’ ignore the others. So
tha’s what we did. An’ the rest of ’em went quiet an’ watched us pass
an’ we got right up ter Karkus’s feet an’ we bowed an’ put our present
down in front o’ him.”
“What do you give a giant?” asked Ron eagerly. “Food?”
“Nah, he can get food all righ’ fer himself,” said Hagrid. “We took
him magic. Giants like magic, jus’ don’t like us usin’ it against ’em.
Anyway, that firs’ day we gave him a branch o’ Gubraithian fire.”
Hermione said “wow” softly, but Harry and Ron both frowned in
puzzlement.
“A branch of — ?”
“Everlasting fire,” said Hermione irritably, “you ought to know that
by now, Professor Flitwick’s mentioned it at least twice in class!”
“Well anyway,” said Hagrid quickly, intervening before Ron could
answer back, “Dumbledore’d bewitched this branch to burn evermore, which isn’ somethin’ any wizard could do, an’ so I lies it down
in the snow by Karkus’s feet and says, ‘A gift to the Gurg of the giants
from Albus Dumbledore, who sends his respectful greetings.’ ”
“And what did Karkus say?” asked Harry eagerly.
“Nothin’,” said Hagrid. “Didn’ speak English.”
“You’re kidding!”
“Didn’ matter,” said Hagrid imperturbably, “Dumbledore had
warned us tha’ migh’ happen. Karkus knew enough to yell fer a couple o’ giants who knew our lingo an’ they translated fer us.”
“And did he like the present?” asked Ron.
“Oh yeah, it went down a storm once they understood what it
was,” said Hagrid, turning his dragon steak over to press the cooler

side to his swollen eye. “Very pleased. So then I said, ‘Albus Dumbledore asks the Gurg to speak with his messenger when he returns tomorrow with another gift.’ ”
“Why couldn’t you speak to them that day?” asked Hermione.
“Dumbledore wanted us ter take it very slow,” said Hagrid. “Let
’em see we kept our promises. We’ll come back tomorrow with another
present, an’ then we do come back with another present — gives a
good impression, see? An’ gives them time ter test out the firs’ present
an’ find out it’s a good one, an’ get ’em eager fer more. In any case, giants like Karkus — overload ’em with information an’ they’ll kill yeh
jus’ to simplify things. So we bowed outta the way an’ went off an’
found ourselves a nice little cave ter spend that night in, an’ the followin’ mornin’ we went back an’ this time we found Karkus sittin’ up
waitin’ fer us lookin’ all eager.”
“And you talked to him?”
“Oh yeah. Firs’ we presented him with a nice battle helmet —
goblin-made an’ indestructible, yeh know — an’ then we sat down an’
we talked.”
“What did he say?”
“Not much,” said Hagrid. “Listened mostly. But there were good
signs. He’d heard o’ Dumbledore, heard he’d argued against the killin’
of the last giants in Britain. Karkus seemed ter be quite int’rested in
what Dumbledore had ter say. An’ a few o’ the others, ’specially the
ones who had some English, they gathered round an’ listened too. We
were hopeful when we left that day. Promised ter come back next day
with another present.
“But that night it all wen’ wrong.”
“What d’you mean?” said Ron quickly.
“Well, like I say, they’re not meant ter live together, giants,” said
Hagrid sadly. “Not in big groups like that. They can’ help themselves,
they half kill each other every few weeks. The men fight each other an’

CHAPTER TWENTY
the women fight each other, the remnants of the old tribes fight each
other, an’ that’s even without squabbles over food an’ the best fires an’
sleepin’ spots. Yeh’d think, seein’ as how their whole race is abou’ finished, they’d lay off each other, but . . .”
Hagrid sighed deeply
“That night a fight broke out, we saw it from the mouth of our
cave, lookin’ down on the valley. Went on fer hours, yeh wouldn’ believe the noise. An’ when the sun came up the snow was scarlet an’ his
head was lyin’ at the bottom o’ the lake.”
“Whose head?” gasped Hermione.
“Karkus’s,” said Hagrid heavily. “There was a new Gurg, Golgomath.” He sighed deeply. “Well, we hadn’ bargained on a new Gurg
two days after we’d made friendly contact with the firs’ one, an’ we had
a funny feelin’ Golgomath wouldn’ be so keen ter listen to us, but we
had ter try.”
“You went to speak to him?” asked Ron incredulously. “After you’d
watched him rip off another giant’s head?”
“ ’Course we did,” said Hagrid, “we hadn’ gone all that way ter give
up after two days! We wen’ down with the next present we’d meant ter
give ter Karkus.
“I knew it was no go before I’d opened me mouth. He was sitting
there wearin’ Karkus’s helmet, leerin’ at us as we got nearer. He’s massive, one o’ the biggest ones there. Black hair an’ matchin’ teeth an’ a
necklace o’ bones. Human-lookin’ bones, some of ’em. Well, I gave it
a go — held out a great roll o’ dragon skin — an’ said A gift fer the
Gurg of the giants —’ Nex’ thing I knew, I was hangin’ upside down
in the air by me feet, two of his mates had grabbed me.”
Hermione clapped her hands to her mouth.
“How did you get out of that?” asked Harry.
“Wouldn’ta done if Olympe hadn’ bin there,” said Hagrid. “She
pulled out her wand an’ did some o’ the fastes’ spellwork I’ve ever seen.

way we was going ter be able ter march inter camp again.”
“Blimey, Hagrid,” said Ron quietly.
“So how come it’s taken you so long to get home if you were only
there for three days?” asked Hermione.
“We didn’ leave after three days!” said Hagrid, looking outraged.
“Dumbledore was relyin’ on us!”
“But you’ve just said there was no way you could go back!”
“Not by daylight, we couldn’, no. We just had ter rethink a bit.
Spent a couple o’ days lyin’ low up in the cave an’ watchin’. An’ wha’
we saw wasn’ good.”
“Did he rip off more heads?” asked Hermione, sounding squeamish.
“No,” said Hagrid. “I wish he had.”
“What d’you mean?”
“I mean we soon found out he didn’ object ter all wizards — just us.”
“Death Eaters?” said Harry quickly.
“Yep,” said Hagrid darkly. “Couple of ’em were visitin’ him ev’ry
day, bringin’ gifts ter the Gurg, an’ he wasn’ dangling them upside
down.”
“How d’you know they were Death Eaters?” said Ron.
“Because I recognized one of ’em,” Hagrid growled. “Macnair, remember him? Bloke they sent ter kill Buckbeak? Maniac, he is. Likes
killin’ as much as Golgomath, no wonder they were gettin’ on so well.”
“So Macnair’s persuaded the giants to join You-Know-Who?” said
Hermione desperately.
“Hold yer hippogriffs, I haven’ finished me story yet!” said Hagrid
indignantly, who, considering he had not wanted to tell them anything in the first place, now seemed to be rather enjoying himself. “Me

an’ Olympe talked it over an’ we agreed, jus’ ’cause the Gurg looked
like favorin’ You-Know-Who didn’ mean all of ’em would. We had ter
try an’ persuade some o’ the others, the ones who hadn’ wanted Golgomath as Gurg.”
“How could you tell which ones they were?” asked Ron.
“Well, they were the ones bein’ beaten to a pulp, weren’ they?” said
Hagrid patiently. “The ones with any sense were keepin’ outta Golgomath’s way, hidin’ out in caves roun’ the gully jus’ like we were. So we
decided we’d go pokin’ round the caves by night an’ see if we couldn’
persuade a few o’ them.”
“You went poking around dark caves looking for giants?” said Ron
with awed respect in his voice.
“Well, it wasn’ the giants who worried us most,” said Hagrid. “We
were more concerned abou’ the Death Eaters. Dumbledore had told us
before we wen’ not ter tangle with ’em if we could avoid it, an’ the trouble was they knew we was around — ’spect Golgomath told him abou’
us. At night when the giants were sleepin’ an’ we wanted ter be creepin’
inter the caves, Macnair an’ the other one were sneakin’ round the
mountains lookin’ fer us. I was hard put to stop Olympe jumpin’ out
at them,” said Hagrid, the corners of his mouth lifting his wild beard.
“She was rarin’ ter attack ’em. . . . she’s somethin’ when she’s roused,
Olympe. . . . Fiery, yeh know . . . ’spect it’s the French in her . . .”
Hagrid gazed misty-eyed into the fire. Harry allowed him thirty
seconds’ reminiscence before clearing his throat loudly.
“So what happened? Did you ever get near any of the other giants?”
“What? Oh . . . oh yeah, we did. Yeah, on the third night after
Karkus was killed, we crept outta the cave we’d bin hidin’ in and
headed back down inter the gully, keepin’ our eyes skinned fer the
Death Eaters. Got inside a few o’ the caves, no go — then, in abou’

“Didn’t they attack you when they saw you?” asked Hermione.
“Probably woulda done if they’d bin in any condition,” said Hagrid, “but they was badly hurt, all three o’ them. Golgomath’s lot had
beaten ’em unconscious; they’d woken up an’ crawled inter the nearest shelter they could find. Anyway, one o’ them had a bit of English

go down too badly. So we kep’ goin’ back, visitin’ the wounded. . . . I
reckon we had abou’ six or seven o’ them convinced at one poin’.”
“Six or seven?” said Ron eagerly. “Well that’s not bad — are they
going to come over here and start fighting You-Know-Who with us?”
But Hermione said, “What do you mean ‘at one point,’ Hagrid?”
Hagrid looked at her sadly.
“Golgomath’s lot raided the caves. The ones tha’ survived didn’
wan’ no more ter to do with us after that.”
“So . . . so there aren’t any giants coming?” said Ron, looking
disappointed.
“Nope,” said Hagrid, heaving a deep sigh as he turned over his
steak again and applied the cooler side to his face, “but we did wha’ we
meant ter do, we gave ’em Dumbledore’s message an’ some o’ them
heard it an’ I ’spect some o’ them’ll remember it. Jus’ maybe, them that
don’ want ter stay around Golgomath’ll move outta the mountains,
an’ there’s gotta be a chance they’ll remember Dumbledore’s friendly
to ’em. . . . Could be they’ll come . . .”
Snow was filling up the window now. Harry became aware that the
knees of his robes were soaked through; Fang was drooling with his
head in Harry’s lap.
“Hagrid?” said Hermione quietly after a while.
“Mmm?”
“Did you . . . was there any sign of . . . did you hear anything about
your . . . your . . . mother while you were there?”

Hagrid’s unobscured eye rested upon her, and Hermione looked
rather scared.
“I’m sorry . . . I . . . forget it —”
“Dead,” Hagrid grunted. “Died years ago. They told me.”
“Oh . . . I’m . . . I’m really sorry,” said Hermione in a very small
voice.
Hagrid shrugged his massive shoulders. “No need,” he said shortly.
“Can’ remember her much. Wasn’ a great mother.”
They were silent again. Hermione glanced nervously at Harry and
Ron, plainly wanting them to speak.
“But you still haven’t explained how you got in this state, Hagrid,”
Ron said, gesturing toward Hagrid’s bloodstained face.
“Or why you’re back so late,” said Harry. “Sirius says Madame
Maxime got back ages ago —”
“Who attacked you?” said Ron.
“I haven’ bin attacked!” said Hagrid emphatically. “I —”
But the rest of his words were drowned in a sudden outbreak of
rapping on the door. Hermione gasped; her mug slipped through her
fingers and smashed on the floor; Fang yelped. All four of them stared
at the window beside the doorway. The shadow of somebody small
and squat rippled across the thin curtain.
“It’s her!” Ron whispered.
“Get under here!” Harry said quickly; seizing the Invisibility Cloak
he whirled it over himself and Hermione while Ron tore around the
table and dived beneath the cloak as well. Huddled together they
backed away into a corner. Fang was barking madly at the door. Hagrid looked thoroughly confused.
“Hagrid, hide our mugs!”
Hagrid seized Harry’s and Ron’s mugs and shoved them under
the cushion in Fang’s basket. Fang was now leaping up at the door;
Hagrid pushed him out of the way with his foot and pulled it open.
Professor Umbridge was standing in the doorway wearing her




HAGRID’S TALE
green tweed cloak and a matching hat with earflaps. Lips pursed, she
leaned back so as to see Hagrid’s face; she barely reached his navel.
“So,” she said slowly and loudly, as though speaking to somebody
deaf. “You’re Hagrid, are you?”
Without waiting for an answer she strolled into the room, her
bulging eyes rolling in every direction.
“Get away,” she snapped, waving her handbag at Fang, who had
bounded up to her and was attempting to lick her face.
“Er — I don’ want ter be rude,” said Hagrid, staring at her, “but
who the ruddy hell are you?”
“My name is Dolores Umbridge.”
Her eyes were sweeping the cabin. Twice they stared directly into
the corner where Harry stood, sandwiched between Ron and Hermione.
“Dolores Umbridge?” Hagrid said, sounding thoroughly confused.
“I thought you were one o’ them Ministry — don’ you work with
Fudge?”
“I was Senior Undersecretary to the Minister, yes,” said Umbridge,
now pacing around the cabin, taking in every tiny detail within, from
the haversack against the wall to the abandoned traveling cloak. “I am
now the Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher —”
“Tha’s brave of yeh,” said Hagrid, “there’s not many’d take tha’ job
anymore —”
“— and Hogwarts High Inquisitor,” said Umbridge, giving no sign
that she had heard him.
“Wha’s that?” said Hagrid, frowning.
“Precisely what I was going to ask,” said Umbridge, pointing at the
broken shards of china on the floor that had been Hermione’s mug.
“Oh,” said Hagrid, with a most unhelpful glance toward the corner
where Harry, Ron, and Hermione stood hidden, “oh, tha’ was . . . was
Fang. He broke a mug. So I had ter use this one instead.”
Hagrid pointed to the mug from which he had been drinking, one

hand still clamped over the dragon steak pressed to his eye. Umbridge
stood facing him now, taking in every detail of his appearance instead
of the cabin’s.
“I heard voices,” she said quietly.
“I was talkin’ ter Fang,” said Hagrid stoutly.
“And was he talking back to you?”
“Well . . . in a manner o’ speakin’,” said Hagrid, looking uncomfortable. “I sometimes say Fang’s near enough human —”
“There are three sets of footprints in the snow leading from the castle doors to your cabin,” said Umbridge sleekly.
Hermione gasped; Harry clapped a hand over her mouth. Luckily,
Fang was sniffing loudly around the hem of Professor Umbridge’s
robes, and she did not appear to have heard.
“Well, I on’y jus’ got back,” said Hagrid, waving an enormous hand
at the haversack. “Maybe someone came ter call earlier an’ I missed
em.
“There are no footsteps leading away from your cabin door.”
“Well I . . . I don’ know why that’d be. . . .” said Hagrid, tugging
nervously at his beard and again glancing toward the corner where
Harry, Ron, and Hermione stood, as though asking for help.
“Erm . . .”
Umbridge wheeled around and strode the length of the cabin,
looking around carefully. She bent and peered under the bed. She
opened Hagrid’s cupboards. She passed within two inches of where
Harry, Ron, and Hermione stood pressed against the wall; Harry actually pulled in his stomach as she walked by. After looking carefully
inside the enormous cauldron Hagrid used for cooking she wheeled
around again and said, “What has happened to you? How did you
sustain those injuries?”
Hagrid hastily removed the dragon steak from his face, which in
Harry’s opinion was a mistake, because the black-and-purple bruising

HAGRID’S TALE
all around his eye was now clearly visible, not to mention the large
amount of fresh and congealed blood on his face. “Oh, I . . . had a bit
of an accident,” he said lamely.
“What sort of accident?”
“I-I tripped.”
“You tripped,” she repeated coolly.
“Yeah, tha’s right. Over . . . over a friends broomstick. I don’ fly,
meself. Well, look at the size o’ me, I don’ reckon there’s a broomstick
that’d hold me. Friend o’ mine breeds Abraxan horses, I dunno if
you’ve ever seen ’em, big beasts, winged, yeh know, I’ve had a bit of a
ride on one o’ them an’ it was —”
“Where have you been?” asked Umbridge, cutting coolly through
Hagrid’s babbling.
“Where’ve I . . . ?”
“Been, yes,” she said. “Term started more than two months ago.
Another teacher has had to cover your classes. None of your colleagues
has been able to give me any information as to your whereabouts. You
left no address. Where have you been?”
There was a pause in which Hagrid stared at her with his newly uncovered eye. Harry could almost hear his brain working furiously.
“I — I’ve been away for me health,” he said.
“For your health,” said Umbridge. Her eyes traveled over Hagrid’s
discolored and swollen face; dragon blood dripped gently onto his
waistcoat in the silence. “I see.”
“Yeah,” said Hagrid, “bit o’ — o’ fresh air, yeh know —”
“Yes, as gamekeeper fresh air must be so difficult to come by,” said
Umbridge sweetly. The small patch of Hagrid’s face that was not black
or purple flushed.
“Well — change o’ scene, yeh know —”
“Mountain scenery?” said Umbridge swiftly.
She knows, Harry thought desperately.


CHAPTER TWENTY
“Mountains?” Hagrid repeated, clearly thinking fast. “Nope, South
of France fer me. Bit o’ sun an’ . . . an’ sea.”
“Really?” said Umbridge. “You don’t have much of a tan.”
“Yeah . . . well . . . sensitive skin,” said Hagrid, attempting an ingratiating smile. Harry noticed that two of his teeth had been knocked
out. Umbridge looked at him coldly; his smile faltered. Then she
hoisted her handbag a little higher into the crook of her arm and said,
“I shall, of course, be informing the Minister of your late return.”
“Righ’,” said Hagrid, nodding.
“You ought to know too that as High Inquisitor it is my unfortunate but necessary duty to inspect my fellow teachers. So I daresay we
shall meet again soon enough.”
She turned sharply and marched back to the door.
“You’re inspectin’ us?” Hagrid echoed blankly, looking after her.
“Oh yes,” said Umbridge softly, looking back at him with her hand
on the door handle. “The Ministry is determined to weed out unsatisfactory teachers, Hagrid. Good night.”
She left, closing the door behind her with a snap. Harry made to
pull off the Invisibility Cloak but Hermione seized his wrist.
“Not yet,” she breathed in his ear. “She might not be gone yet.”
Hagrid seemed to be thinking the same way; he stumped across the
room and pulled back the curtain an inch or so.
“She’s goin’ back ter the castle,” he said in a low voice. “Blimey . . .
inspectin’ people, is she?”
“Yeah,” said Harry, pulling the cloak off. “Trelawney’s on probation
already. . . .”
“Um . . . what sort of thing are you planning to do with us in class,
Hagrid?” asked Hermione.
“Oh, don’ you worry abou’ that, I’ve got a great load o’ lessons
planned,” said Hagrid enthusiastically, scooping up his dragon steak
from the table and slapping it over his eye again. “I’ve bin keepin’ a

couple o’ creatures saved fer yer O.W.L. year, you wait, they’re somethin’ really special.”
“Erm . . . special in what way?” asked Hermione tentatively.
“I’m not sayin’,” said Hagrid happily. “I don’ want ter spoil the
surprise.”
“Look, Hagrid,” said Hermione urgently, dropping all pretense,
“Professor Umbridge won’t be at all happy if you bring anything to
class that’s too dangerous —”
“Dangerous?” said Hagrid, looking genially bemused. “Don’ be
silly, I wouldn’ give yeh anythin’ dangerous! I mean, all righ’, they can
look after themselves —”
“Hagrid, you’ve got to pass Umbridge’s inspection, and to do that
it would really be better if she saw you teaching us how to look after
porlocks, how to tell the difference between knarls and hedgehogs,
stuff like that!” said Hermione earnestly.
“But tha’s not very interestin’, Hermione,” said Hagrid. “The stuff
I’ve got’s much more impressive, I’ve bin bringin’ ’em on fer years, I
reckon I’ve got the on’y domestic herd in Britain —”
“Hagrid . . . please . . .” said Hermione, a note of real desperation
in her voice. “Umbridge is looking for any excuse to get rid of teachers she thinks are too close to Dumbledore. Please, Hagrid, teach us
something dull that’s bound to come up in our O.W.L. . . .”
But Hagrid merely yawned widely and cast a one-eyed look of
longing toward the vast bed in the corner.
“Lis’en, it’s bin a long day an’ it’s late,” he said, patting Hermione
gently on the shoulder, so that her knees gave way and hit the floor
with a thud. “Oh — sorry —” He pulled her back up by the neck of
her robes. “Look, don’ you go worryin’ abou’ me, I promise yeh I’ve
got really good stuff planned fer yer lessons now I’m back. . . . Now
you lot had better get back up to the castle, an’ don’ forget ter wipe

“I dunno if you got through to him,” said Ron a short while later
when, having checked that the coast was clear, they walked back up to
the castle through the thickening snow, leaving no trace behind them
due to the Obliteration Charm Hermione was performing as they
went.
“Then I’ll go back again tomorrow,” said Hermione determinedly.
“I’ll plan his lessons for him if I have to. I don’t care if she throws out
Trelawney but she’s not taking Hagrid!”

H

ermione plowed her way back to Hagrid’s cabin through two
feet of snow on Sunday morning. Harry and Ron wanted to
go with her, but their mountain of homework had reached an alarming height again, so they grudgingly remained in the common room,
trying to ignore the gleeful shouts drifting up from the grounds outside, where students were enjoying themselves skating on the frozen
lake, tobogganing, and worst of all, bewitching snowballs to zoom up
to Gryffindor Tower and rap hard on the windows.
“Oy!” bellowed Ron, finally losing patience and sticking his head
out of the window, “I am a prefect and if one more snowball hits this
window — OUCH!”
He withdrew his head sharply, his face covered in snow.
“It’s Fred and George,” he said bitterly, slamming the window behind him. “Gits . . .”
Hermione returned from Hagrid’s just before lunch, shivering
slightly, her robes damp to the knees.
“So?” said Ron, looking up when she entered. “Got all his lessons
planned for him?”


CHAPTER TWENTY-ONE
“Well, I tried,” she said dully, sinking into a chair beside Harry. She
pulled out her wand and gave it a complicated little wave so that hot
air streamed out of the tip; she then pointed this at her robes, which
began to steam as they dried out. “He wasn’t even there when I arrived, I was knocking for at least half an hour. And then he came
stumping out of the forest —”
Harry groaned. The Forbidden Forest was teeming with the kind of
creatures most likely to get Hagrid the sack. “What’s he keeping in
there? Did he say?” asked Harry.
“No,” said Hermione miserably. “He says he wants them to be a
surprise. I tried to explain about Umbridge, but he just doesn’t get it.
He kept saying nobody in their right mind would rather study knarls
than chimaeras — oh I don’t think he’s got a chimaera,” she added at
the appalled look on Harry and Ron’s faces, “but that’s not for lack of
trying from what he said about how hard it is to get eggs. . . . I don’t
know how many times I told him he’d be better off following
Grubbly-Plank’s plan, I honestly don’t think he listened to half of
what I said. He’s in a bit of a funny mood, you know. He still won’t
say how he got all those injuries. . . .”
Hagrid’s reappearance at the staff table at breakfast next day was
not greeted by enthusiasm from all students. Some, like Fred, George,
and Lee, roared with delight and sprinted up the aisle between the
Gryffindor and Hufflepuff tables to wring Hagrid’s enormous hand;
others, like Parvati and Lavender, exchanged gloomy looks and shook
their heads. Harry knew that many of them preferred Professor
Grubbly-Plank’s lessons, and the worst of it was that a very small, unbiased part of him knew that they had good reason: Grubbly-Plank’s
idea of an interesting class was not one where there was a risk that
somebody might have their head ripped off.
It was with a certain amount of apprehension that Harry, Ron, and
Hermione headed down to Hagrid’s on Tuesday, heavily muffled
against the cold. Harry was worried, not only about what Hagrid


442



THE EYE OF THE SNAKE
might have decided to teach them, but also about how the rest of the
class, particularly Malfoy and his cronies, would behave if Umbridge
was watching them.
However, the High Inquisitor was nowhere to be seen as they struggled through the snow toward Hagrid, who stood waiting for them on
the edge of the forest. He did not present a reassuring sight; the
bruises that had been purple on Saturday night were now tinged with
green and yellow and some of his cuts still seemed to be bleeding.
Harry could not understand this: Had Hagrid perhaps been attacked
by some creature whose venom prevented the wounds it inflicted from
healing? As though to complete the ominous picture, Hagrid was
carrying what looked like half a dead cow over his shoulder.
“We’re workin’ in here today!” Hagrid called happily to the approaching students, jerking his head back at the dark trees behind
him. “Bit more sheltered! Anyway, they prefer the dark. . . .”
“What prefers the dark?” Harry heard Malfoy say sharply to
Crabbe and Goyle, a trace of panic in his voice. “What did he say
prefers the dark — did you hear?”
Harry remembered the only occasion on which Malfoy had entered
the forest before now; he had not been very brave then either. He
smiled to himself; after the Quidditch match anything that caused
Malfoy discomfort was all right with him.
“Ready?” said Hagrid happily, looking around at the class. “Right,
well, I’ve bin savin’ a trip inter the forest fer yer fifth year. Thought
we’d go an’ see these creatures in their natural habitat. Now, what
we’re studyin’ today is pretty rare, I reckon I’m probably the on’y person in Britain who’s managed ter train ’em —”
“And you’re sure they’re trained, are you?” said Malfoy, the panic in
his voice even more pronounced now. “Only it wouldn’t be the first
time you’d brought wild stuff to class, would it?”
The Slytherins murmured agreement and a few Gryffindors looked
as though they thought Malfoy had a fair point too.


443



CHAPTER TWENTY-ONE
“ ’Course they’re trained,” said Hagrid, scowling and hoisting the
dead cow a little higher on his shoulder.
“So what happened to your face, then?” demanded Malfoy.
“Mind yer own business!” said Hagrid, angrily. “Now if yeh’ve finished askin’ stupid questions, follow me!”
He turned and strode straight into the forest. Nobody seemed
much disposed to follow. Harry glanced at Ron and Hermione, who
sighed but nodded, and the three of them set off after Hagrid, leading
the rest of the class.
They walked for about ten minutes until they reached a place
where the trees stood so closely together that it was as dark as twilight
and there was no snow on the ground at all. Hagrid deposited his half
a cow with a grunt on the ground, stepped back, and turned to face
his class again, most of whom were creeping toward him from tree to
tree, peering around nervously as though expecting to be set upon at
any moment.
“Gather roun’, gather roun’,” said Hagrid encouragingly. “Now,
they’ll be attracted by the smell o’ the meat but I’m goin’ ter give ’em
a call anyway, ’cause they’ll like ter know it’s me. . . .”
He turned, shook his shaggy head to get the hair out of his face,
and gave an odd, shrieking cry that echoed through the dark trees like
the call of some monstrous bird. Nobody laughed; most of them
looked too scared to make a sound.
Hagrid gave the shrieking cry again. A minute passed in which the
class continued to peer nervously over their shoulders and around
trees for a first glimpse of whatever it was that was coming. And then,
as Hagrid shook his hair back for a third time and expanded his enormous chest, Harry nudged Ron and pointed into the black space between two gnarled yew trees.
A pair of blank, white, shining eyes were growing larger through
the gloom and a moment later the dragonish face, neck, and then
skeletal body of a great, black, winged horse emerged from the dark

444



THE EYE OF THE SNAKE
ness. It looked around at the class for a few seconds, swishing its long
black tail, then bowed its head and began to tear flesh from the dead
cow with its pointed fangs.
A great wave of relief broke over Harry. Here at last was proof that
he had not imagined these creatures, that they were real: Hagrid knew
about them too. He looked eagerly at Ron, but Ron was still staring
around into the trees and after a few seconds he whispered, “Why
doesn’t Hagrid call again?”
Most of the rest of the class were wearing expressions as confused
and nervously expectant as Ron’s and were still gazing everywhere but
at the horse standing feet from them. There were only two other people who seemed to be able to see them: a stringy Slytherin boy standing
just behind Goyle was watching the horse eating with an expression of
great distaste on his face, and Neville, whose eyes were following the
swishing progress of the long black tail.
“Oh, an’ here comes another one!” said Hagrid proudly, as a second
black horse appeared out of the dark trees, folded its leathery wings
closer to its body, and dipped its head to gorge on the meat. “Now . . .
put yer hands up, who can see ’em?”
Immensely pleased to feel that he was at last going to understand the
mystery of these horses, Harry raised his hand. Hagrid nodded at him.
“Yeah . . . yeah, I knew you’d be able ter, Harry,” he said seriously.
“An’ you too, Neville, eh? An’ —”
“Excuse me,” said Malfoy in a sneering voice, “but what exactly are
we supposed to be seeing?”
For answer, Hagrid pointed at the cow carcass on the ground. The
whole class stared at it for a few seconds, then several people gasped
and Parvati squealed. Harry understood why: Bits of flesh stripping
themselves away from the bones and vanishing into thin air had to
look very odd indeed.
“What’s doing it?” Parvati demanded in a terrified voice, retreating
behind the nearest tree. “What’s eating it?”


445



CHAPTER TWENTY-ONE
“Thestrals,” said Hagrid proudly and Hermione gave a soft “oh!” of
comprehension at Harry’s shoulder. “Hogwarts has got a whole herd
of ’em in here. Now, who knows — ?”
“But they’re really, really unlucky!” interrupted Parvati, looking
alarmed. “They’re supposed to bring all sorts of horrible misfortune
on people who see them. Professor Trelawney told me once —”
“No, no, no,” said Hagrid, chuckling, “tha’s jus’ superstition, that
is, they aren’ unlucky, they’re dead clever an’ useful! ’Course, this lot
don’ get a lot o’ work, it’s mainly jus’ pullin’ the school carriages unless Dumbledore’s takin’ a long journey an’ don’ want ter Apparate —
an’ here’s another couple, look —”
Two more horses came quietly out of the trees, one of them passing
very close to Parvati, who shivered and pressed herself closer to the
tree, saying, “I think I felt something, I think it’s near me!”
“Don’ worry, it won’ hurt yeh,” said Hagrid patiently. “Righ’, now,
who can tell me why some o’ you can see them an’ some can’t?”
Hermione raised her hand.
“Go on then,” said Hagrid, beaming at her.
“The only people who can see thestrals,” she said, “are people who
have seen death.”
“Tha’s exactly right,” said Hagrid solemnly, “ten points ter Gryffindor. Now, thestrals —”
“Hem, hem.”
Professor Umbridge had arrived. She was standing a few feet away
from Harry, wearing her green hat and cloak again, her clipboard at
the ready. Hagrid, who had never heard Umbridge’s fake cough before, was gazing in some concern at the closest thestral, evidently under the impression that it had made the sound.
“Hem, hem.”
“Oh hello!” Hagrid said, smiling, having located the source of the
noise.
“You received the note I sent to your cabin this morning?” said


446



THE EYE OF THE SNAKE
Umbridge, in the same loud, slow voice she had used with him earlier,
as though she was addressing somebody both foreign and very slow.
“Telling you that I would be inspecting your lesson?”
“Oh yeah,” said Hagrid brightly. “Glad yeh found the place all
righ’! Well, as you can see — or, I dunno — can you? We’re doin’
thestrals today —”
“I’m sorry?” said Umbridge loudly, cupping her hand around her
ear and frowning. “What did you say?”
Hagrid looked a little confused.
“Er — thestrals!” he said loudly. “Big — er — winged horses, yeh
know!”
He flapped his gigantic arms hopefully. Professor Umbridge raised
her eyebrows at him and muttered as she made a note on her clipboard,
“ ‘has . . . to . . . resort . . . to . . . crude . . . sign . . . language . . .’ ”
“Well . . . anyway . . .” said Hagrid, turning back to the class and
looking slightly flustered. “Erm . . . what was I sayin’?”
“ ‘Appears . . . to . . . have . . . poor . . . short . . . term . . . memory . . .’ ”
muttered Umbridge, loudly enough for everyone to hear her. Draco
Malfoy looked as though Christmas had come a month early; Hermione, on the other hand, had turned scarlet with suppressed rage.
“Oh yeah,” said Hagrid, throwing an uneasy glance at Umbridge’s
clipboard, but plowing on valiantly. “Yeah, I was gonna tell yeh how
come we got a herd. Yeah, so, we started off with a male an’ five females. This one,” he patted the first horse to have appeared, “name o’
Tenebrus, he’s my special favorite, firs’ one born here in the forest —”
“Are you aware,” Umbridge said loudly, interrupting him, “that the
Ministry of Magic has classified thestrals as ‘dangerous’?”
Harry’s heart sank like a stone, but Hagrid merely chuckled.
“Thestrals aren’ dangerous! All righ, they might take a bite outta
you if yeh really annoy them —”
“ ‘Shows . . . signs . . . of . . . pleasure . . . at . . . idea . . . of . . . violence . . . ’ ” muttered Umbridge, scribbling on her clipboard again.


CHAPTER TWENTY-ONE
“No — come on!” said Hagrid, looking a little anxious now. “I
mean, a dog’ll bite if yeh bait it, won’ it — but thestrals have jus’ got
a bad reputation because o’ the death thing — people used ter think
they were bad omens, didn’ they? Jus’ didn’ understand, did they?”
Umbridge did not answer; she finished writing her last note, then
looked up at Hagrid and said, again very loudly and slowly, “Please
continue teaching as usual. I am going to walk” — she mimed walking — Malfoy and Pansy Parkinson were having silent fits of laughter
— “among the students” — she pointed around at individual members of the class — “and ask them questions.” She pointed at her
mouth to indicate talking.
Hagrid stared at her, clearly at a complete loss to understand why
she was acting as though he did not understand normal English.
Hermione had tears of fury in her eyes now.
“You hag, you evil hag!” she whispered, as Umbridge walked toward Pansy Parkinson. “I know what you’re doing, you awful, twisted,
vicious —”
“Erm . . . anyway,” said Hagrid, clearly struggling to regain the
flow of his lesson, “so — thestrals. Yeah. Well, there’s loads o’ good
stuff abou’ them. . . .”
“Do you find,” said Professor Umbridge in a ringing voice to Pansy
Parkinson, “that you are able to understand Professor Hagrid when he
talks?”
Just like Hermione, Pansy had tears in her eyes, but these were tears
of laughter; indeed, her answer was almost incoherent because she was
trying to suppress her giggles. “No . . . because . . . well . . . it sounds
. . . like grunting a lot of the time. . . .”
Umbridge scribbled on her clipboard. The few unbruised bits of
Hagrid’s face flushed, but he tried to act as though he had not heard
Pansy’s answer.
“Er . . . yeah . . . good stuff abou’ thestrals. Well, once they’re


THE EYE OF THE SNAKE
tamed, like this lot, yeh’ll never be lost again. ‘Mazin’ senses o’ direction, jus’ tell ’em where yeh want ter go —”
“Assuming they can understand you, of course,” said Malfoy
loudly, and Pansy Parkinson collapsed in a fit of renewed giggles. Professor Umbridge smiled indulgently at them and then turned to
Neville.
“You can see the thestrals, Longbottom, can you?” she said.
Neville nodded.
“Whom did you see die?” she asked, her tone indifferent.
“My . . . my grandad,” said Neville.
“And what do you think of them?” she said, waving her stubby
hand at the horses, who by now had stripped a great deal of the carcass down to bone.
“Erm,” said Neville nervously, with a glance at Hagrid. “Well,
they’re . . . er . . . okay. . . .”
“ ‘Students . . . are . . . too . . . intimidated . . . to . . . admit . . . they
. . . are . . . frightened. . . .’ ” muttered Umbridge, making another
note on her clipboard.
“No!” said Neville, looking upset, “no, I’m not scared of them — !”
“It’s quite all right,” said Umbridge, patting Neville on the shoulder with what she evidently intended to be an understanding smile,
though it looked more like a leer to Harry. “Well, Hagrid,” she turned
to look up at him again, speaking once more in that loud, slow voice,
“I think I’ve got enough to be getting along with. . . . You will receive” — she mimed taking something from the air in front of her —
“the results of your inspection” — she pointed at the clipboard — “in
ten days’ time.” She held up ten stubby little fingers, then, her smile
wider and more toadlike than ever before beneath her green hat, she
bustled from their midst, leaving Malfoy and Pansy Parkinson in fits
of laughter, Hermione actually shaking with fury, and Neville looking
confused and upset.

“That foul, lying, twisting old gargoyle!” stormed Hermione half
an hour later, as they made their way back up to the castle through the
channels they had made earlier in the snow. “You see what she’s up to?
It’s her thing about half-breeds all over again — she’s trying to make
out Hagrid’s some kind of dim-witted troll, just because he had a giantess for a mother — and oh, it’s not fair, that really wasn’t a bad lesson at all — I mean, all right, if it had been Blast-Ended Skrewts
again, but thestrals are fine — in fact, for Hagrid, they’re really good!”
“Umbridge said they’re dangerous,” said Ron.
“Well, it’s like Hagrid said, they can look after themselves,” said
Hermione impatiently, “and I suppose a teacher like Grubbly-Plank
wouldn’t usually show them to us before N.E.W.T. level, but, well,
they are very interesting, aren’t they? The way some people can see
them and some can’t! I wish I could.”
“Do you?” Harry asked her quietly.
She looked horrorstruck.
“Oh Harry — I’m sorry — no, of course I don’t — that was a really stupid thing to say —”
“It’s okay,” he said quickly, “don’t worry. . . .”
“I’m surprised so many people could see them,” said Ron. “Three in
a class —”
“Yeah, Weasley, we were just wondering,” said a malicious voice
nearby. Unheard by any of them in the muffling snow, Malfoy,
Crabbe, and Goyle were walking along right behind them. “D’you
reckon if you saw someone snuff it you’d be able to see the Quaffle
better?”
He, Crabbe, and Goyle roared with laughter as they pushed past on
their way to the castle and then broke into a chorus of “Weasley Is
Our King.” Ron’s ears turned scarlet.
“Ignore them, just ignore them,” intoned Hermione, pulling out
her wand and performing the charm to produce hot air again, so that

she could melt them an easier path through the untouched snow between them and the greenhouses.
December arrived, bringing with it more snow and a positive
avalanche of homework for the fifth years. Ron and Hermione’s prefect duties also became more and more onerous as Christmas approached. They were called upon to supervise the decoration of the
castle (“You try putting up tinsel when Peeves has got the other end
and is trying to strangle you with it,” said Ron), to watch over first
and second years spending their break times inside because of the bitter cold (“And they’re cheeky little snotrags, you know, we definitely
weren’t that rude when we were in first year,” said Ron), and to patrol
the corridors in shifts with Argus Filch, who suspected that the holiday spirit might show itself in an outbreak of wizard duels (“He’s got
dung for brains, that one,” said Ron furiously). They were so busy that
Hermione had stopped knitting elf hats and was fretting that she was
down to her last three.
“All those poor elves I haven’t set free yet, having to stay over during Christmas because there aren’t enough hats!”
Harry, who had not had the heart to tell her that Dobby was taking
everything she made, bent lower over his History of Magic essay. In
any case, he did not want to think about Christmas. For the first time
in his school career, he very much wanted to spend the holidays away
from Hogwarts. Between his Quidditch ban and worry about whether
or not Hagrid was going to be put on probation, he felt highly resentful toward the place at the moment. The only thing he really looked
forward to were the D.A. meetings, and they would have to stop over
the holidays, as nearly everybody in the D.A. would be spending the
time with their families. Hermione was going skiing with her parents,
something that greatly amused Ron, who had never before heard of
Muggles strapping narrow strips of wood to their feet to slide down

mountains. Ron, meanwhile, was going home to the Burrow. Harry
endured several days of jealousy before Ron said, in response to Harry
asking how Ron was going to get home for Christmas, “But you’re
coming too! Didn’t I say? Mum wrote and told me to invite you weeks
ago!
Hermione rolled her eyes, but Harry’s spirits soared: The thought
of Christmas at the Burrow was truly wonderful, only slightly marred
by Harry’s guilty feeling that he would not be able to spend the holiday with Sirius. He wondered whether he could possibly persuade
Mrs. Weasley to invite his godfather for the festivities too, but apart
from the fact that he doubted whether Dumbledore would permit Sirius to leave Grimmauld Place, he could not help but feel that Mrs.
Weasley might not want him; they were so often at loggerheads. Sirius had not contacted Harry at all since his last appearance in the fire,
and although Harry knew that with Umbridge on the constant watch
it would be unwise to attempt to contact him, he did not like to think
of Sirius alone in his mother’s old house, perhaps pulling a lonely
cracker with Kreacher.
Harry arrived early in the Room of Requirement for the last D.A.
meeting before the holidays and was very glad he had, because when
the lamps burst into light he saw that Dobby had taken it upon himself to decorate the place for Christmas. He could tell the elf had done
it, because nobody else would have strung a hundred golden baubles
from the ceiling, each showing a picture of Harry’s face and bearing
the legend HAVE A VERY HARRY CHRISTMAS!
Harry had only just managed to get the last of them down before
the door creaked open and Luna Lovegood entered, looking dreamy
as always.
“Hello,” she said vaguely, looking around at what remained of the
decorations. “These are nice, did you put them up?”
“No,” said Harry, “it was Dobby the house-elf.”


THE EYE OF THE SNAKE
“Mistletoe,” said Luna dreamily, pointing at a large clump of white
berries placed almost over Harry’s head. He jumped out from under
it. “Good thinking,” said Luna very seriously. “It’s often infested with
nargles.”
Harry was saved the necessity of asking what nargles were by the
arrival of Angelina, Katie, and Alicia. All three of them were breathless and looked very cold.
“Well,” said Angelina dully, pulling off her cloak and throwing it
into a corner, “we’ve replaced you.”
“Replaced me?” said Harry blankly.
“You and Fred and George,” she said impatiently. “We’ve got another Seeker!”
“Who?” said Harry quickly.
“Ginny Weasley,” said Katie.
Harry gaped at her.
“Yeah, I know,” said Angelina, pulling out her wand and flexing her
arm. “But she’s pretty good, actually. Nothing on you, of course,” she
said, throwing him a very dirty look, “but as we can’t have you . . .”
Harry bit back the retort he was longing to utter: Did she imagine
for a second that he did not regret his expulsion from the team a hundred times more than she did?
“And what about the Beaters?” he asked, trying to keep his voice
even.
“Andrew Kirke,” said Alicia without enthusiasm, “and Jack Sloper.
Neither of them are brilliant, but compared with the rest of the idiots
who turned up . . .”
The arrival of Ron, Hermione, and Neville brought this depressing
discussion to an end and within five minutes, the room was full
enough to prevent him seeing Angelina’s burning, reproachful looks.
“Okay,” he said, calling them all to order. “I thought this evening
we should just go over the things we’ve done so far, because it’s the last

meeting before the holidays and there’s no point starting anything
new right before a three-week break —”
“We’re not doing anything new?” said Zacharias Smith, in a disgruntled whisper loud enough to carry through the room. “If I’d
known that, I wouldn’t have come. . . .”
“We’re all really sorry Harry didn’t tell you, then,” said Fred loudly.
Several people sniggered. Harry saw Cho laughing and felt the familiar swooping sensation in his stomach, as though he had missed a
step going downstairs.
“We can practice in pairs,” said Harry. “We’ll start with the Impediment Jinx, just for ten minutes, then we can get out the cushions
and try Stunning again.”
They all divided up obediently; Harry partnered Neville as usual.
The room was soon full of intermittent cries of “Impedimenta!” People
froze for a minute or so, during which their partners would stare
aimlessly around the room watching other pairs at work, then would
unfreeze and take their turn at the jinx.
Neville had improved beyond all recognition. After a while, when
Harry had unfrozen three times in a row, he had Neville join Ron and
Hermione again so that he could walk around the room and watch the
others. When he passed Cho she beamed at him; he resisted the temptation to walk past her several more times.
After ten minutes on the Impediment Jinx, they laid out cushions
all over the floor and started practicing Stunning again. Space was
really too confined to allow them all to work this spell at once; half the
group observed the others for a while, then swapped over. Harry felt
himself positively swelling with pride as he watched them all. True,
Neville did Stun Padma Patil rather than Dean, at whom he had been
aiming, but it was a much closer miss than usual, and everybody else
had made enormous progress.
At the end of an hour, Harry called a halt.


454

THE EYE OF THE SNAKE
“You’re getting really good,” he said, beaming around at them.
“When we get back from the holidays we can start doing some of the
big stuff — maybe even Patronuses.”
There was a murmur of excitement. The room began to clear in the
usual twos and threes; most people wished Harry a Happy Christmas
as they went. Feeling cheerful, he collected up the cushions with Ron
and Hermione and stacked them neatly away. Ron and Hermione left
before he did; he hung back a little, because Cho was still there and he
was hoping to receive a Merry Christmas from her.
“No, you go on,” he heard her say to her friend Marietta, and his
heart gave a jolt that seemed to take it into the region of his Adam’s
apple.
He pretended to be straightening the cushion pile. He was quite
sure they were alone now and waited for her to speak. Instead, he
heard a hearty sniff.
He turned and saw Cho standing in the middle of the room, tears
pouring down her face.
“Wha — ?”
He didn’t know what to do. She was simply standing there, crying
silently.
“What’s up?” he said feebly.
She shook her head and wiped her eyes on her sleeve. “I’m —
sorry,” she said thickly. “I suppose . . . it’s just . . . learning all this
stuff. . . . It just makes me . . . wonder whether . . . if he’d known it all
. . . he’d still be alive. . . .”
Harry’s heart sank right back past its usual spot and settled somewhere around his navel. He ought to have known. She wanted to talk
about Cedric.
“He did know this stuff,” Harry said heavily. “He was really good
at it, or he could never have got to the middle of that maze. But if
Voldemort really wants to kill you, you don’t stand a chance.”


CHAPTER TWENTY-ONE
She hiccuped at the sound of Voldemort’s name, but stared at
Harry without flinching.
“You survived when you were just a baby,” she said quietly.
“Yeah, well,” said Harry wearily, moving toward the door, “I dunno
why, nor does anyone else, so it’s nothing to be proud of.”
“Oh don’t go!” said Cho, sounding tearful again. “I’m really sorry
to get all upset like this. . . . I didn’t mean to. . . .”
She hiccuped again. She was very pretty even when her eyes were
red and puffy. Harry felt thoroughly miserable. He’d have been so
pleased just with a Merry Christmas. . . .
“I know it must be horrible for you,” she said, mopping her eyes on
her sleeve again. “Me mentioning Cedric, when you saw him die. . . .
I suppose you just want to forget about it. . . .”
Harry did not say anything to this; it was quite true, but he felt
heartless saying it.
“You’re a r-really good teacher, you know,” said Cho, with a watery
smile. “I’ve never been able to Stun anything before.”
“Thanks,” said Harry awkwardly.
They looked at each other for a long moment. Harry felt a burning
desire to run from the room and, at the same time, a complete inability to move his feet.
“Mistletoe,” said Cho quietly, pointing at the ceiling over his head.
“Yeah,” said Harry. His mouth was very dry. “It’s probably full of
nargles, though.”
“What are nargles?”
“No idea,” said Harry. She had moved closer. His brain seemed to
have been Stunned. “You’d have to ask Loony. Luna, I mean.”
Cho made a funny noise halfway between a sob and a laugh. She
was even nearer him now. He could have counted the freckles on her
nose.
“I really like you, Harry.”

THE EYE OF THE SNAKE
He could not think. A tingling sensation was spreading throughout
him, paralyzing his arms, legs, and brain.
She was much too close. He could see every tear clinging to her
eyelashes. . . .
He returned to the common room half an hour later to find
Hermione and Ron in the best seats by the fire; nearly everybody else
had gone to bed. Hermione was writing a very long letter; she had already filled half a roll of parchment, which was dangling from the
edge of the table. Ron was lying on the hearthrug, trying to finish his
Transfiguration homework.
“What kept you?” he asked, as Harry sank into the armchair next
to Hermione’s.
Harry did not answer. He was in a state of shock. Half of him
wanted to tell Ron and Hermione what had just happened, but the
other half wanted to take the secret with him to the grave.
“Are you all right, Harry?” Hermione asked, peering at him over
the tip of her quill.
Harry gave a halfhearted shrug. In truth, he didn’t know whether
he was all right or not. “What’s up?” said Ron, hoisting himself up on
his elbow to get a clearer view of Harry. “What’s happened?”
Harry didn’t quite know how to set about telling them, and still
wasn’t sure whether he wanted to. Just as he had decided not to say
anything, Hermione took matters out of his hands.
“Is it Cho?” she asked in a businesslike way. “Did she corner you after the meeting?”
Numbly surprised, Harry nodded. Ron sniggered, breaking off
when Hermione caught his eye.
“So — er — what did she want?” he asked in a mock casual voice.
“She —” Harry began, rather hoarsely; he cleared his throat and
tried again. “She — er —”

CHAPTER TWENTY-ONE
“Did you kiss?” asked Hermione briskly.
Ron sat up so fast that he sent his ink bottle flying all over the rug.
Disregarding this completely he stared avidly at Harry.
“Well?” he demanded.
Harry looked from Ron’s expression of mingled curiosity and hilarity to Hermione’s slight frown, and nodded.
“HA!”
Ron made a triumphant gesture with his fist and went into a raucous peal of laughter that made several timid-looking second years
over beside the window jump. A reluctant grin spread over Harry’s
face as he watched Ron rolling around on the hearthrug. Hermione
gave Ron a look of deep disgust and returned to her letter.
“Well?” Ron said finally, looking up at Harry. “How was it?”
Harry considered for a moment.
“Wet,” he said truthfully.
Ron made a noise that might have indicated jubilation or disgust,
it was hard to tell.
“Because she was crying,” Harry continued heavily.
“Oh,” said Ron, his smile fading slightly. “Are you that bad at
kissing?”
“Dunno,” said Harry, who hadn’t considered this, and immediately
felt rather worried. “Maybe I am.”
“Of course you’re not,” said Hermione absently, still scribbling
away at her letter.
“How do you know?” said Ron in a sharp voice.
“Because Cho spends half her time crying these days,” said Hermione vaguely. “She does it at mealtimes, in the loos, all over the
place.”
“You’d think a bit of kissing would cheer her up,” said Ron,
grinning.
“Ron,” said Hermione in a dignified voice, dipping the point of her


458

THE EYE OF THE SNAKE
quill into her ink pot, “you are the most insensitive wart I have ever
had the misfortune to meet.”
“What’s that supposed to mean?” said Ron indignantly. “What sort
of person cries while someone’s kissing them?”
“Yeah,” said Harry, slightly desperately, “who does?”
Hermione looked at the pair of them with an almost pitying expression on her face.
“Don’t you understand how Cho’s feeling at the moment?” she
asked.
“No,” said Harry and Ron together.
Hermione sighed and laid down her quill.
“Well, obviously, she’s feeling very sad, because of Cedric dying.
Then I expect she’s feeling confused because she liked Cedric and now
she likes Harry, and she can’t work out who she likes best. Then she’ll
be feeling guilty, thinking it’s an insult to Cedric’s memory to be kissing Harry at all, and she’ll be worrying about what everyone else
might say about her if she starts going out with Harry. And she probably can’t work out what her feelings toward Harry are anyway, because he was the one who was with Cedric when Cedric died, so that’s
all very mixed up and painful. Oh, and she’s afraid she’s going to be
thrown off the Ravenclaw Quidditch team because she’s been flying so
badly.”
A slightly stunned silence greeted the end of this speech, then Ron
said, “One person can’t feel all that at once, they’d explode.”
“Just because you’ve got the emotional range of a teaspoon doesn’t
mean we all have,” said Hermione nastily, picking up her quill again.
“She was the one who started it,” said Harry. “I wouldn’t’ve — she
just sort of came at me — and next thing she’s crying all over me — I
didn’t know what to do —”
“Don’t blame you, mate,” said Ron, looking alarmed at the very
thought.

CHAPTER TWENTY-ONE
“You just had to be nice to her,” said Hermione, looking up anxiously. “You were, weren’t you?”
“Well,” said Harry, an unpleasant heat creeping up his face, “I sort
of — patted her on the back a bit.”
Hermione looked as though she was restraining herself from rolling
her eyes with extreme difficulty.
“Well, I suppose it could have been worse,” she said. “Are you going to see her again?”
“I’ll have to, won’t I?” said Harry. “We’ve got D.A. meetings,
haven’t we?”
“You know what I mean,” said Hermione impatiently.
Harry said nothing. Hermione’s words opened up a whole new
vista of frightening possibilities. He tried to imagine going somewhere
with Cho — Hogsmeade, perhaps — and being alone with her for
hours at a time. Of course, she would have been expecting him to ask
her out after what had just happened. . . . The thought made his
stomach clench painfully.
“Oh well,” said Hermione distantly, buried in her letter once more,
“you’ll have plenty of opportunities to ask her. . . .”
“What if he doesn’t want to ask her?” said Ron, who had been
watching Harry with an unusually shrewd expression on his face.
“Don’t be silly,” said Hermione vaguely, “Harry’s liked her for ages,
haven’t you, Harry?”
He did not answer. Yes, he had liked Cho for ages, but whenever he
had imagined a scene involving the two of them it had always featured
a Cho who was enjoying herself, as opposed to a Cho who was sobbing uncontrollably into his shoulder.
“Who’re you writing the novel to anyway?” Ron asked Hermione,
trying to read the bit of parchment now trailing on the floor.
Hermione hitched it up out of sight.
“Viktor.”


460



THE EYE OF THE SNAKE
“Krum?”
“How many other Viktors do we know?”
Ron said nothing, but looked disgruntled. They sat in silence for
another twenty minutes, Ron finishing his Transfiguration essay with
many snorts of impatience and crossings-out, Hermione writing
steadily to the very end of the parchment, rolling it up carefully and
sealing it, and Harry staring into the fire, wishing more than anything
that Sirius’s head would appear there and give him some advice about
girls. But the fire merely crackled lower and lower, until the red-hot
embers crumbled into ash and, looking around, Harry saw that they
were, yet again, the last in the common room.
“Well, ’night,” said Hermione, yawning widely, and she set off up
the girls’ staircase.
“What does she see in Krum?” Ron demanded as he and Harry
climbed the boys’ stairs.
“Well,” said Harry, considering the matter, “I s’pose he’s older, isn’t
he . . . and he’s an international Quidditch player. . . .”
“Yeah, but apart from that,” said Ron, sounding aggravated. “I
mean he’s a grouchy git, isn’t he?”
“Bit grouchy, yeah,” said Harry, whose thoughts were still on Cho.
They pulled off their robes and put on pajamas in silence; Dean,
Seamus, and Neville were already asleep. Harry put his glasses on his
bedside table and got into bed but did not pull the hangings closed
around his four-poster; instead he stared at the patch of starry sky visible through the window next to Neville’s bed. If he had known, this
time last night, that in twenty-four hours’ time he would have kissed
Cho Chang . . .
“ ’Night,” grunted Ron, from somewhere to his right.
“ ’Night,” said Harry.
Maybe next time . . . if there was a next time . . . she’d be a bit
happier. He ought to have asked her out; she had probably been

CHAPTER TWENTY-ONE
expecting it and was now really angry with him . . . or was she lying in
bed, still crying about Cedric? He did not know what to think.
Hermione’s explanation had made it all seem more complicated rather
than easier to understand.
That’s what they should teach us here, he thought, turning over onto
his side, how girls’ brains work . . . it’d be more useful than Divination
anyway. . . .
Neville snuffled in his sleep. An owl hooted somewhere out in the
night.
Harry dreamed he was back in the D.A. room. Cho was accusing
him of luring her there under false pretenses; she said that he had
promised her a hundred and fifty Chocolate Frog cards if she showed
up. Harry protested. . . . Cho shouted, “Cedric gave me loads of Chocolate Frog cards, look !” And she pulled out fistfuls of cards from inside
her robes and threw them into the air, and then turned into
Hermione, who said, “You did promise her, you know, Harry. . . . I
think you’d better give her something else instead. . . . How about your
Firebolt?” And Harry was protesting that he could not give Cho his
Firebolt because Umbridge had it, and anyway the whole thing was
ridiculous, he’d only come to the D.A. room to put up some Christmas baubles shaped like Dobby’s head. . . .
The dream changed. . . .
His body felt smooth, powerful, and flexible. He was gliding between shining metal bars, across dark, cold stone. . . . He was flat
against the floor, sliding along on his belly. . . . It was dark, yet he
could see objects around him shimmering in strange, vibrant colors.
. . . He was turning his head. . . . At first glance, the corridor was
empty . . . but no . . . a man was sitting on the floor ahead, his chin
drooping onto his chest, his outline gleaming in the dark. . . .
Harry put out his tongue. . . . He tasted the man’s scent on the air.
. . . He was alive but drowsing . . . sitting in front of a door at the end
of the corridor . . .


THE EYE OF THE SNAKE
Harry longed to bite the man . . . but he must master the impulse.
. . . He had more important work to do. . . .
But the man was stirring . . . a silvery cloak fell from his legs as he
jumped to his feet; and Harry saw his vibrant, blurred outline towering above him, saw a wand withdrawn from a belt. . . . He had no
choice. . . . He reared high from the floor and struck once, twice,
three times, plunging his fangs deeply into the man’s flesh, feeling his
ribs splinter beneath his jaws, feeling the warm gush of blood. . . .
The man was yelling in pain . . . then he fell silent. . . . He slumped
backward against the wall. . . . Blood was splattering onto the floor. . . .
His forehead hurt terribly. . . . It was aching fit to burst. . . .
“Harry! HARRY!”
He opened his eyes. Every inch of his body was covered in icy
sweat; his bedcovers were twisted all around him like a straitjacket; he
felt as though a white-hot poker was being applied to his forehead.
“Harry!”
Ron was standing over him looking extremely frightened. There
were more figures at the foot of Harry’s bed. He clutched his head in
his hands; the pain was blinding him. . . . He rolled right over and
vomited over the edge of the mattress.
“He’s really ill,” said a scared voice. “Should we call someone?”
“Harry! Harry!”
He had to tell Ron, it was very important that he tell him. . . . Taking great gulps of air, Harry pushed himself up in bed, willing himself
not to throw up again, the pain half-blinding him.
“Your dad,” he panted, his chest heaving. “Your dad’s . . . been
attacked. . . .”
“What?” said Ron uncomprehendingly.
“Your dad! He’s been bitten, it’s serious, there was blood
everywhere. . . .”
“I’m going for help,” said the same scared voice, and Harry heard
footsteps running out of the dormitory.

“Harry, mate,” said Ron uncertainly, “you . . . you were just
dreaming. . . .”
“No!” said Harry furiously; it was crucial that Ron understand. “It
wasn’t a dream . . . not an ordinary dream. . . . I was there, I saw it.
. . . I did it. . . .”
He could hear Seamus and Dean muttering but did not care. The
pain in his forehead was subsiding slightly, though he was still sweating and shivering feverishly. He retched again and Ron leapt backward
out of the way.
“Harry, you’re not well,” he said shakily. “Neville’s gone for
help. . . .”
“I’m fine!” Harry choked, wiping his mouth on his pajamas and
shaking uncontrollably. “There’s nothing wrong with me, it’s your dad
you’ve got to worry about — we need to find out where he is — he’s
bleeding like mad — I was — it was a huge snake. . . .”
He tried to get out of bed but Ron pushed him back into it; Dean
and Seamus were still whispering somewhere nearby. Whether one
minute passed or ten, Harry did not know; he simply sat there shaking, feeling the pain recede very slowly from his scar. . . . Then there
were hurried footsteps coming up the stairs, and he heard Neville’s
voice again.
“Over here, Professor . . .”
Professor McGonagall came hurrying into the dormitory in her tartan dressing gown, her glasses perched lopsidedly on the bridge of her
bony nose.
“What is it, Potter? Where does it hurt?”
He had never been so pleased to see her; it was a member of the Order of the Phoenix he needed now, not someone fussing over him and
prescribing useless potions.
“It’s Ron’s dad,” he said, sitting up again. “He’s been attacked by a
snake and it’s serious, I saw it happen.”

“What do you mean, you saw it happen?” said Professor McGonagall, her dark eyebrows contracting.
“I don’t know. . . . I was asleep and then I was there. . . .”
“You mean you dreamed this?”
“No!” said Harry angrily. Would none of them understand? “I was
having a dream at first about something completely different, something stupid . . . and then this interrupted it. It was real, I didn’t imagine it, Mr. Weasley was asleep on the floor and he was attacked by a
gigantic snake, there was a load of blood, he collapsed, someone’s got
to find out where he is. . . .”
Professor McGonagall was gazing at him through her lopsided
spectacles as though horrified at what she was seeing.
“I’m not lying, and I’m not mad!” Harry told her, his voice rising to
a shout. “I tell you, I saw it happen!”
“I believe you, Potter,” said Professor McGonagall curtly. “Put on
your dressing-gown — we’re going to see the headmaster.”

H

arry was so relieved that she was taking him seriously that he
did not hesitate, but jumped out of bed at once, pulled on
his dressing gown, and pushed his glasses back onto his nose.
“Weasley, you ought to come too,” said Professor McGonagall.
They followed Professor McGonagall past the silent figures of
Neville, Dean, and Seamus, out of the dormitory, down the spiral
stairs into the common room, through the portrait hole, and off along
the Fat Lady’s moonlit corridor. Harry felt as though the panic inside
him might spill over at any moment; he wanted to run, to yell for
Dumbledore. Mr. Weasley was bleeding as they walked along so sedately, and what if those fangs (Harry tried hard not to think “my
fangs”) had been poisonous? They passed Mrs. Norris, who turned her
lamplike eyes upon them and hissed faintly, but Professor McGonagall said, “Shoo!” Mrs. Norris slunk away into the shadows, and in a
few minutes they had reached the stone gargoyle guarding the entrance to Dumbledore’s office.
“Fizzing Whizbee,” said Professor McGonagall.

ST. MUNGO’S HOSPITAL

AND INJURIES
The gargoyle sprang to life and leapt aside; the wall behind it split
in two to reveal a stone staircase that was moving continuously upward like a spiral escalator. The three of them stepped onto the moving stairs; the wall closed behind them with a thud, and they were
moving upward in tight circles until they reached the highly polished
oak door with the brass knocker shaped like a griffin.
Though it was now well past midnight, there were voices coming
from inside the room, a positive babble of them. It sounded as though
Dumbledore was entertaining at least a dozen people.
Professor McGonagall rapped three times with the griffin knocker,
and the voices ceased abruptly as though someone had switched them
all off. The door opened of its own accord and Professor McGonagall
led Harry and Ron inside.
The room was in half darkness; the strange silver instruments
standing on tables were silent and still rather than whirring and emitting puffs of smoke as they usually did. The portraits of old headmasters and headmistresses covering the walls were all snoozing in their
frames. Behind the door, a magnificent red-and-gold bird the size of a
swan dozed on its perch with its head under its wing.
“Oh, it’s you, Professor McGonagall . . . and . . . ah.”
Dumbledore was sitting in a high-backed chair behind his desk; he
leaned forward into the pool of candlelight illuminating the papers
laid out before him. He was wearing a magnificently embroidered
purple-and-gold dressing gown over a snowy-white nightshirt, but
seemed wide awake, his penetrating light-blue eyes fixed intently
upon Professor McGonagall.
“Professor Dumbledore, Potter has had a . . . well, a nightmare,”
said Professor McGonagall. “He says . . .”
“It wasn’t a nightmare,” said Harry quickly.
Professor McGonagall looked around at Harry, frowning slightly.
“Very well, then, Potter, you tell the headmaster about it.”
“I . . . well, I was asleep. . . .” said Harry and even in his terror and


CHAPTER TWENTY-TWO
his desperation to make Dumbledore understand he felt slightly irritated that the headmaster was not looking at him, but examining his
own interlocked fingers. “But it wasn’t an ordinary dream . . . it was
real. . . . I saw it happen. . . .” He took a deep breath, “Ron’s dad —
Mr. Weasley — has been attacked by a giant snake.”
The words seemed to reverberate in the air after he had said them,
slightly ridiculous, even comic. There was a pause in which Dumbledore leaned back and stared meditatively at the ceiling. Ron looked
from Harry to Dumbledore, white-faced and shocked.
“How did you see this?” Dumbledore asked quietly, still not looking at Harry.
“Well . . . I don’t know,” said Harry, rather angrily — what did it
matter? “Inside my head, I suppose —”
“You misunderstand me,” said Dumbledore, still in the same calm
tone. “I mean . . . can you remember — er — where you were positioned as you watched this attack happen? Were you perhaps standing
beside the victim, or else looking down on the scene from above?”
This was such a curious question that Harry gaped at Dumbledore;
it was almost as though he knew . . .
“I was the snake,” he said. “I saw it all from the snake’s point of
view. . . .”
Nobody else spoke for a moment, then Dumbledore, now looking
at Ron, who was still whey-faced, said in a new and sharper voice, “Is
Arthur seriously injured?”
“Yes,” said Harry emphatically — why were they all so slow on the
uptake, did they not realize how much a person bled when fangs that
long pierced their side? And why could Dumbledore not do him the
courtesy of looking at him?
But Dumbledore stood up so quickly that Harry jumped, and addressed one of the old portraits hanging very near the ceiling.
“Everard?” he said sharply. “And you too, Dilys!”
A sallow-faced wizard with short, black bangs and an elderly witch


with long silver ringlets in the frame beside him, both of whom
seemed to have been in the deepest of sleeps, opened their eyes
immediately.
“You were listening?” said Dumbledore.
The wizard nodded, the witch said, “Naturally.”
“The man has red hair and glasses,” said Dumbledore. “Everard,
you will need to raise the alarm, make sure he is found by the right
people —”
Both nodded and moved sideways out of their frames, but instead
of emerging in neighboring pictures (as usually happened at Hogwarts), neither reappeared; one frame now contained nothing but a
backdrop of dark curtain, the other a handsome leather armchair.
Harry noticed that many of the other headmasters and mistresses on
the walls, though snoring and drooling most convincingly, kept
sneaking peeks at him under their eyelids, and he suddenly understood who had been talking when they had knocked.
“Everard and Dilys were two of Hogwarts’s most celebrated Heads,”
Dumbledore said, now sweeping around Harry, Ron, and Professor
McGonagall and approaching the magnificent sleeping bird on his
perch beside the door. “Their renown is such that both have portraits
hanging in other important Wizarding institutions. As they are free to
move between their own portraits they can tell us what may be happening elsewhere. . . .”
“But Mr. Weasley could be anywhere!” said Harry.
“Please sit down, all three of you,” said Dumbledore, as though
Harry had not spoken. “Everard and Dilys may not be back for several
minutes. . . . Professor McGonagall, if you could draw up extra
chairs . . .”
Professor McGonagall pulled her wand from the pocket of her
dressing gown and waved it; three chairs appeared out of thin air,
straight-backed and wooden, quite unlike the comfortable chintz
armchairs that Dumbledore had conjured back at Harry’s hearing.


CHAPTER TWENTY-TWO
Harry sat down, watching Dumbledore over his shoulder. Dumbledore was now stroking Fawkes’s plumed golden head with one finger.
The phoenix awoke immediately. He stretched his beautiful head high
and observed Dumbledore through bright, dark eyes.
“We will need,” said Dumbledore very quietly to the bird, “a
warning.”
There was a flash of fire and the phoenix had gone.
Dumbledore now swooped down upon one of the fragile silver instruments whose function Harry had never known, carried it over to
his desk, sat down facing them again, and tapped it gently with the tip
of his wand.
The instrument tinkled into life at once with rhythmic clinking
noises. Tiny puffs of pale green smoke issued from the minuscule silver tube at the top. Dumbledore watched the smoke closely, his brow
furrowed, and after a few seconds, the tiny puffs became a steady
stream of smoke that thickened and coiled in the air. . . . A serpent’s
head grew out of the end of it, opening its mouth wide. Harry wondered whether the instrument was confirming his story: He looked
eagerly at Dumbledore for a sign that he was right, but Dumbledore
did not look up.
“Naturally, naturally,” murmured Dumbledore apparently to himself, still observing the stream of smoke without the slightest sign of
surprise. “But in essence divided?”
Harry could make neither head nor tail of this question. The
smoke serpent, however, split itself instantly into two snakes, both
coiling and undulating in the dark air. With a look of grim satisfaction
Dumbledore gave the instrument another gentle tap with his wand:
The clinking noise slowed and died, and the smoke serpents grew
faint, became a formless haze, and vanished.
Dumbledore replaced the instrument upon its spindly little table;
Harry saw many of the old headmasters in the portraits follow him
with their eyes, then, realizing that Harry was watching them, hastily


AND INJURIES
pretend to be sleeping again. Harry wanted to ask what the strange silver instrument was for, but before he could do so, there was a shout
from the top of the wall to their right; the wizard called Everard had
reappeared in his portrait, panting slightly.
“Dumbledore!”
“What news?” said Dumbledore at once.
“I yelled until someone came running,” said the wizard, who was
mopping his brow on the curtain behind him, “said I’d heard something moving downstairs — they weren’t sure whether to believe me
but went down to check — you know there are no portraits down
there to watch from. Anyway, they carried him up a few minutes later.
He doesn’t look good, he’s covered in blood, I ran along to Elfrida
Cragg’s portrait to get a good view as they left —”
“Good,” said Dumbledore as Ron made a convulsive movement, “I
take it Dilys will have seen him arrive, then —”
And moments later, the silver-ringletted witch had reappeared in
her picture too; she sank, coughing, into her armchair and said, “Yes,
they’ve taken him to St. Mungo’s, Dumbledore. . . . They carried him
past under my portrait. . . . He looks bad. . . .”
“Thank you,” said Dumbledore. He looked around at Professor
McGonagall.
“Minerva, I need you to go and wake the other Weasley children.”
“Of course. . . .”
Professor McGonagall got up and moved swiftly to the door; Harry
cast a sideways glance at Ron, who was now looking terrified.
“And Dumbledore — what about Molly?” said Professor McGonagall, pausing at the door.
“That will be a job for Fawkes when he has finished keeping a
lookout for anybody approaching,” said Dumbledore. “But she may
already know . . . that excellent clock of hers . . .”
Harry knew Dumbledore was referring to the clock that told, not
the time, but the whereabouts and conditions of the various Weasley


471



CHAPTER TWENTY-TWO
family members, and with a pang he thought that Mr. Weasley’s hand
must, even now, be pointing at “mortal peril.” But it was very late. . . .
Mrs. Weasley was probably asleep, not watching the clock. . . . And
he felt cold as he remembered Mrs. Weasley’s boggart turning into
Mr. Weasley’s lifeless body, his glasses askew, blood running down his
face. . . . But Mr. Weasley wasn’t going to die. . . . He couldn’t. . . .
Dumbledore was now rummaging in a cupboard behind Harry and
Ron. He emerged from it carrying a blackened old kettle, which he
placed carefully upon his desk. He raised his wand and murmured
“Portus”; for a moment the kettle trembled, glowing with an odd blue
light, then it quivered to a rest, as solidly black as ever.
Dumbledore marched over to another portrait, this time of a
clever-looking wizard with a pointed beard, who had been painted
wearing the Slytherin colors of green and silver and was apparently
sleeping so deeply that he could not hear Dumbledore’s voice when he
attempted to rouse him.
“Phineas. Phineas.”
And now the subjects of the portraits lining the room were no
longer pretending to be asleep; they were shifting around in their
frames, the better to watch what was happening. When the cleverlooking wizard continued to feign sleep, some of them shouted his
name too.
“Phineas! Phineas! PHINEAS!”
He could not pretend any longer; he gave a theatrical jerk and
opened his eyes wide.
“Did someone call?”
“I need you to visit your other portrait again, Phineas,” said Dumbledore. “I’ve got another message.”
“Visit my other portrait?” said Phineas in a reedy voice, giving a
long, fake yawn (his eyes traveling around the room and focusing
upon Harry). “Oh no, Dumbledore, I am too tired tonight. . . .”
Something about Phineas’s voice was familiar to Harry. Where had


472



he heard it before? But before he could think, the portraits on the surrounding walls broke into a storm of protest.
“Insubordination, sir!” roared a corpulent, red-nosed wizard, brandishing his fists. “Dereliction of duty!”
“We are honor-bound to give service to the present Headmaster of
Hogwarts!” cried a frail-looking old wizard whom Harry recognized as
Dumbledore’s predecessor, Armando Dippet. “Shame on you, Phineas!”
“Shall I persuade him, Dumbledore?” called a gimlet-eyed witch,
raising an unusually thick wand that looked not unlike a birch rod.
“Oh, very well,” said the wizard called Phineas, eyeing this wand
slightly apprehensively, “though he may well have destroyed my picture by now, he’s done most of the family —”
“Sirius knows not to destroy your portrait,” said Dumbledore, and
Harry realized immediately where he had heard Phineas’s voice before:
issuing from the apparently empty frame in his bedroom in Grimmauld Place. “You are to give him the message that Arthur Weasley
has been gravely injured and that his wife, children, and Harry Potter
will be arriving at his house shortly. Do you understand?”
“Arthur Weasley, injured, wife and children and Harry Potter
coming to stay,” recited Phineas in a bored voice. “Yes, yes . . . very
well. . . .”
He sloped away into the frame of the portrait and disappeared from
view at the very moment that the study door opened again. Fred,
George, and Ginny were ushered inside by Professor McGonagall, all
three of them looking disheveled and shocked, still in their night
things.
“Harry — what’s going on?” asked Ginny, who looked frightened.
“Professor McGonagall says you saw Dad hurt —”
“Your father has been injured in the course of his work for the Order of the Phoenix,” said Dumbledore before Harry could speak. “He
has been taken to St. Mungo’s Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries. I am sending you back to Sirius’s house, which is much more


473



CHAPTER TWENTY-TWO
convenient for the hospital than the Burrow. You will meet your
mother there.”
“How’re we going?” asked Fred, looking shaken. “Floo powder?”
“No,” said Dumbledore, “Floo powder is not safe at the moment,
the Network is being watched. You will be taking a Portkey.” He indicated the old kettle lying innocently on his desk. “We are just waiting
for Phineas Nigellus to report back. . . . I wish to be sure that the coast
is clear before sending you —”
There was a flash of flame in the very middle of the office, leaving
behind a single golden feather that floated gently to the floor.
“It is Fawkes’s warning,” said Dumbledore, catching the feather as
it fell. “She must know you’re out of your beds. . . . Minerva, go and
head her off — tell her any story —”
Professor McGonagall was gone in a swish of tartan.
“He says he’ll be delighted,” said a bored voice behind Dumbledore; the wizard called Phineas had reappeared in front of his
Slytherin banner. “My great-great-grandson has always had odd taste
in houseguests. . . .”
“Come here, then,” Dumbledore said to Harry and the Weasleys.
“And quickly, before anyone else joins us . . .”
Harry and the others gathered around Dumbledore’s desk.
“You have all used a Portkey before?” asked Dumbledore, and they
nodded, each reaching out to touch some part of the blackened kettle.
“Good. On the count of three then . . . one . . . two . . .”
It happened in a fraction of a second: In the infinitesimal pause before Dumbledore said “three,” Harry looked up at him — they were
very close together — and Dumbledore’s clear blue gaze moved from
the Portkey to Harry’s face.
At once, Harry’s scar burned white-hot, as though the old wound
had burst open again — and unbidden, unwanted, but terrifyingly
strong, there rose within Harry a hatred so powerful he felt, for that


FOR MAGICAL MALADIES
AND INJURIES
instant, that he would like nothing better than to strike — to bite —
to sink his fangs into the man before him —
“. . . three.”
He felt a powerful jerk behind his navel, the ground vanished from
beneath his feet, his hand was glued to the kettle; he was banging into
the others as all sped forward in a swirl of colors and a rush of wind,
the kettle pulling them onward and then —
His feet hit the ground so hard that his knees buckled, the kettle
clattered to the ground and somewhere close at hand a voice said,
“Back again, the blood traitor brats, is it true their father’s dying . . . ?”
“OUT!” roared a second voice.
Harry scrambled to his feet and looked around; they had arrived in
the gloomy basement kitchen of number twelve, Grimmauld Place.
The only sources of light were the fire and one guttering candle,
which illuminated the remains of a solitary supper. Kreacher was disappearing through the door to the hall, looking back at them malevolently as he hitched up his loincloth; Sirius was hurrying toward them
all, looking anxious. He was unshaven and still in his day clothes;
there was also a slightly Mundungus-like whiff of stale drink about
him.
“What’s going on?” he said, stretching out a hand to help Ginny
up. “Phineas Nigellus said Arthur’s been badly injured —”
“Ask Harry,” said Fred.
“Yeah, I want to hear this for myself,” said George.
The twins and Ginny were staring at him. Kreacher’s footsteps had
stopped on the stairs outside.
“It was —” Harry began; this was even worse than telling McGonagall and Dumbledore. “I had a — a kind of — vision. . . .”
And he told them all that he had seen, though he altered the story
so that it sounded as though he had watched from the sidelines as the
snake attacked, rather than from behind the snake’s own eyes. . . .


475

CHAPTER TWENTY-TWO
Ron, who was still very white, gave him a fleeting look, but did not
speak. When Harry had finished, Fred, George, and Ginny continued
to stare at him for a moment. Harry did not know whether he was
imagining it or not, but he fancied there was something accusatory in
their looks. Well, if they were going to blame him for just seeing the
attack, he was glad he had not told them that he had been inside the
snake at the time. . . .
“Is Mum here?” said Fred, turning to Sirius.
“She probably doesn’t even know what’s happened yet,” said Sirius.
“The important thing was to get you away before Umbridge could interfere. I expect Dumbledore’s letting Molly know now.”
“We’ve got to go to St. Mungo’s,” said Ginny urgently. She looked
around at her brothers; they were of course still in their pajamas. “Sirius, can you lend us cloaks or anything — ?”
“Hang on, you can’t go tearing off to St. Mungo’s!” said Sirius.
“ ’Course we can go to St. Mungo’s if we want,” said Fred, with a
mulish expression, “he’s our dad!”
“And how are you going to explain how you knew Arthur was attacked before the hospital even let his wife know?”
“What does that matter?” said George hotly.
“It matters because we don’t want to draw attention to the fact that
Harry is having visions of things that are happening hundreds of miles
away!” said Sirius angrily. “Have you any idea what the Ministry
would make of that information?”
Fred and George looked as though they could not care less what the
Ministry made of anything. Ron was still white-faced and silent.
Ginny said, “Somebody else could have told us. . . . We could have
heard it somewhere other than Harry. . . .”
“Like who?” said Sirius impatiently. “Listen, your dad’s been hurt
while on duty for the Order and the circumstances are fishy enough
without his children knowing about it seconds after it happened, you
could seriously damage the Order’s —”


476



ST. MUNGO’S HOSPITAL
FOR MAGICAL MALADIES
AND INJURIES
“We don’t care about the dumb Order!” shouted Fred.
“It’s our dad dying we’re talking about!” yelled George.
“Your father knew what he was getting into, and he won’t thank
you for messing things up for the Order!” said Sirius angrily in his
turn. “This is how it is — this is why you’re not in the Order — you
don’t understand — there are things worth dying for!”
“Easy for you to say, stuck here!” bellowed Fred. “I don’t see you
risking your neck!”
The little color remaining in Sirius’s face drained from it. He
looked for a moment as though he would quite like to hit Fred, but
when he spoke, it was in a voice of determined calm. “I know it’s hard,
but we’ve all got to act as though we don’t know anything yet. We’ve
got to stay put, at least until we hear from your mother, all right?”
Fred and George still looked mutinous. Ginny, however, took a few
steps over to the nearest chair and sank into it. Harry looked at Ron,
who made a funny movement somewhere between a nod and shrug,
and they sat down too. The twins glared at Sirius for another minute,
then took seats on either side of Ginny.
“That’s right,” said Sirius encouragingly, “come on, let’s all . . . let’s
all have a drink while we’re waiting. Accio Butterbeer!”
He raised his wand as he spoke and half a dozen bottles came flying
toward them out of the pantry, skidded along the table, scattering the
debris of Sirius’s meal, and stopped neatly in front of the six of them.
They all drank, and for a while the only sounds were those of the crackling of the kitchen fire and the soft thud of their bottles on the table.
Harry was only drinking to have something to do with his hands.
His stomach was full of horrible hot, bubbling guilt. They would not
be here if it were not for him; they would all still be asleep in bed. And
it was no good telling himself that by raising the alarm he had ensured
that Mr. Weasley was found, because there was also the inescapable
business of it being he who had attacked Mr. Weasley in the first
place. . . .


477



CHAPTER TWENTY-TWO
Don’t be stupid, you haven’t got fangs, he told himself, trying to keep
calm, though the hand on his butterbeer bottle was shaking. You were
lying in bed, you weren’t attacking anyone. . . .
But then, what just happened in Dumbledore’s office? he asked himself. I felt like I wanted to attack Dumbledore too. . . .
He put the bottle down on the table a little harder than he meant
to, so that it slopped over onto the table. No one took any notice.
Then a burst of fire in midair illuminated the dirty plates in front of
them and as they gave cries of shock, a scroll of parchment fell with a
thud onto the table, accompanied by a single golden phoenix tail
feather.
“Fawkes!” said Sirius at once, snatching up the parchment. “That’s
not Dumbledore’s writing — it must be a message from your
mother — here —”
He thrust the letter into George’s hand, who ripped it open and
read aloud, “Dad is still alive. I am setting out for St. Mungo’s now. Stay
where you are. I will send news as soon as I can. Mum.”
George looked around the table.
“Still alive . . .” he said slowly. “But that makes it sound . . .”
He did not need to finish the sentence. It sounded to Harry too as
though Mr. Weasley was hovering somewhere between life and death.
Still exceptionally pale, Ron stared at the back of his mother’s letter as
though it might speak words of comfort to him. Fred pulled the
parchment out of George’s hands and read it for himself, then looked
up at Harry, who felt his hand shaking on his butterbeer bottle again
and clenched it more tightly to stop the trembling.
If Harry had ever sat through a longer night than this one he could
not remember it. Sirius suggested once that they all go to bed, but
without any real conviction, and the Weasleys’ looks of disgust were
answer enough. They mostly sat in silence around the table, watching
the candle wick sinking lower and lower into liquid wax, now and
then raising bottles to their lips, speaking only to check the time, to


478



FOR MAGICAL MALADIES
AND INJURIES
wonder aloud what was happening, and to reassure one another that
if there was bad news, they would know straightaway, for Mrs.
Weasley must long since have arrived at St. Mungo’s.
Fred fell into a doze, his head sagging sideways onto his shoulder.
Ginny was curled like a cat on her chair, but her eyes were open;
Harry could see them reflecting the firelight. Ron was sitting with his
head in his hands, whether awake or asleep it was impossible to tell.
And he and Sirius looked at each other every so often, intruders upon
the family grief, waiting . . . waiting . . .
And then, at ten past five in the morning by Ron’s watch, the
kitchen door swung open and Mrs. Weasley entered the kitchen. She
was extremely pale, but when they all turned to look at her, Fred, Ron,
and Harry half-rising from their chairs, she gave a wan smile.
“He’s going to be all right,” she said, her voice weak with tiredness.
“He’s sleeping. We can all go and see him later. Bill’s sitting with him
now, he’s going to take the morning off work.”
Fred fell back into his chair with his hands over his face. George
and Ginny got up, walked swiftly over to their mother, and hugged
her. Ron gave a very shaky laugh and downed the rest of his butterbeer
in one.
“Breakfast!” said Sirius loudly and joyfully, jumping to his feet.
“Where’s that accursed house-elf? Kreacher! KREACHER!”
But Kreacher did not answer the summons.
“Oh, forget it, then,” muttered Sirius, counting the people in front
of him. “So it’s breakfast for — let’s see — seven . . . Bacon and eggs,
I think, and some tea, and toast —”
Harry hurried over to the stove to help. He did not want to intrude
upon the Weasleys’ happiness, and he dreaded the moment when
Mrs. Weasley would ask him to recount his vision. However, he had
barely taken plates from the dresser when Mrs. Weasley lifted them
out of his hands and pulled him into a hug.
“I don’t know what would have happened if it hadn’t been for you,


479



CHAPTER TWENTY-TWO
Harry,” she said in a muffled voice. “They might not have found
Arthur for hours, and then it would have been too late, but thanks to
you he’s alive and Dumbledore’s been able to think up a good cover
story for Arthur being where he was, you’ve no idea what trouble he
would have been in otherwise, look at poor Sturgis. . . .”
Harry could hardly stand her gratitude, but fortunately she soon
released him to turn to Sirius and thank him for looking after her children through the night. Sirius said that he was very pleased to have
been able to help, and hoped they would all stay with him as long as
Mr. Weasley was in hospital.
“Oh, Sirius, I’m so grateful. . . . They think he’ll be there a little
while and it would be wonderful to be nearer . . . Of course, that
might mean we’re here for Christmas. . . .”
“The more the merrier!” said Sirius with such obvious sincerity that
Mrs. Weasley beamed at him, threw on an apron, and began to help
with breakfast.
“Sirius,” Harry muttered, unable to stand it a moment longer.
“Can I have a quick word? Er — now?”
He walked into the dark pantry and Sirius followed. Without preamble Harry told his godfather every detail of the vision he had had,
including the fact that he himself had been the snake who had attacked Mr. Weasley.
When he paused for breath, Sirius said, “Did you tell Dumbledore
this?”
“Yes,” said Harry impatiently, “but he didn’t tell me what it meant.
Well, he doesn’t tell me anything anymore. . . .”
“I’m sure he would have told you if it was anything to worry
about,” said Sirius steadily.
“But that’s not all,” said Harry in a voice only a little above a whisper. “Sirius, I . . . I think I’m going mad. . . . Back in Dumbledore’s
office, just before we took the Portkey . . . for a couple of seconds


AND INJURIES
there I thought I was a snake, I felt like one — my scar really hurt
when I was looking at Dumbledore — Sirius, I wanted to attack
him —”
He could only see a sliver of Sirius’s face; the rest was in darkness.
“It must have been the aftermath of the vision, that’s all,” said Sirius. “You were still thinking of the dream or whatever it was and —”
“It wasn’t that,” said Harry, shaking his head. “It was like something rose up inside me, like there’s a snake inside me —”
“You need to sleep,” said Sirius firmly. “You’re going to have breakfast and then go upstairs to bed, and then you can go and see Arthur
after lunch with the others. You’re in shock, Harry; you’re blaming
yourself for something you only witnessed, and it’s lucky you did witness it or Arthur might have died. Just stop worrying. . . .”
He clapped Harry on the shoulder and left the pantry, leaving
Harry standing alone in the dark.
Everyone but Harry spent the rest of the morning sleeping. He went
up to the bedroom he had shared with Ron over the summer, but while
Ron crawled into bed and was asleep within minutes, Harry sat fully
clothed, hunched against the cold metal bars of the bedstead, keeping
himself deliberately uncomfortable, determined not to fall into a doze,
terrified that he might become the serpent again in his sleep and awake
to find that he had attacked Ron, or else slithered through the house
after one of the others. . . .
When Ron woke up, Harry pretended to have enjoyed a refreshing
nap too. Their trunks arrived from Hogwarts while they were eating
lunch, so that they could dress as Muggles for the trip to St. Mungo’s.
Everybody except Harry was riotously happy and talkative as they
changed out of their robes into jeans and sweatshirts, and they greeted
Tonks and Mad-Eye, who had turned up to escort them across London, gleefully laughing at the bowler hat Mad-Eye was wearing at an


481



CHAPTER TWENTY-TWO
angle to conceal his magical eye and assuring him, truthfully, that
Tonks, whose hair was short and bright pink again, would attract far
less attention on the underground.
Tonks was very interested in Harry’s vision of the attack on Mr.
Weasley, something he was not remotely interested in discussing.
“There isn’t any Seer blood in your family, is there?” she inquired
curiously, as they sat side by side on a train rattling toward the heart
of the city.
“No,” said Harry, thinking of Professor Trelawney and feeling
insulted.
“No,” said Tonks musingly, “no, I suppose it’s not really prophecy
you’re doing, is it? I mean, you’re not seeing the future, you’re seeing
the present. . . . It’s odd, isn’t it? Useful, though . . .”
Harry did not answer; fortunately they got out at the next stop, a
station in the very heart of London, and in the bustle of leaving the
train he was able to allow Fred and George to get between himself and
Tonks, who was leading the way. They all followed her up the escalator, Moody clunking along at the back of the group, his bowler tilted
low and one gnarled hand stuck in between the buttons of his coat,
clutching his wand. Harry thought he sensed the concealed eye staring hard at him; trying to deflect more questions about his dream he
asked Mad-Eye where St. Mungo’s was hidden.
“Not far from here,” grunted Moody as they stepped out into the
wintry air on a broad store-lined street packed with Christmas shoppers. He pushed Harry a little ahead of him and stumped along just
behind; Harry knew the eye was rolling in all directions under the
tilted hat. “Wasn’t easy to find a good location for a hospital. Nowhere
in Diagon Alley was big enough and we couldn’t have it underground
like the Ministry — unhealthy. In the end they managed to get hold of
a building up here. Theory was sick wizards could come and go and
just blend in with the crowd. . . .”


482



ST. MUNGO’S HOSPITAL
FOR MAGICAL MALADIES
AND INJURIES
He seized Harry’s shoulder to prevent them being separated by a
gaggle of shoppers plainly intent on nothing but making it into a
nearby shop full of electrical gadgets.
“Here we go,” said Moody a moment later.
They had arrived outside a large, old-fashioned, red brick department store called Purge and Dowse Ltd. The place had a shabby, miserable air; the window displays consisted of a few chipped dummies
with their wigs askew, standing at random and modeling fashions at
least ten years out of date. Large signs on all the dusty doors read
closed for refurbishment. Harry distinctly heard a large woman
laden with plastic shopping bags say to her friend as they passed, “It’s
never open, that place. . . .”
“Right,” said Tonks, beckoning them forward to a window displaying nothing but a particularly ugly female dummy whose false eyelashes were hanging off and who was modeling a green nylon pinafore
dress. “Everybody ready?”
They nodded, clustering around her; Moody gave Harry another
shove between the shoulder blades to urge him forward and Tonks
leaned close to the glass, looking up at the very ugly dummy and said,
her breath steaming up the glass, “Wotcher . . . We’re here to see
Arthur Weasley.”
For a split second, Harry thought how absurd it was for Tonks to expect the dummy to hear her talking that quietly through a sheet of
glass, when there were buses rumbling along behind her and all the
racket of a street full of shoppers. Then he reminded himself that dummies could not hear anyway. Next second his mouth opened in shock
as the dummy gave a tiny nod, beckoned its jointed finger, and Tonks
had seized Ginny and Mrs. Weasley by the elbows, stepped right
through the glass and vanished.
Fred, George, and Ron stepped after them; Harry glanced around
at the jostling crowd; not one of them seemed to have a glance to spare

for window displays as ugly as Purge and Dowse Ltd.’s, nor did any of
them seem to have noticed that six people had just melted into thin
air in front of them.
“C’mon,” growled Moody, giving Harry yet another poke in the
back and together they stepped forward through what felt like a sheet
of cool water, emerging quite warm and dry on the other side.
There was no sign of the ugly dummy or the space where she had
stood. They had arrived in what seemed to be a crowded reception
area where rows of witches and wizards sat upon rickety wooden
chairs, some looking perfectly normal and perusing out-of-date copies
of Witch Weekly, others sporting gruesome disfigurements such as elephant trunks or extra hands sticking out of their chests. The room was
scarcely less quiet than the street outside, for many of the patients were
making very peculiar noises. A sweaty-faced witch in the center of the
front row, who was fanning herself vigorously with a copy of the Daily
Prophet, kept letting off a high-pitched whistle as steam came pouring
out of her mouth, and a grubby-looking warlock in the corner clanged
like a bell every time he moved, and with each clang his head vibrated
horribly, so that he had to seize himself by the ears and hold it steady.
Witches and wizards in lime-green robes were walking up and
down the rows, asking questions and making notes on clipboards like
Umbridge’s. Harry noticed the emblem embroidered on their chests:
a wand and bone, crossed.
“Are they doctors?” he asked Ron quietly.
“Doctors?” said Ron, looking startled. “Those Muggle nutters that
cut people up? Nah, they’re Healers.”
“Over here!” called Mrs. Weasley over the renewed clanging of the
warlock in the corner, and they followed her to the queue in front of a
plump blonde witch seated at a desk marked inquiries. The wall behind her was covered in notices and posters saying things like a clean
cauldron keeps potions from becoming poisons and antidotes
are anti-don’ts unless approved by a qualified healer.

There was also a large portrait of a witch with long silver ringlets
that was labelled
DILYS DERWENT

headmistress of hogwarts school of
witchcraft and wizardry, i74i–i768
Dilys was eyeing the Weasley party as though counting them; when
Harry caught her eye she gave a tiny wink, walked sideways out of her
portrait, and vanished.
Meanwhile, at the front of the queue, a young wizard was performing an odd on-the-spot jig and trying, in between yelps of pain, to
explain his predicament to the witch behind the desk.
“It’s these — ouch — shoes my brother gave me — ow — they’re
eating my — OUCH — feet — look at them, there must be some
kind of — AARGH — jinx on them and I can’t — AAAAARGH —
get them off —”
He hopped from one foot to the other as though dancing on hot
coals.
“The shoes don’t prevent you reading, do they?” said the blonde
witch irritably, pointing at a large sign to the left of her desk. “You
want Spell Damage, fourth floor. Just like it says on the floor guide.
Next!”
The wizard hobbled and pranced sideways out of the way, the
Weasley party moved forward a few steps and Harry read the floor

A very old, stooped wizard with a hearing trumpet had shuffled to
the front of the queue now.
“I’m here to see Broderick Bode!” he wheezed.
“Ward forty-nine, but I’m afraid you’re wasting your time,” said the
witch dismissively “He’s completely addled, you know, still thinks he’s
a teapot. . . . Next!”
A harassed-looking wizard was holding his small daughter tightly
by the ankle while she flapped around his head using the immensely
large, feathery wings that had sprouted right out the back of her
romper suit.
“Fourth floor,” said the witch in a bored voice, without asking, and
the man disappeared through the double doors beside the desk, holding his daughter like an oddly shaped balloon. “Next!”
Mrs. Weasley moved forward to the desk.
“Hello,” she said. “My husband, Arthur Weasley, was supposed to
be moved to a different ward this morning, could you tell us — ?”
“Arthur Weasley?” said the witch, running her finger down a long

list in front of her. “Yes, first floor, second door on the right, Dai
Llewellyn ward.”
“Thank you,” said Mrs. Weasley. “Come on, you lot.”
They followed through the double doors and along the narrow corridor beyond, which was lined with more portraits of famous Healers
and lit by crystal bubbles full of candles that floated up on the ceiling,
looking like giant soapsuds. More witches and wizards in lime-green
robes walked in and out of the doors they passed; a foul-smelling yellow gas wafted into the passageway as they passed one door, and every
now and then they heard distant wailing. They climbed a flight of
stairs and entered the “Creature-Induced Injuries” corridor, where the
second door on the right bore the words “dangerous” dai llewellyn
ward: serious bites. Underneath this was a card in a brass holder on
which had been handwritten Healer-in-Charge: Hippocrates Smethwyck, Trainee Healer: Augustus Pye.
“We’ll wait outside, Molly,” Tonks said. “Arthur won’t want too
many visitors at once. . . . It ought to be just the family first.”
Mad-Eye growled his approval of this idea and set himself with his
back against the corridor wall, his magical eye spinning in all directions. Harry drew back too, but Mrs. Weasley reached out a hand and
pushed him through the door, saying, “Don’t be silly, Harry, Arthur
wants to thank you. . . .”
The ward was small and rather dingy as the only window was narrow
and set high in the wall facing the door. Most of the light came from
more shining crystal bubbles clustered in the middle of the ceiling. The
walls were of panelled oak and there was a portrait of a rather viciouslooking wizard on the wall, captioned urquhart rackharrow, 1612–
1697, inventor of the entrail-expelling curse.
There were only three patients. Mr. Weasley was occupying the bed
at the far end of the ward beside the tiny window. Harry was pleased and
relieved to see that he was propped up on several pillows and reading the


487



CHAPTER TWENTY-TWO
Daily Prophet by the solitary ray of sunlight falling onto his bed. He
looked around as they walked toward him and, seeing whom it was,
beamed.
“Hello!” he called, throwing the Prophet aside. “Bill just left, Molly,
had to get back to work, but he says he’ll drop in on you later. . . .”
“How are you, Arthur?” asked Mrs. Weasley, bending down to kiss
his cheek and looking anxiously into his face. “You’re still looking a bit
peaky. . . .”
“I feel absolutely fine,” said Mr. Weasley brightly, holding out his
good arm to give Ginny a hug. “If they could only take the bandages
off, I’d be fit to go home.”
“Why can’t they take them off, Dad?” asked Fred.
“Well, I start bleeding like mad every time they try,” said Mr.
Weasley cheerfully, reaching across for his wand, which lay on his bedside cabinet, and waving it so that six extra chairs appeared at his bedside to seat them all. “It seems there was some rather unusual kind of
poison in that snake’s fangs that keeps wounds open. . . . They’re sure
they’ll find an antidote, though, they say they’ve had much worse
cases than mine, and in the meantime I just have to keep taking a
Blood-Replenishing Potion every hour. But that fellow over there,” he
said, dropping his voice and nodding toward the bed opposite in
which a man lay looking green and sickly and staring at the ceiling.
“Bitten by a werewolf, poor chap. No cure at all.”
“A werewolf?” whispered Mrs. Weasley, looking alarmed. “Is he
safe in a public ward? Shouldn’t he be in a private room?”
“It’s two weeks till full moon,” Mr. Weasley reminded her quietly.
“They’ve been talking to him this morning, the Healers, you know,
trying to persuade him he’ll be able to lead an almost normal life. I
said to him — didn’t mention names, of course — but I said I knew a
werewolf personally, very nice man, who finds the condition quite
easy to manage. . . .”
“What did he say?” asked George.


488



ST. MUNGO’S HOSPITAL
FOR MAGICAL MALADIES
AND INJURIES
“Said he’d give me another bite if I didn’t shut up,” said Mr. Weasley
sadly. “And that woman over there,” he indicated the only other occupied bed, which was right beside the door, “won’t tell the Healers what
bit her, which makes us all think it must have been something she was
handling illegally. Whatever it was took a real chunk out of her leg,
very nasty smell when they take off the dressings.”
“So, you going to tell us what happened, Dad?” asked Fred, pulling
his chair closer to the bed.
“Well, you already know, don’t you?” said Mr. Weasley, with a significant smile at Harry. “It’s very simple — I’d had a very long day,
dozed off, got sneaked up on, and bitten.”
“Is it in the Prophet, you being attacked?” asked Fred, indicating the
newspaper Mr. Weasley had cast aside.
“No, of course not,” said Mr. Weasley, with a slightly bitter smile,
“the Ministry wouldn’t want everyone to know a dirty great serpent
got —”
“Arthur!” said Mrs. Weasley warningly.
“— got — er — me,” Mr. Weasley said hastily, though Harry was
quite sure that was not what he had meant to say.
“So where were you when it happened, Dad?” asked George.
“That’s my business,” said Mr. Weasley, though with a small smile.
He snatched up the Daily Prophet, shook it open again and said, “I
was just reading about Willy Widdershins’s arrest when you arrived.
You know Willy turned out to be behind those regurgitating toilets
last summer? One of his jinxes backfired, the toilet exploded, and they
found him lying unconscious in the wreckage covered from head to
foot in —”
“When you say you were ‘on duty,’ ” Fred interrupted in a low
voice, “what were you doing?”
“You heard your father,” whispered Mrs. Weasley, “we are not discussing this here! Go on about Willy Widdershins, Arthur —”
“Well, don’t ask me how, but he actually got off on the toilet

charge,” said Mr. Weasley grimly. “I can only suppose gold changed
hands —”
“You were guarding it, weren’t you?” said George quietly. “The
weapon? The thing You-Know-Who’s after?”
“George, be quiet!” snapped Mrs. Weasley.
“Anyway,” said Mr. Weasley in a raised voice, “this time Willy’s
been caught selling biting doorknobs to Muggles, and I don’t think
he’ll be able to worm his way out of it because according to this article, two Muggles have lost fingers and are now in St. Mungo’s for
emergency bone regrowth and memory modification. Just think of it,
Muggles in St. Mungo’s! I wonder which ward they’re in?”
And he looked eagerly around as though hoping to see a signpost.
“Didn’t you say You-Know-Who’s got a snake, Harry?” asked Fred,
looking at his father for a reaction. “A massive one? You saw it the
night he returned, didn’t you?”
“That’s enough,” said Mrs. Weasley crossly. “Mad-Eye and Tonks
are outside, Arthur, they want to come and see you. And you lot can
wait outside,” she added to her children and Harry. “You can come
and say good-bye afterward. Go on. . . .”
They trooped back into the corridor. Mad-Eye and Tonks went in
and closed the door of the ward behind them. Fred raised his eyebrows.
“Fine,” he said coolly, rummaging in his pockets, “be like that.
Don’t tell us anything.”
“Looking for these?” said George, holding out what looked like a
tangle of flesh-colored string.
“You read my mind,” said Fred, grinning. “Let’s see if St. Mungo’s
puts Imperturbable Charms on its ward doors, shall we?”
He and George disentangled the string and separated five Extendable Ears from each other. Fred and George handed them around.
Harry hesitated to take one.
“Go on, Harry, take it! You saved Dad’s life, if anyone’s got the right
to eavesdrop on him it’s you. . . .”


490



ST. MUNGO’S HOSPITAL
FOR MAGICAL MALADIES
AND INJURIES
Grinning in spite of himself, Harry took the end of the string and
inserted it into his ear as the twins had done.
“Okay, go!” Fred whispered.
The flesh-colored strings wriggled like long skinny worms, then
snaked under the door. For a few seconds Harry could hear nothing,
then he heard Tonks whispering as clearly as though she were standing right beside him.
“. . . they searched the whole area but they couldn’t find the snake
anywhere, it just seems to have vanished after it attacked you, Arthur.
. . . But You-Know-Who can’t have expected a snake to get in, can
he?”
“I reckon he sent it as a lookout,” growled Moody, “ ’cause he’s not
had any luck so far, has he? No, I reckon he’s trying to get a clearer picture of what he’s facing and if Arthur hadn’t been there the beast
would’ve had much more time to look around. So Potter says he saw
it all happen?”
“Yes,” said Mrs. Weasley. She sounded rather uneasy. “You know,
Dumbledore seems almost to have been waiting for Harry to see
something like this. . . .”
“Yeah, well,” said Moody, “there’s something funny about the
Potter kid, we all know that.”
“Dumbledore seemed worried about Harry when I spoke to him
this morning,” whispered Mrs. Weasley.
“ ’Course he’s worried,” growled Moody. “The boy’s seeing things
from inside You-Know-Who’s snake. . . . Obviously, Potter doesn’t realize what that means, but if You-Know-Who’s possessing him —”
Harry pulled the Extendable Ear out of his own, his heart hammering very fast and heat rushing up his face. He looked around at the
others. They were all staring at him, the strings still trailing from their
ears, looking suddenly fearful.

as this why Dumbledore would no longer meet Harry’s
eyes? Did he expect to see Voldemort staring out of them,
afraid, perhaps, that their vivid green might turn suddenly to scarlet,
with catlike slits for pupils? Harry remembered how the snakelike face
of Voldemort had once forced itself out of the back of Professor Quirrell’s head, and he ran his hand over the back of his own, wondering
what it would feel like if Voldemort burst out of his skull. . . .
He felt dirty, contaminated, as though he were carrying some
deadly germ, unworthy to sit on the underground train back from the
hospital with innocent, clean people whose minds and bodies were
free of the taint of Voldemort. . . . He had not merely seen the snake,
he had been the snake, he knew it now. . . .
And then a truly terrible thought occurred to him, a memory bobbing to the surface of his mind, one that made his insides writhe and
squirm like serpents. . . .
“What’s he after apart from followers?”
“Stuff he can only get by stealth . . . like a weapon. Something he didn’t
have last time.”


492



CHRISTMAS ON THE
CLOSED WARD
I’m the weapon, Harry thought, and it was as though poison were
pumping through his veins, chilling him, bringing him out in a sweat
as he swayed with the train through the dark tunnel. I’m the one Voldemort’s trying to use, that’s why they’ve got guards around me everywhere I
go, it’s not for my protection, it’s for other people’s, only it’s not working,
they can’t have someone on me all the time at Hogwarts. . . . I did attack
Mr. Weasley last night, it was me, Voldemort made me do it and he could
be inside me, listening to my thoughts right now. . . .
“Are you all right, Harry, dear?” whispered Mrs. Weasley, leaning
across Ginny to speak to him as the train rattled along through its
dark tunnel. “You don’t look very well. Are you feeling sick?”
They were all watching him. He shook his head violently and
stared up at an advertisement for home insurance.
“Harry, dear, are you sure you’re all right?” said Mrs. Weasley in a
worried voice, as they walked around the unkempt patch of grass in
the middle of Grimmauld Place. “You look ever so pale. . . . Are you
sure you slept this morning? You go upstairs to bed right now, and
you can have a couple of hours’ sleep before dinner, all right?”
He nodded; here was a ready-made excuse not to talk to any of the
others, which was precisely what he wanted, so when she opened the
front door he proceeded straight past the troll’s leg umbrella stand and
up the stairs and hurried into his and Ron’s bedroom.
Here he began to pace up and down, past the two beds and Phineas
Nigellus’s empty portrait, his brain teeming and seething with questions and ever more dreadful ideas. . . .
How had he become a snake? Perhaps he was an Animagus. . . .
No, he couldn’t be, he would know. . . . perhaps Voldemort was an
Animagus. . . . Yes, thought Harry, that would fit, he would turn into
a snake of course . . . and when he’s possessing me, then we both transform. . . . That still doesn’t explain how come I got to London and back
to my bed in the space of about five minutes, though. . . . But then
Voldemort’s about the most powerful wizard in the world, apart from


493



CHAPTER TWENTY-THREE
Dumbledore, it’s probably no problem at all to him to transport people
like that. . . .
And then, with a terrible stab of panic he thought, but this is insane — if Voldemort’s possessing me, I’m giving him a clear view into the
headquarters of the Order of the Phoenix right now! He’ll know who’s in
the Order and where Sirius is . . . and I’ve heard loads of stuff I shouldn’t
have, everything Sirius told me the first night I was here. . . .
There was only one thing for it: He would have to leave Grimmauld Place straightaway. He would spend Christmas at Hogwarts
without the others, which would keep them safe over the holidays at
least. . . . But no, that wouldn’t do, there were still plenty of people at
Hogwarts to maim and injure, what if it was Seamus, Dean, or Neville
next time? He stopped his pacing and stood staring at Phineas Nigellus’s empty frame. A leaden sensation was settling in the pit of his
stomach. He had no alternative: He was going to have to return to
Privet Drive, cut himself off from other wizards entirely. . . .
Well, if he had to do it, he thought, there was no point hanging
around. Trying with all his might not to think how the Dursleys were
going to react when they found him on their doorstep six months earlier than they had expected, he strode over to his trunk, slammed the
lid shut and locked it, then glanced around automatically for Hedwig
before remembering that she was still at Hogwarts — well, her cage
would be one less thing to carry — he seized one end of his trunk and
had dragged it halfway toward the door when a sneaky voice said,
“Running away, are we?”
He looked around. Phineas Nigellus had appeared upon the canvas
of his portrait and was leaning against the frame, watching Harry with
an amused expression on his face.
“Not running away, no,” said Harry shortly, dragging his trunk a
few more feet across the room.
“I thought,” said Phineas Nigellus, stroking his pointed beard,
“that to belong in Gryffindor House you were supposed to be brave?


494



CHRISTMAS ON THE

It looks to me as though you would have been better off in my own
house. We Slytherins are brave, yes, but not stupid. For instance,
given the choice, we will always choose to save our own necks.”
“It’s not my own neck I’m saving,” said Harry tersely, tugging the
trunk over a patch of particularly uneven, moth-eaten carpet right in
front of the door.
“Oh I see,” said Phineas Nigellus, still stroking his beard. “This is
no cowardly flight — you are being noble.”
Harry ignored him. His hand was on the doorknob when Phineas
Nigellus said lazily, “I have a message for you from Albus Dumbledore.”
Harry spun around.
“What is it?”
“Stay where you are.”
“I haven’t moved!” said Harry, his hand still upon the doorknob.
“So what’s the message?”
“I have just given it to you, dolt,” said Phineas Nigellus smoothly.
“Dumbledore says, ‘Stay where you are.’ ”
“Why?” said Harry eagerly, dropping the end of his trunk. “Why
does he want me to stay? What else did he say?”
“Nothing whatsoever,” said Phineas Nigellus, raising a thin black
eyebrow as though he found Harry impertinent.
Harry’s temper rose to the surface like a snake rearing from long
grass. He was exhausted, he was confused beyond measure, he had experienced terror, relief, and then terror again in the last twelve hours,
and still Dumbledore did not want to talk to him!
“So that’s it, is it?” he said loudly. “Stay there? That’s all anyone
could tell me after I got attacked by those dementors too! Just stay put
while the grown-ups sort it out, Harry! We won’t bother telling you
anything, though, because your tiny little brain might not be able to
cope with it!”
“You know,” said Phineas Nigellus, even more loudly than Harry,
“this is precisely why I loathed being a teacher! Young people are so


495

CHAPTER TWENTY-THREE
infernally convinced that they are absolutely right about everything.
Has it not occurred to you, my poor puffed-up popinjay, that there
might be an excellent reason why the headmaster of Hogwarts is not
confiding every tiny detail of his plans to you? Have you never paused,
while feeling hard-done-by, to note that following Dumbledore’s orders has never yet led you into harm? No. No, like all young people,
you are quite sure that you alone feel and think, you alone recognize
danger, you alone are the only one clever enough to realize what the
Dark Lord may be planning. . . .”
“He is planning something to do with me, then?” said Harry
swiftly.
“Did I say that?” said Phineas Nigellus, idly examining his silk
gloves. “Now, if you will excuse me, I have better things to do than to
listen to adolescent agonizing. . . . Good day to you. . . .”
And he strolled into his frame and out of sight.
“Fine, go then!” Harry bellowed at the empty frame. “And tell
Dumbledore thanks for nothing!”
The empty canvas remained silent. Fuming, Harry dragged his
trunk back to the foot of his bed, then threw himself facedown upon
the moth-eaten covers, his eyes shut, his body heavy and aching. . . .
He felt he had journeyed miles and miles. . . . It seemed impossible
that less than twenty-four hours ago Cho Chang had been approaching him under the mistletoe. . . . He was so tired. . . . He was scared to
sleep . . . yet he did not know how long he could fight it. . . . Dumbledore had told him to stay. . . . That must mean he was allowed to
sleep. . . . But he was scared. . . . What if it happened again . . . ?
He was sinking into shadows. . . .
It was as though a film in his head had been waiting to start. He
was walking down a deserted corridor toward a plain black door, past
rough stone walls, torches, and an open doorway onto a flight of stone
steps leading downstairs on the left. . . .
He reached the black door but could not open it. . . . He stood gaz

ing at it, desperate for entry. . . . Something he wanted with all his heart
lay beyond. . . . A prize beyond his dreams. . . . If only his scar would
stop prickling . . . then he would be able to think more clearly. . . .
“Harry,” said Ron’s voice, from far, far away, “Mum says dinner’s
ready, but she’ll save you something if you want to stay in bed. . . .”
Harry opened his eyes, but Ron had already left the room.
He doesn’t want to be on his own with me, Harry thought. Not after
what he heard Moody say . . .
He supposed none of them would want him there anymore now
that they knew what was inside him. . . .
He would not go down to dinner; he would not inflict his company
upon them. He turned over onto his other side and after a while
dropped back off to sleep, waking much later in the early hours of the
morning, with his insides aching with hunger, and Ron snoring in the
next bed. Squinting around the room he saw the dark outline of
Phineas Nigellus standing again in his portrait and it occurred to
Harry that Dumbledore had probably set Phineas Nigellus to watch
over him, in case he attacked somebody else.
The feeling of being unclean intensified. He half wished he had not
obeyed Dumbledore and stayed. . . . If this was how life was going to
be in Grimmauld Place from now on, maybe he would be better off in
Privet Drive after all.
Everybody else spent the following morning putting up Christmas
decorations. Harry could not remember Sirius ever being in such a
good mood; he was actually singing carols, apparently delighted that
he was to have company over Christmas. Harry could hear his voice
echoing up through the floor in the cold and empty drawing room
where he was sitting alone, watching the sky outside the windows
growing whiter, threatening snow, all the time feeling a savage pleasure that he was giving the others the opportunity to keep talking
about him, as they were bound to be doing. When he heard Mrs.


CHAPTER TWENTY-THREE
Weasley calling his name softly up the stairs around lunchtime he retreated farther upstairs and ignored her.
It was around six o’clock in the evening that the doorbell rang and
Mrs. Black started screaming again. Assuming that Mundungus or
some other Order member had come to call, Harry merely settled
himself more comfortably against the wall of Buckbeak the hippogriff’s room where he was hiding, trying to ignore how hungry he
felt as he fed Buckbeak dead rats. It came as a slight shock when somebody hammered hard on the door a few minutes later.
“I know you’re in there,” said Hermione’s voice. “Will you please
come out? I want to talk to you.”
“What are you doing here?” Harry asked her, pulling open the door,
as Buckbeak resumed his scratching at the straw-strewn floor for any
fragments of rat he might have dropped. “I thought you were skiing
with your mum and dad.”
“Well, to tell the truth, skiing’s not really my thing,” said Hermione. “So I’ve come for Christmas.” There was snow in her hair and her
face was pink with cold. “But don’t tell Ron that, I told him it’s really
good because he kept laughing so much. Anyway, Mum and Dad are
a bit disappointed, but I’ve told them that everyone who’s serious
about the exams is staying at Hogwarts to study. They want me to do
well, they’ll understand. Anyway,” she said briskly, “let’s go to your
bedroom, Ron’s mum’s lit a fire in there and she’s sent up sandwiches.”
Harry followed her back to the second floor. When he entered the
bedroom he was rather surprised to see both Ron and Ginny waiting
for them, sitting on Ron’s bed.
“I came on the Knight Bus,” said Hermione airily, pulling off her
jacket before Harry had time to speak. “Dumbledore told me what
had happened first thing this morning, but I had to wait for term to
end officially before setting off. Umbridge is already livid that you lot
disappeared right under her nose, even though Dumbledore told her

Mr. Weasley was in St. Mungo’s, and he’d given you all permission to
visit. So . . .”
She sat down next to Ginny, and the two girls and Ron looked up
at Harry.
“How’re you feeling?” asked Hermione.
“Fine,” said Harry stiffly.
“Oh, don’t lie, Harry,” she said impatiently. “Ron and Ginny say
you’ve been hiding from everyone since you got back from St.
Mungo’s.”
“They do, do they?” said Harry, glaring at Ron and Ginny. Ron
looked down at his feet but Ginny seemed quite unabashed.
“Well, you have!” she said. “And you won’t look at any of us!”
“It’s you lot who won’t look at me!” said Harry angrily.
“Maybe you’re taking it in turns to look and keep missing each
other,” suggested Hermione, the corners of her mouth twitching.
“Very funny,” snapped Harry, turning away.
“Oh, stop feeling all misunderstood,” said Hermione sharply.
“Look, the others have told me what you overheard last night on the
Extendable Ears —”
“Yeah?” growled Harry, his hands deep in his pockets as he watched
the snow now falling thickly outside. “All been talking about me, have
you? Well, I’m getting used to it. . . .”
“We wanted to talk to you, Harry,” said Ginny, “but as you’ve been
hiding ever since we got back —”
“I didn’t want anyone to talk to me,” said Harry, who was feeling
more and more nettled.
“Well, that was a bit stupid of you,” said Ginny angrily, “seeing as
you don’t know anyone but me who’s been possessed by You-KnowWho, and I can tell you how it feels.”
Harry remained quite still as the impact of these words hit him.
Then he turned on the spot to face her.

“I forgot,” he said.
“Lucky you,” said Ginny coolly.
“I’m sorry,” Harry said, and he meant it. “So . . . so do you think
I’m being possessed, then?”
“Well, can you remember everything you’ve been doing?” Ginny
asked. “Are there big blank periods where you don’t know what you’ve
been up to?”
Harry racked his brains.
“No,” he said.
“Then You-Know-Who hasn’t ever possessed you,” said Ginny simply. “When he did it to me, I couldn’t remember what I’d been doing
for hours at a time. I’d find myself somewhere and not know how I
got there.”
Harry hardly dared believe her, yet his heart was lightening almost
in spite of himself.
“That dream I had about your dad and the snake, though —”
“Harry, you’ve had these dreams before,” Hermione said. “You had
flashes of what Voldemort was up to last year.”
“This was different,” said Harry, shaking his head. “I was inside
that snake. It was like I was the snake. . . . What if Voldemort somehow transported me to London — ?”
“One day,” said Hermione, sounding thoroughly exasperated,
“you’ll read Hogwarts, A History, and perhaps that will remind you
that you can’t Apparate or Disapparate inside Hogwarts. Even Voldemort couldn’t just make you fly out of your dormitory, Harry.”
“You didn’t leave your bed, mate,” said Ron. “I saw you thrashing
around in your sleep about a minute before we could wake you up. . . .”
Harry started pacing up and down the room again, thinking. What
they were all saying was not only comforting, it made sense. . . .
Without really thinking he took a sandwich from the plate on the bed
and crammed it hungrily into his mouth. . . .
I’m not the weapon after all, thought Harry. His heart swelled with

happiness and relief, and he felt like joining in as they heard Sirius
tramping past their door toward Buckbeak’s room, singing “God Rest
Ye Merry, Hippogriffs” at the top of his voice.
How could he have dreamed of returning to Privet Drive for Christmas? Sirius’s delight at having the house full again, and especially at
having Harry back, was infectious. He was no longer their sullen host
of the summer; now he seemed determined that everyone should enjoy themselves as much, if not more, than they would have done at
Hogwarts, and he worked tirelessly in the run-up to Christmas Day,
cleaning and decorating with their help, so that by the time they all
went to bed on Christmas Eve the house was barely recognizable. The
tarnished chandeliers were no longer hung with cobwebs but with
garlands of holly and gold and silver streamers; magical snow glittered
in heaps over the threadbare carpets; a great Christmas tree, obtained
by Mundungus and decorated with live fairies, blocked Sirius’s family
tree from view; and even the stuffed elf heads on the hall wall wore Father Christmas hats and beards.
Harry awoke on Christmas morning to find a stack of presents at
the foot of his bed and Ron already halfway through opening his own,
rather larger, pile.
“Good haul this year,” he informed Harry through a cloud of paper. “Thanks for the Broom Compass, it’s excellent, beats Hermione’s — she’s got me a homework planner —”
Harry sorted through his presents and found one with Hermione’s
handwriting on it. She had given him too a book that resembled a diary, except that it said things like “Do it today or later you’ll pay!” every
time he opened a page.
Sirius and Lupin had given Harry a set of excellent books entitled
Practical Defensive Magic and Its Use Against the Dark Arts, which had
superb, moving color illustrations of all the counterjinxes and hexes it
described. Harry flicked through the first volume eagerly; he could see

it was going to be highly useful in his plans for the D.A. Hagrid had
sent a furry brown wallet that had fangs, which were presumably supposed to be an antitheft device, but unfortunately prevented Harry
putting any money in without getting his fingers ripped off. Tonks’s
present was a small, working model of a Firebolt, which Harry
watched fly around the room, wishing he still had his full-size version;
Ron had given him an enormous box of Every-Flavor Beans; Mr. and
Mrs. Weasley the usual hand-knitted jumper and some mince pies;
and Dobby, a truly dreadful painting that Harry suspected had been
done by the elf himself. He had just turned it upside down to see
whether it looked better that way when, with a loud crack, Fred and
George Apparated at the foot of his bed.
“Merry Christmas,” said George. “Don’t go downstairs for a bit.”
“Why not?” said Ron.
“Mum’s crying again,” said Fred heavily. “Percy sent back his
Christmas jumper.”
“Without a note,” added George. “Hasn’t asked how Dad is or visited him or anything. . . .”
“We tried to comfort her,” said Fred, moving around the bed to
look at Harry’s portrait. “Told her Percy’s nothing more than a humongous pile of rat droppings —”
“— didn’t work,” said George, helping himself to a Chocolate
Frog. “So Lupin took over. Best let him cheer her up before we go
down for breakfast, I reckon.”
“What’s that supposed to be anyway?” asked Fred, squinting at
Dobby’s painting. “Looks like a gibbon with two black eyes.”
“It’s Harry!” said George, pointing at the back of the picture. “Says
so on the back!”
“Good likeness,” said Fred, grinning. Harry threw his new homework diary at him; it hit the wall opposite and fell to the floor where it
said happily, “If you’ve dotted the i’s and crossed the t’s then you may do
whatever you please!”

They got up and dressed; they could hear various inhabitants of the
house calling “Merry Christmas” to each other. On their way downstairs they met Hermione. “Thanks for the book, Harry!” she said
happily. “I’ve been wanting that New Theory of Numerology for ages!
And that perfume is really unusual, Ron.”
“No problem,” said Ron. “Who’s that for anyway?” he added, nodding at the neatly wrapped present she was carrying.
“Kreacher,” said Hermione brightly.
“It had better not be clothes!” said Ron warningly. “You know what
Sirius said, Kreacher knows too much, we can’t set him free!”
“It isn’t clothes,” said Hermione, “although if I had my way I’d certainly give him something to wear other than that filthy old rag. No,
it’s a patchwork quilt, I thought it would brighten up his bedroom.”
“What bedroom?” said Harry, dropping his voice to a whisper as
they were passing the portrait of Sirius’s mother.
“Well, Sirius says it’s not so much a bedroom, more a kind of —
den,” said Hermione. “Apparently he sleeps under the boiler in that
cupboard off the kitchen.”
Mrs. Weasley was the only person in the basement when they arrived there. She was standing at the stove and sounded as though she
had a bad head cold when she wished them Merry Christmas, and
they all averted their eyes.
“So, this is Kreacher’s bedroom?” said Ron, strolling over to a dingy
door in the corner opposite the pantry which Harry had never seen
open.
“Yes,” said Hermione, now sounding a little nervous. “Er . . . I
think we’d better knock . . .”
Ron rapped the door with his knuckles but there was no reply.
“He must be sneaking around upstairs,” he said, and without further ado pulled open the door. “Urgh.”
Harry peered inside. Most of the cupboard was taken up with a
very large and old-fashioned boiler, but in the foot’s space underneath

the pipes Kreacher had made himself something that looked like a
nest. A jumble of assorted rags and smelly old blankets were piled on
the floor and the small dent in the middle of it showed where
Kreacher curled up to sleep every night. Here and there among the
material were stale bread crusts and moldy old bits of cheese. In a far
corner glinted small objects and coins that Harry guessed Kreacher
had saved, magpielike, from Sirius’s purge of the house, and he had
also managed to retrieve the silver-framed family photographs that
Sirius had thrown away over the summer. Their glass might be shattered, but still the little black-and-white people inside them peered
haughtily up at him, including — he felt a little jolt in his stomach —
the dark, heavy-lidded woman whose trial he had witnessed in Dumbledore’s Pensieve: Bellatrix Lestrange. By the looks of it, hers was
Kreacher’s favorite photograph; he had placed it to the fore of all the
others and had mended the glass clumsily with Spellotape.
“I think I’ll just leave his present here,” said Hermione, laying the
package neatly in the middle of the depression in the rags and blankets
and closing the door quietly. “He’ll find it later, that’ll be fine. . . .”
“Come to think of it,” said Sirius, emerging from the pantry carrying a large turkey as they closed the cupboard door, “has anyone
actually seen Kreacher lately?”
“I haven’t seen him since the night we came back here,” said Harry.
“You were ordering him out of the kitchen.”
“Yeah . . .” said Sirius, frowning. “You know, I think that’s the last
time I saw him, too. . . . He must be hiding upstairs somewhere. . . .”
“He couldn’t have left, could he?” said Harry. “I mean,
