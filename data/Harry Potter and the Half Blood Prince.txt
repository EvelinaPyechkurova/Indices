CHAPTER ONE

THE OTHER MINISTER

I

t was nearing midnight and the Prime Minister was sitting
alone in his office, reading a long memo that was slipping
through his brain without leaving the slightest trace of meaning behind. He was waiting for a call from the President of a far distant
country, and between wondering when the wretched man would
telephone, and trying to suppress unpleasant memories of what had
been a very long, tiring, and difficult week, there was not much
space in his head for anything else. The more he attempted to focus
on the print on the page before him, the more clearly the Prime
Minister could see the gloating face of one of his political opponents. This particular opponent had appeared on the news that very
day, not only to enumerate all the terrible things that had happened
in the last week (as though anyone needed reminding) but also to
explain why each and every one of them was the government’s fault.
The Prime Minister’s pulse quickened at the very thought of
these accusations, for they were neither fair nor true. How on earth




CHAPTER ONE
was his government supposed to have stopped that bridge collapsing? It was outrageous for anybody to suggest that they were not
spending enough on bridges. The bridge was fewer than ten years
old, and the best experts were at a loss to explain why it had
snapped cleanly in two, sending a dozen cars into the watery
depths of the river below. And how dare anyone suggest that it was
lack of policemen that had resulted in those two very nasty and
well-publicized murders? Or that the government should have
somehow foreseen the freak hurricane in the West Country that
had caused so much damage to both people and property? And was
it his fault that one of his Junior Ministers, Herbert Chorley, had
chosen this week to act so peculiarly that he was now going to be
spending a lot more time with his family?
“A grim mood has gripped the country,” the opponent had concluded, barely concealing his own broad grin.
And unfortunately, this was perfectly true. The Prime Minister
felt it himself; people really did seem more miserable than usual.
Even the weather was dismal; all this chilly mist in the middle of
July. . . . It wasn’t right, it wasn’t normal. . . .
He turned over the second page of the memo, saw how much
longer it went on, and gave it up as a bad job. Stretching his arms
above his head he looked around his office mournfully. It was a
handsome room, with a fine marble fireplace facing the long sash
windows, firmly closed against the unseasonable chill. With a slight
shiver, the Prime Minister got up and moved over to the window,
looking out at the thin mist that was pressing itself against the
glass. It was then, as he stood with his back to the room, that he
heard a soft cough behind him.
He froze, nose to nose with his own scared-looking reflection in




THE OTHER MINISTER
the dark glass. He knew that cough. He had heard it before. He
turned very slowly to face the empty room.
“Hello?” he said, trying to sound braver than he felt.
For a brief moment he allowed himself the impossible hope that
nobody would answer him. However, a voice responded at once, a
crisp, decisive voice that sounded as though it were reading a prepared statement. It was coming — as the Prime Minister had
known at the first cough — from the froglike little man wearing a
long silver wig who was depicted in a small, dirty oil painting in the
far corner of the room.
“To the Prime Minister of Muggles. Urgent we meet. Kindly respond immediately. Sincerely, Fudge.”
The man in the painting looked inquiringly at the Prime Minister.
“Er,” said the Prime Minister, “listen. . . . It’s not a very good
time for me. . . . I’m waiting for a telephone call, you see . . . from
the President of —”
“That can be rearranged,” said the portrait at once. The Prime
Minister’s heart sank. He had been afraid of that.
“But I really was rather hoping to speak —”
“We shall arrange for the President to forget to call. He will telephone tomorrow night instead,” said the little man. “Kindly respond immediately to Mr. Fudge.”
“I . . . oh . . . very well,” said the Prime Minister weakly. “Yes,
I’ll see Fudge.”
He hurried back to his desk, straightening his tie as he went. He
had barely resumed his seat, and arranged his face into what he
hoped was a relaxed and unfazed expression, when bright green
flames burst into life in the empty grate beneath his marble mantelpiece. He watched, trying not to betray a flicker of surprise or


CHAPTER ONE
alarm, as a portly man appeared within the flames, spinning as fast
as a top. Seconds later, he had climbed out onto a rather fine antique rug, brushing ash from the sleeves of his long pin-striped
cloak, a lime-green bowler hat in his hand.
“Ah . . . Prime Minister,” said Cornelius Fudge, striding forward
with his hand outstretched. “Good to see you again.”
The Prime Minister could not honestly return this compliment,
so said nothing at all. He was not remotely pleased to see Fudge,
whose occasional appearances, apart from being downright alarming in themselves, generally meant that he was about to hear some
very bad news. Furthermore, Fudge was looking distinctly careworn. He was thinner, balder, and grayer, and his face had a crumpled look. The Prime Minister had seen that kind of look in
politicians before, and it never boded well.
“How can I help you?” he said, shaking Fudge’s hand very briefly
and gesturing toward the hardest of the chairs in front of the desk.
“Difficult to know where to begin,” muttered Fudge, pulling up
the chair, sitting down, and placing his green bowler upon his
knees. “What a week, what a week . . .”
“Had a bad one too, have you?” asked the Prime Minister stiffly,
hoping to convey by this that he had quite enough on his plate already without any extra helpings from Fudge.
“Yes, of course,” said Fudge, rubbing his eyes wearily and looking morosely at the Prime Minister. “I’ve been having the same
week you have, Prime Minister. The Brockdale Bridge . . . the
Bones and Vance murders . . . not to mention the ruckus in the
West Country . . .”
“You — er — your — I mean to say, some of your people
were — were involved in those — those things, were they?”




THE OTHER MINISTER
Fudge fixed the Prime Minister with a rather stern look. “Of
course they were,” he said. “Surely you’ve realized what’s going on?”
“I . . .” hesitated the Prime Minister.
It was precisely this sort of behavior that made him dislike
Fudge’s visits so much. He was, after all, the Prime Minister and
did not appreciate being made to feel like an ignorant schoolboy.
But of course, it had been like this from his very first meeting with
Fudge on his very first evening as Prime Minister. He remembered
it as though it were yesterday and knew it would haunt him until
his dying day.
He had been standing alone in this very office, savoring the triumph that was his after so many years of dreaming and scheming,
when he had heard a cough behind him, just like tonight, and turned
to find that ugly little portrait talking to him, announcing that the
Minister of Magic was about to arrive and introduce himself.
Naturally, he had thought that the long campaign and the strain
of the election had caused him to go mad. He had been utterly terrified to find a portrait talking to him, though this had been nothing to how he felt when a self-proclaimed wizard had bounced out
of the fireplace and shaken his hand. He had remained speechless
throughout Fudge’s kindly explanation that there were witches and
wizards still living in secret all over the world and his reassurances
that he was not to bother his head about them as the Ministry of
Magic took responsibility for the whole Wizarding community and
prevented the non-magical population from getting wind of them.
It was, said Fudge, a difficult job that encompassed everything
from regulations on responsible use of broomsticks to keeping
the dragon population under control (the Prime Minister remembered clutching the desk for support at this point). Fudge had then


5



CHAPTER ONE
patted the shoulder of the still-dumbstruck Prime Minister in a fatherly sort of way.
“Not to worry,” he had said, “it’s odds-on you’ll never see me
again. I’ll only bother you if there’s something really serious going
on our end, something that’s likely to affect the Muggles — the
non-magical population, I should say. Otherwise, it’s live and let
live. And I must say, you’re taking it a lot better than your predecessor. He tried to throw me out the window, thought I was a hoax
planned by the opposition.”
At this, the Prime Minister had found his voice at last.
“You’re — you’re not a hoax, then?”
It had been his last, desperate hope.
“No,” said Fudge gently. “No, I’m afraid I’m not. Look.”
And he had turned the Prime Minister’s teacup into a gerbil.
“But,” said the Prime Minister breathlessly, watching his teacup
chewing on the corner of his next speech, “but why — why has nobody told me — ?”
“The Minister of Magic only reveals him- or herself to the Muggle Prime Minister of the day,” said Fudge, poking his wand back
inside his jacket. “We find it the best way to maintain secrecy.”
“But then,” bleated the Prime Minister, “why hasn’t a former
Prime Minister warned me — ?”
At this, Fudge had actually laughed.
“My dear Prime Minister, are you ever going to tell anybody?”
Still chortling, Fudge had thrown some powder into the fireplace,
stepped into the emerald flames, and vanished with a whooshing
sound. The Prime Minister had stood there, quite motionless, and realized that he would never, as long as he lived, dare mention this encounter to a living soul, for who in the wide world would believe him?


6



THE OTHER MINISTER
The shock had taken a little while to wear off. For a time, he had
tried to convince himself that Fudge had indeed been a hallucination brought on by lack of sleep during his grueling election campaign. In a vain attempt to rid himself of all reminders of this
uncomfortable encounter, he had given the gerbil to his delighted
niece and instructed his private secretary to take down the portrait
of the ugly little man who had announced Fudge’s arrival. To the
Prime Minister’s dismay, however, the portrait had proved impossible to remove. When several carpenters, a builder or two, an art
historian, and the Chancellor of the Exchequer had all tried unsuccessfully to prise it from the wall, the Prime Minister had abandoned the attempt and simply resolved to hope that the thing
remained motionless and silent for the rest of his term in office.
Occasionally he could have sworn he saw out of the corner of his
eye the occupant of the painting yawning, or else scratching his
nose; even, once or twice, simply walking out of his frame and leaving nothing but a stretch of muddy-brown canvas behind. However, he had trained himself not to look at the picture very much,
and always to tell himself firmly that his eyes were playing tricks on
him when anything like this happened.
Then, three years ago, on a night very like tonight, the Prime
Minister had been alone in his office when the portrait had once
again announced the imminent arrival of Fudge, who had burst out
of the fireplace, sopping wet and in a state of considerable panic.
Before the Prime Minister could ask why he was dripping all over
the Axminster, Fudge had started ranting about a prison the Prime
Minister had never heard of, a man named “Serious” Black, something that sounded like “Hogwarts,” and a boy called Harry Potter,
none of which made the remotest sense to the Prime Minister.


CHAPTER ONE
“. . . I’ve just come from Azkaban,” Fudge had panted, tipping
a large amount of water out of the rim of his bowler hat into his
pocket. “Middle of the North Sea, you know, nasty flight . . . the
dementors are in uproar” — he shuddered — “they’ve never had
a breakout before. Anyway, I had to come to you, Prime Minister.
Black’s a known Muggle killer and may be planning to rejoin YouKnow-Who. . . . But of course, you don’t even know who YouKnow-Who is!” He had gazed hopelessly at the Prime Minister for
a moment, then said, “Well, sit down, sit down, I’d better fill you
in. . . . Have a whiskey . . .”
The Prime Minister rather resented being told to sit down in his
own office, let alone offered his own whiskey, but he sat nevertheless. Fudge pulled out his wand, conjured two large glasses full of
amber liquid out of thin air, pushed one of them into the Prime
Minister’s hand, and drew up a chair.
Fudge had talked for more than an hour. At one point, he had
refused to say a certain name aloud and wrote it instead on a piece
of parchment, which he had thrust into the Prime Minister’s
whiskey-free hand. When at last Fudge had stood up to leave, the
Prime Minister had stood up too.
“So you think that . . .” He had squinted down at the name in
his left hand. “Lord Vol —”
“He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named !” snarled Fudge.
“I’m sorry. . . . You think that He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named is
still alive, then?”
“Well, Dumbledore says he is,” said Fudge, as he had fastened
his pin-striped cloak under his chin, “but we’ve never found him.
If you ask me, he’s not dangerous unless he’s got support, so it’s
Black we ought to be worrying about. You’ll put out that warning,


8



THE OTHER MINISTER
then? Excellent. Well, I hope we don’t see each other again, Prime
Minister! Good night.”
But they had seen each other again. Less than a year later a
harassed-looking Fudge had appeared out of thin air in the cabinet
room to inform the Prime Minister that there had been a spot of
bother at the Kwidditch (or that was what it had sounded like)
World Cup and that several Muggles had been “involved,” but that
the Prime Minister was not to worry, the fact that You-KnowWho’s Mark had been seen again meant nothing; Fudge was sure it
was an isolated incident, and the Muggle Liaison Office was dealing with all memory modifications as they spoke.
“Oh, and I almost forgot,” Fudge had added. “We’re importing
three foreign dragons and a sphinx for the Triwizard Tournament,
quite routine, but the Department for the Regulation and Control
of Magical Creatures tells me that it’s down in the rule book that
we have to notify you if we’re bringing highly dangerous creatures
into the country.”
“I — what — dragons?” spluttered the Prime Minister.
“Yes, three,” said Fudge. “And a sphinx. Well, good day to you.”
The Prime Minister had hoped beyond hope that dragons and
sphinxes would be the worst of it, but no. Less than two years later,
Fudge had erupted out of the fire yet again, this time with the news
that there had been a mass breakout from Azkaban.
“A mass breakout?” repeated the Prime Minister hoarsely.
“No need to worry, no need to worry!” shouted Fudge, already
with one foot in the flames. “We’ll have them rounded up in no
time — just thought you ought to know!”
And before the Prime Minister could shout, “Now, wait just one
moment!” Fudge had vanished in a shower of green sparks.




CHAPTER ONE
Whatever the press and the opposition might say, the Prime Minister was not a foolish man. It had not escaped his notice that, despite Fudge’s assurances at their first meeting, they were now seeing
rather a lot of each other, nor that Fudge was becoming more flustered with each visit. Little though he liked to think about the Minister of Magic (or, as he always called Fudge in his head, the Other
Minister), the Prime Minister could not help but fear that the next
time Fudge appeared it would be with graver news still. The sight,
therefore, of Fudge stepping out of the fire once more, looking disheveled and fretful and sternly surprised that the Prime Minister
did not know exactly why he was there, was about the worst thing
that had happened in the course of this extremely gloomy week.
“How should I know what’s going on in the — er — Wizarding
community?” snapped the Prime Minister now. “I have a country
to run and quite enough concerns at the moment without —”
“We have the same concerns,” Fudge interrupted. “The Brockdale Bridge didn’t wear out. That wasn’t really a hurricane. Those
murders were not the work of Muggles. And Herbert Chorley’s
family would be safer without him. We are currently making
arrangements to have him transferred to St. Mungo’s Hospital for
Magical Maladies and Injuries. The move should be effected
tonight.”
“What do you . . . I’m afraid I . . . What?” blustered the Prime
Minister.
Fudge took a great, deep breath and said, “Prime Minister, I am
very sorry to have to tell you that he’s back. He-Who-Must-NotBe-Named is back.”
“Back? When you say ‘back’ . . . he’s alive? I mean —”
The Prime Minister groped in his memory for the details of that


10



THE OTHER MINISTER
horrible conversation of three years previously, when Fudge had
told him about the wizard who was feared above all others, the wizard who had committed a thousand terrible crimes before his mysterious disappearance fifteen years earlier.
“Yes, alive,” said Fudge. “That is — I don’t know — is a man
alive if he can’t be killed? I don’t really understand it, and Dumbledore won’t explain properly — but anyway, he’s certainly got a
body and is walking and talking and killing, so I suppose, for the
purposes of our discussion, yes, he’s alive.”
The Prime Minister did not know what to say to this, but a persistent habit of wishing to appear well-informed on any subject
that came up made him cast around for any details he could remember of their previous conversations.
“Is Serious Black with — er — He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named?”
“Black? Black?” said Fudge distractedly, turning his bowler
rapidly in his fingers. “Sirius Black, you mean? Merlin’s beard, no.
Black’s dead. Turns out we were — er — mistaken about Black.
He was innocent after all. And he wasn’t in league with He-WhoMust-Not-Be-Named either. I mean,” he added defensively, spinning the bowler hat still faster, “all the evidence pointed — we had
more than fifty eyewitnesses — but anyway, as I say, he’s dead.
Murdered, as a matter of fact. On Ministry of Magic premises.
There’s going to be an inquiry, actually. . . .”
To his great surprise, the Prime Minister felt a fleeting stab of
pity for Fudge at this point. It was, however, eclipsed almost immediately by a glow of smugness at the thought that, deficient
though he himself might be in the area of materializing out of fireplaces, there had never been a murder in any of the government departments under his charge. . . . Not yet, anyway . . .


11



CHAPTER ONE
While the Prime Minister surreptitiously touched the wood of
his desk, Fudge continued, “But Black’s by-the-by now. The point
is, we’re at war, Prime Minister, and steps must be taken.”
“At war?” repeated the Prime Minister nervously. “Surely that’s a
little bit of an overstatement?”
“He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named has now been joined by those
of his followers who broke out of Azkaban in January,” said Fudge,
speaking more and more rapidly and twirling his bowler so fast that
it was a lime-green blur. “Since they have moved into the open,
they have been wreaking havoc. The Brockdale Bridge — he did it,
Prime Minister, he threatened a mass Muggle killing unless I stood
aside for him and —”
“Good grief, so it’s your fault those people were killed and I’m
having to answer questions about rusted rigging and corroded expansion joints and I don’t know what else!” said the Prime Minister furiously.
“My fault!” said Fudge, coloring up. “Are you saying you would
have caved in to blackmail like that?”
“Maybe not,” said the Prime Minister, standing up and striding
about the room, “but I would have put all my efforts into catching
the blackmailer before he committed any such atrocity!”
“Do you really think I wasn’t already making every effort?” demanded Fudge heatedly. “Every Auror in the Ministry was — and
is — trying to find him and round up his followers, but we happen
to be talking about one of the most powerful wizards of all time, a
wizard who has eluded capture for almost three decades!”
“So I suppose you’re going to tell me he caused the hurricane in
the West Country too?” said the Prime Minister, his temper rising
with every pace he took. It was infuriating to discover the reason


12



THE OTHER MINISTER
for all these terrible disasters and not to be able to tell the public,
almost worse than it being the government’s fault after all.
“That was no hurricane,” said Fudge miserably.
“Excuse me!” barked the Prime Minister, now positively stamping up and down. “Trees uprooted, roofs ripped off, lampposts
bent, horrible injuries —”
“It was the Death Eaters,” said Fudge. “He-Who-Must-Not-BeNamed’s followers. And . . . and we suspect giant involvement.”
The Prime Minister stopped in his tracks as though he had hit
an invisible wall. “What involvement?”
Fudge grimaced. “He used giants last time, when he wanted to
go for the grand effect,” he said. “The Office of Misinformation
has been working around the clock, we’ve had teams of Obliviators
out trying to modify the memories of all the Muggles who saw
what really happened, we’ve got most of the Department for the
Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures running around
Somerset, but we can’t find the giant — it’s been a disaster.”
“You don’t say!” said the Prime Minister furiously.
“I won’t deny that morale is pretty low at the Ministry,” said
Fudge. “What with all that, and then losing Amelia Bones.”
“Losing who?”
“Amelia Bones. Head of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement. We think He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named may have
murdered her in person, because she was a very gifted witch and —
and all the evidence was that she put up a real fight.”
Fudge cleared his throat and, with an effort, it seemed, stopped
spinning his bowler hat.
“But that murder was in the newspapers,” said the Prime Minister, momentarily diverted from his anger. “Our newspapers. Amelia


13



CHAPTER ONE
Bones . . . it just said she was a middle-aged woman who lived
alone. It was a — a nasty killing, wasn’t it? It’s had rather a lot of
publicity. The police are baffled, you see.”
Fudge sighed. “Well, of course they are,” he said. “Killed in a
room that was locked from the inside, wasn’t she? We, on the other
hand, know exactly who did it, not that that gets us any further toward catching him. And then there was Emmeline Vance, maybe
you didn’t hear about that one —”
“Oh yes I did!” said the Prime Minister. “It happened just
around the corner from here, as a matter of fact. The papers had a
field day with it, ‘breakdown of law and order in the Prime Minister’s backyard —’ ”
“And as if all that wasn’t enough,” said Fudge, barely listening to
the Prime Minister, “we’ve got dementors swarming all over the
place, attacking people left, right, and center. . . .”
Once upon a happier time this sentence would have been unintelligible to the Prime Minister, but he was wiser now.
“I thought dementors guard the prisoners in Azkaban,” he said
cautiously.
“They did,” said Fudge wearily. “But not anymore. They’ve
deserted the prison and joined He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named. I
won’t pretend that wasn’t a blow.”
“But,” said the Prime Minister, with a sense of dawning horror,
“didn’t you tell me they’re the creatures that drain hope and happiness out of people?”
“That’s right. And they’re breeding. That’s what’s causing all this
mist.”
The Prime Minister sank, weak-kneed, into the nearest chair.
The idea of invisible creatures swooping through the towns and


14



THE OTHER MINISTER
countryside, spreading despair and hopelessness in his voters, made
him feel quite faint.
“Now see here, Fudge — you’ve got to do something! It’s your
responsibility as Minister of Magic!”
“My dear Prime Minister, you can’t honestly think I’m still Minister of Magic after all this? I was sacked three days ago! The whole
Wizarding community has been screaming for my resignation for a
fortnight. I’ve never known them so united in my whole term of
office!” said Fudge, with a brave attempt at a smile.
The Prime Minister was momentarily lost for words. Despite his
indignation at the position into which he had been placed, he still
rather felt for the shrunken-looking man sitting opposite him.
“I’m very sorry,” he said finally. “If there’s anything I can do?”
“It’s very kind of you, Prime Minister, but there is nothing. I was
sent here tonight to bring you up to date on recent events and to introduce you to my successor. I rather thought he’d be here by now,
but of course, he’s very busy at the moment, with so much going on.”
Fudge looked around at the portrait of the ugly little man wearing the long curly silver wig, who was digging in his ear with the
point of a quill. Catching Fudge’s eye, the portrait said, “He’ll be
here in a moment, he’s just finishing a letter to Dumbledore.”
“I wish him luck,” said Fudge, sounding bitter for the first time.
“I’ve been writing to Dumbledore twice a day for the past fortnight,
but he won’t budge. If he’d just been prepared to persuade the boy,
I might still be . . . Well, maybe Scrimgeour will have more success.”
Fudge subsided into what was clearly an aggrieved silence, but it
was broken almost immediately by the portrait, which suddenly
spoke in its crisp, official voice.
“To the Prime Minister of Muggles. Requesting a meeting.


15



CHAPTER ONE
Urgent. Kindly respond immediately. Rufus Scrimgeour, Minister
of Magic.”
“Yes, yes, fine,” said the Prime Minister distractedly, and he
barely flinched as the flames in the grate turned emerald green
again, rose up, and revealed a second spinning wizard in their
heart, disgorging him moments later onto the antique rug.
Fudge got to his feet and, after a moment’s hesitation, the Prime
Minister did the same, watching the new arrival straighten up, dust
down his long black robes, and look around.
The Prime Minister’s first, foolish thought was that Rufus
Scrimgeour looked rather like an old lion. There were streaks of
gray in his mane of tawny hair and his bushy eyebrows; he had
keen yellowish eyes behind a pair of wire-rimmed spectacles and a
certain rangy, loping grace even though he walked with a slight
limp. There was an immediate impression of shrewdness and
toughness; the Prime Minister thought he understood why the
Wizarding community preferred Scrimgeour to Fudge as a leader
in these dangerous times.
“How do you do?” said the Prime Minister politely, holding out
his hand.
Scrimgeour grasped it briefly, his eyes scanning the room, then
pulled out a wand from under his robes.
“Fudge told you everything?” he asked, striding over to the door
and tapping the keyhole with his wand. The Prime Minister heard
the lock click.
“Er — yes,” said the Prime Minister. “And if you don’t mind, I’d
rather that door remained unlocked.”
“I’d rather not be interrupted,” said Scrimgeour shortly, “or
watched,” he added, pointing his wand at the windows, so that the


16



THE OTHER MINISTER
curtains swept across them. “Right, well, I’m a busy man, so let’s
get down to business. First of all, we need to discuss your security.”
The Prime Minister drew himself up to his fullest height and
replied, “I am perfectly happy with the security I’ve already got,
thank you very —”
“Well, we’re not,” Scrimgeour cut in. “It’ll be a poor lookout for
the Muggles if their Prime Minister gets put under the Imperius
Curse. The new secretary in your outer office —”
“I’m not getting rid of Kingsley Shacklebolt, if that’s what you’re
suggesting!” said the Prime Minister hotly. “He’s highly efficient,
gets through twice the work the rest of them —”
“That’s because he’s a wizard,” said Scrimgeour, without a flicker
of a smile. “A highly trained Auror, who has been assigned to you
for your protection.”
“Now, wait a moment!” declared the Prime Minister. “You can’t
just put your people into my office, I decide who works for me —”
“I thought you were happy with Shacklebolt?” said Scrimgeour
coldly.
“I am — that’s to say, I was —”
“Then there’s no problem, is there?” said Scrimgeour.
“I . . . well, as long as Shacklebolt’s work continues to be . . . er
. . . excellent,” said the Prime Minister lamely, but Scrimgeour
barely seemed to hear him.
“Now, about Herbert Chorley, your Junior Minister,” he continued. “The one who has been entertaining the public by impersonating a duck.”
“What about him?” asked the Prime Minister.
“He has clearly reacted to a poorly performed Imperius Curse,” said
Scrimgeour. “It’s addled his brains, but he could still be dangerous.”

CHAPTER ONE
“He’s only quacking!” said the Prime Minister weakly. “Surely a
bit of a rest . . . Maybe go easy on the drink . . .”
“A team of Healers from St. Mungo’s Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries are examining him as we speak. So far he has attempted to strangle three of them,” said Scrimgeour. “I think it
best that we remove him from Muggle society for a while.”
“I . . . well . . . He’ll be all right, won’t he?” said the Prime Minister anxiously.
Scrimgeour merely shrugged, already moving back toward the
fireplace.
“Well, that’s really all I had to say. I will keep you posted of developments, Prime Minister — or, at least, I shall probably be too
busy to come personally, in which case I shall send Fudge here. He
has consented to stay on in an advisory capacity.”
Fudge attempted to smile, but was unsuccessful; he merely
looked as though he had a toothache. Scrimgeour was already rummaging in his pocket for the mysterious powder that turned the fire
green. The Prime Minister gazed hopelessly at the pair of them for
a moment, then the words he had fought to suppress all evening
burst from him at last.
“But for heaven’s sake — you’re wizards! You can do magic !
Surely you can sort out — well — anything!”
Scrimgeour turned slowly on the spot and exchanged an incredulous look with Fudge, who really did manage a smile this time as
he said kindly, “The trouble is, the other side can do magic too,
Prime Minister.”
And with that, the two wizards stepped one after the other into
the bright green fire and vanished.

any miles away the chilly mist that had pressed against
the Prime Minister’s windows drifted over a dirty
river that wound between overgrown, rubbish-strewn banks. An
immense chimney, relic of a disused mill, reared up, shadowy and
ominous. There was no sound apart from the whisper of the black
water and no sign of life apart from a scrawny fox that had slunk
down the bank to nose hopefully at some old fish-and-chip wrappings in the tall grass.
But then, with a very faint pop, a slim, hooded figure appeared
out of thin air on the edge of the river. The fox froze, wary eyes
fixed upon this strange new phenomenon. The figure seemed to
take its bearings for a few moments, then set off with light, quick
strides, its long cloak rustling over the grass.
With a second and louder pop, another hooded figure materialized.
“Wait!”


CHAPTER TWO
The harsh cry startled the fox, now crouching almost flat in the
undergrowth. It leapt from its hiding place and up the bank. There
was a flash of green light, a yelp, and the fox fell back to the
ground, dead.
The second figure turned over the animal with its toe.
“Just a fox,” said a woman’s voice dismissively from under the
hood. “I thought perhaps an Auror — Cissy, wait!”
But her quarry, who had paused and looked back at the flash of
light, was already scrambling up the bank the fox had just fallen
down.
“Cissy — Narcissa — listen to me —”
The second woman caught the first and seized her arm, but the
other wrenched it away.
“Go back, Bella!”
“You must listen to me!”
“I’ve listened already. I’ve made my decision. Leave me alone!”
The woman named Narcissa gained the top of the bank, where
a line of old railings separated the river from a narrow, cobbled
street. The other woman, Bella, followed at once. Side by side they
stood looking across the road at the rows and rows of dilapidated
brick houses, their windows dull and blind in the darkness.
“He lives here?” asked Bella in a voice of contempt. “Here? In
this Muggle dunghill? We must be the first of our kind ever to set
foot —”
But Narcissa was not listening; she had slipped through a gap in
the rusty railings and was already hurrying across the road.
“Cissy, wait!”
Bella followed, her cloak streaming behind, and saw Narcissa
darting through an alley between the houses into a second, almost

identical street. Some of the streetlamps were broken; the two
women were running between patches of light and deep darkness.
The pursuer caught up with her prey just as she turned another
corner, this time succeeding in catching hold of her arm and swinging her around so that they faced each other.
“Cissy, you must not do this, you can’t trust him —”
“The Dark Lord trusts him, doesn’t he?”
“The Dark Lord is . . . I believe . . . mistaken,” Bella panted,
and her eyes gleamed momentarily under her hood as she looked
around to check that they were indeed alone. “In any case, we were
told not to speak of the plan to anyone. This is a betrayal of the
Dark Lord’s —”
“Let go, Bella!” snarled Narcissa, and she drew a wand from beneath her cloak, holding it threateningly in the other’s face. Bella
merely laughed.
“Cissy, your own sister? You wouldn’t —”
“There is nothing I wouldn’t do anymore!” Narcissa breathed, a
note of hysteria in her voice, and as she brought down the wand
like a knife, there was another flash of light. Bella let go of her sister’s arm as though burned.
“Narcissa!”
But Narcissa had rushed ahead. Rubbing her hand, her pursuer
followed again, keeping her distance now, as they moved deeper
into the deserted labyrinth of brick houses. At last, Narcissa hurried up a street named Spinner’s End, over which the towering mill
chimney seemed to hover like a giant admonitory finger. Her footsteps echoed on the cobbles as she passed boarded and broken windows, until she reached the very last house, where a dim light
glimmered through the curtains in a downstairs room.

CHAPTER TWO
She had knocked on the door before Bella, cursing under her
breath, had caught up. Together they stood waiting, panting
slightly, breathing in the smell of the dirty river that was carried to
them on the night breeze. After a few seconds, they heard movement behind the door and it opened a crack. A sliver of a man
could be seen looking out at them, a man with long black hair
parted in curtains around a sallow face and black eyes.
Narcissa threw back her hood. She was so pale that she seemed
to shine in the darkness; the long blonde hair streaming down her
back gave her the look of a drowned person.
“Narcissa!” said the man, opening the door a little wider, so that
the light fell upon her and her sister too. “What a pleasant surprise!
“Severus,” she said in a strained whisper. “May I speak to you?
It’s urgent.”
“But of course.”
He stood back to allow her to pass him into the house. Her stillhooded sister followed without invitation.
“Snape,” she said curtly as she passed him.
“Bellatrix,” he replied, his thin mouth curling into a slightly
mocking smile as he closed the door with a snap behind them.
They had stepped directly into a tiny sitting room, which had
the feeling of a dark, padded cell. The walls were completely covered in books, most of them bound in old black or brown leather;
a threadbare sofa, an old armchair, and a rickety table stood
grouped together in a pool of dim light cast by a candle-filled lamp
hung from the ceiling. The place had an air of neglect, as though it
was not usually inhabited.
Snape gestured Narcissa to the sofa. She threw off her cloak, cast

SPINNER’S END
it aside, and sat down, staring at her white and trembling hands
clasped in her lap. Bellatrix lowered her hood more slowly. Dark as
her sister was fair, with heavily lidded eyes and a strong jaw, she did
not take her gaze from Snape as she moved to stand behind
Narcissa.
“So, what can I do for you?” Snape asked, settling himself in the
armchair opposite the two sisters.
“We . . . we are alone, aren’t we?” Narcissa asked quietly.
“Yes, of course. Well, Wormtail’s here, but we’re not counting
vermin, are we?”
He pointed his wand at the wall of books behind him and with
a bang, a hidden door flew open, revealing a narrow staircase upon
which a small man stood frozen.
“As you have clearly realized, Wormtail, we have guests,” said
Snape lazily.
The man crept, hunchbacked, down the last few steps and
moved into the room. He had small, watery eyes, a pointed nose,
and wore an unpleasant simper. His left hand was caressing his
right, which looked as though it was encased in a bright silver
glove.
“Narcissa!” he said, in a squeaky voice. “And Bellatrix! How
charming —”
“Wormtail will get us drinks, if you’d like them,” said Snape.
“And then he will return to his bedroom.”
Wormtail winced as though Snape had thrown something at
him.
“I am not your servant!” he squeaked, avoiding Snape’s eye.
“Really? I was under the impression that the Dark Lord placed
you here to assist me.”


23

CHAPTER TWO
“To assist, yes — but not to make you drinks and — and clean
your house!”
“I had no idea, Wormtail, that you were craving more dangerous
assignments,” said Snape silkily. “This can be easily arranged: I
shall speak to the Dark Lord —”
“I can speak to him myself if I want to!”
“Of course you can,” said Snape, sneering. “But in the meantime, bring us drinks. Some of the elf-made wine will do.”
Wormtail hesitated for a moment, looking as though he might
argue, but then turned and headed through a second hidden door.
They heard banging and a clinking of glasses. Within seconds he
was back, bearing a dusty bottle and three glasses upon a tray. He
dropped these on the rickety table and scurried from their presence, slamming the book-covered door behind him.
Snape poured out three glasses of bloodred wine and handed
two of them to the sisters. Narcissa murmured a word of thanks,
whilst Bellatrix said nothing, but continued to glower at Snape.
This did not seem to discompose him; on the contrary, he looked
rather amused.
“The Dark Lord,” he said, raising his glass and draining it.
The sisters copied him. Snape refilled their glasses. As Narcissa
took her second drink she said in a rush, “Severus, I’m sorry to
come here like this, but I had to see you. I think you are the only
one who can help me —”
Snape held up a hand to stop her, then pointed his wand again
at the concealed staircase door. There was a loud bang and a squeal,
followed by the sound of Wormtail scurrying back up the stairs.
“My apologies,” said Snape. “He has lately taken to listening at

doors, I don’t know what he means by it. . . . You were saying,
Narcissa?”
She took a great, shuddering breath and started again.
“Severus, I know I ought not to be here, I have been told to say
nothing to anyone, but —”
“Then you ought to hold your tongue!” snarled Bellatrix. “Particularly in present company!”
“ ‘Present company’?” repeated Snape sardonically. “And what
am I to understand by that, Bellatrix?”
“That I don’t trust you, Snape, as you very well know!”
Narcissa let out a noise that might have been a dry sob and covered her face with her hands. Snape set his glass down upon the
table and sat back again, his hands upon the arms of his chair, smiling into Bellatrix’s glowering face.
“Narcissa, I think we ought to hear what Bellatrix is bursting to
say; it will save tedious interruptions. Well, continue, Bellatrix,”
said Snape. “Why is it that you do not trust me?”
“A hundred reasons!” she said loudly, striding out from behind
the sofa to slam her glass upon the table. “Where to start! Where
were you when the Dark Lord fell? Why did you never make any
attempt to find him when he vanished? What have you been doing
all these years that you’ve lived in Dumbledore’s pocket? Why did
you stop the Dark Lord procuring the Sorcerer’s Stone? Why
did you not return at once when the Dark Lord was reborn? Where
were you a few weeks ago when we battled to retrieve the prophecy
for the Dark Lord? And why, Snape, is Harry Potter still alive,
when you have had him at your mercy for five years?”
She paused, her chest rising and falling rapidly, the color high in



CHAPTER TWO
her cheeks. Behind her, Narcissa sat motionless, her face still hidden in her hands.
Snape smiled.
“Before I answer you — oh yes, Bellatrix, I am going to answer!
You can carry my words back to the others who whisper behind my
back, and carry false tales of my treachery to the Dark Lord! Before
I answer you, I say, let me ask a question in turn. Do you really
think that the Dark Lord has not asked me each and every one of
those questions? And do you really think that, had I not been able
to give satisfactory answers, I would be sitting here talking to you?”
She hesitated.
“I know he believes you, but . . .”
“You think he is mistaken? Or that I have somehow hoodwinked
him? Fooled the Dark Lord, the greatest wizard, the most accomplished Legilimens the world has ever seen?”
Bellatrix said nothing, but looked, for the first time, a little discomfited. Snape did not press the point. He picked up his drink
again, sipped it, and continued, “You ask where I was when the
Dark Lord fell. I was where he had ordered me to be, at Hogwarts
School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, because he wished me to spy
upon Albus Dumbledore. You know, I presume, that it was on the
Dark Lord’s orders that I took up the post?”
She nodded almost imperceptibly and then opened her mouth,
but Snape forestalled her.
“You ask why I did not attempt to find him when he vanished.
For the same reason that Avery, Yaxley, the Carrows, Greyback, Lucius” — he inclined his head slightly to Narcissa — “and many
others did not attempt to find him. I believed him finished. I am
not proud of it, I was wrong, but there it is. . . . If he had not

forgiven we who lost faith at that time, he would have very few followers left.”
“He’d have me!” said Bellatrix passionately. “I, who spent many
years in Azkaban for him!”
“Yes, indeed, most admirable,” said Snape in a bored voice. “Of
course, you weren’t a lot of use to him in prison, but the gesture
was undoubtedly fine —”
“Gesture!” she shrieked; in her fury she looked slightly mad.
“While I endured the dementors, you remained at Hogwarts, comfortably playing Dumbledore’s pet!”
“Not quite,” said Snape calmly. “He wouldn’t give me the Defense Against the Dark Arts job, you know. Seemed to think it
might, ah, bring about a relapse . . . tempt me into my old ways.”
“This was your sacrifice for the Dark Lord, not to teach your favorite subject?” she jeered. “Why did you stay there all that time,
Snape? Still spying on Dumbledore for a master you believed
dead?”
“Hardly,” said Snape, “although the Dark Lord is pleased that I
never deserted my post: I had sixteen years of information on
Dumbledore to give him when he returned, a rather more useful
welcome-back present than endless reminiscences of how unpleasant Azkaban is. . . .”
“But you stayed —”
“Yes, Bellatrix, I stayed,” said Snape, betraying a hint of impatience for the first time. “I had a comfortable job that I preferred to
a stint in Azkaban. They were rounding up the Death Eaters, you
know. Dumbledore’s protection kept me out of jail; it was most
convenient and I used it. I repeat: The Dark Lord does not complain that I stayed, so I do not see why you do.


27

CHAPTER TWO
“I think you next wanted to know,” he pressed on, a little more
loudly, for Bellatrix showed every sign of interrupting, “why I
stood between the Dark Lord and the Sorcerer’s Stone. That is easily answered. He did not know whether he could trust me. He
thought, like you, that I had turned from faithful Death Eater to
Dumbledore’s stooge. He was in a pitiable condition, very weak,
sharing the body of a mediocre wizard. He did not dare reveal himself to a former ally if that ally might turn him over to Dumbledore
or the Ministry. I deeply regret that he did not trust me. He would
have returned to power three years sooner. As it was, I saw only
greedy and unworthy Quirrell attempting to steal the stone and, I
admit, I did all I could to thwart him.”
Bellatrix’s mouth twisted as though she had taken an unpleasant
dose of medicine.
“But you didn’t return when he came back, you didn’t fly back to
him at once when you felt the Dark Mark burn —”
“Correct. I returned two hours later. I returned on Dumbledore’s orders.”
“On Dumbledore’s — ?” she began, in tones of outrage.
“Think!” said Snape, impatient again. “Think! By waiting two
hours, just two hours, I ensured that I could remain at Hogwarts as a
spy! By allowing Dumbledore to think that I was only returning
to the Dark Lord’s side because I was ordered to, I have been able
to pass information on Dumbledore and the Order of the Phoenix
ever since! Consider, Bellatrix: The Dark Mark had been growing
stronger for months. I knew he must be about to return, all the Death
Eaters knew! I had plenty of time to think about what I wanted to
do, to plan my next move, to escape like Karkaroff, didn’t I?
“The Dark Lord’s initial displeasure at my lateness vanished

entirely, I assure you, when I explained that I remained faithful, although Dumbledore thought I was his man. Yes, the Dark Lord
thought that I had left him forever, but he was wrong.”
“But what use have you been?” sneered Bellatrix. “What useful
information have we had from you?”
“My information has been conveyed directly to the Dark Lord,”
said Snape. “If he chooses not to share it with you —”
“He shares everything with me!” said Bellatrix, firing up at once.
“He calls me his most loyal, his most faithful —”
“Does he?” said Snape, his voice delicately inflected to suggest
his disbelief. “Does he still, after the fiasco at the Ministry?”
“That was not my fault!” said Bellatrix, flushing. “The Dark
Lord has, in the past, entrusted me with his most precious — if
Lucius hadn’t —”
“Don’t you dare — don’t you dare blame my husband!” said
Narcissa, in a low and deadly voice, looking up at her sister.
“There is no point apportioning blame,” said Snape smoothly.
“What is done, is done.”
“But not by you!” said Bellatrix furiously. “No, you were once
again absent while the rest of us ran dangers, were you not, Snape?”
“My orders were to remain behind,” said Snape. “Perhaps you
disagree with the Dark Lord, perhaps you think that Dumbledore
would not have noticed if I had joined forces with the Death Eaters
to fight the Order of the Phoenix? And — forgive me — you speak
of dangers . . . you were facing six teenagers, were you not?”
“They were joined, as you very well know, by half of the Order
before long!” snarled Bellatrix. “And, while we are on the subject of
the Order, you still claim you cannot reveal the whereabouts
of their headquarters, don’t you?”


CHAPTER TWO
“I am not the Secret-Keeper; I cannot speak the name of the
place. You understand how the enchantment works, I think? The
Dark Lord is satisfied with the information I have passed him on
the Order. It led, as perhaps you have guessed, to the recent capture
and murder of Emmeline Vance, and it certainly helped dispose of
Sirius Black, though I give you full credit for finishing him off.”
He inclined his head and toasted her. Her expression did not
soften.
“You are avoiding my last question, Snape. Harry Potter. You
could have killed him at any point in the past five years. You have
not done it. Why?”
“Have you discussed this matter with the Dark Lord?” asked
Snape.
“He . . . lately, we . . . I am asking you, Snape!”
“If I had murdered Harry Potter, the Dark Lord could not have
used his blood to regenerate, making him invincible —”
“You claim you foresaw his use of the boy!” she jeered.
“I do not claim it; I had no idea of his plans; I have already confessed that I thought the Dark Lord dead. I am merely trying to explain why the Dark Lord is not sorry that Potter survived, at least
until a year ago. . . .”
“But why did you keep him alive?”
“Have you not understood me? It was only Dumbledore’s protection that was keeping me out of Azkaban! Do you disagree that
murdering his favorite student might have turned him against me?
But there was more to it than that. I should remind you that when
Potter first arrived at Hogwarts there were still many stories circulating about him, rumors that he himself was a great Dark wizard,
which was how he had survived the Dark Lord’s attack. Indeed,


30



SPINNER’S END
many of the Dark Lord’s old followers thought Potter might be a
standard around which we could all rally once more. I was curious,
I admit it, and not at all inclined to murder him the moment he set
foot in the castle.
“Of course, it became apparent to me very quickly that he had
no extraordinary talent at all. He has fought his way out of a number of tight corners by a simple combination of sheer luck and
more talented friends. He is mediocre to the last degree, though as
obnoxious and self-satisfied as was his father before him. I have
done my utmost to have him thrown out of Hogwarts, where I believe he scarcely belongs, but kill him, or allow him to be killed in
front of me? I would have been a fool to risk it with Dumbledore
close at hand.”
“And through all this we are supposed to believe Dumbledore
has never suspected you?” asked Bellatrix. “He has no idea of your
true allegiance, he trusts you implicitly still?”
“I have played my part well,” said Snape. “And you overlook
Dumbledore’s greatest weakness: He has to believe the best of people. I spun him a tale of deepest remorse when I joined his staff,
fresh from my Death Eater days, and he embraced me with open
arms — though, as I say, never allowing me nearer the Dark Arts
than he could help. Dumbledore has been a great wizard — oh yes,
he has,” (for Bellatrix had made a scathing noise), “the Dark Lord
acknowledges it. I am pleased to say, however, that Dumbledore is
growing old. The duel with the Dark Lord last month shook him.
He has since sustained a serious injury because his reactions are
slower than they once were. But through all these years, he has
never stopped trusting Severus Snape, and therein lies my great
value to the Dark Lord.”


CHAPTER TWO
Bellatrix still looked unhappy, though she appeared unsure how
best to attack Snape next. Taking advantage of her silence, Snape
turned to her sister.
“Now . . . you came to ask me for help, Narcissa?”
Narcissa looked up at him, her face eloquent with despair.
“Yes, Severus. I — I think you are the only one who can help
me, I have nowhere else to turn. Lucius is in jail and . . .”
She closed her eyes and two large tears seeped from beneath her
eyelids.
“The Dark Lord has forbidden me to speak of it,” Narcissa continued, her eyes still closed. “He wishes none to know of the plan.
It is . . . very secret. But —”
“If he has forbidden it, you ought not to speak,” said Snape at
once. “The Dark Lord’s word is law.”
Narcissa gasped as though he had doused her with cold water.
Bellatrix looked satisfied for the first time since she had entered the
house.
“There!” she said triumphantly to her sister. “Even Snape says
so: You were told not to talk, so hold your silence!”
But Snape had gotten to his feet and strode to the small window,
peered through the curtains at the deserted street, then closed them
again with a jerk. He turned around to face Narcissa, frowning.
“It so happens that I know of the plan,” he said in a low voice.
“I am one of the few the Dark Lord has told. Nevertheless, had I
not been in on the secret, Narcissa, you would have been guilty of
great treachery to the Dark Lord.”
“I thought you must know about it!” said Narcissa, breathing
more freely. “He trusts you so, Severus. . . .”

SPINNER’S END
“You know about the plan?” said Bellatrix, her fleeting expression of satisfaction replaced by a look of outrage. “You know?”
“Certainly,” said Snape. “But what help do you require, Narcissa? If you are imagining I can persuade the Dark Lord to change
his mind, I am afraid there is no hope, none at all.”
“Severus,” she whispered, tears sliding down her pale cheeks.
“My son . . . my only son . . .”
“Draco should be proud,” said Bellatrix indifferently. “The Dark
Lord is granting him a great honor. And I will say this for Draco:
He isn’t shrinking away from his duty, he seems glad of a chance to
prove himself, excited at the prospect —”
Narcissa began to cry in earnest, gazing beseechingly all the
while at Snape.
“That’s because he is sixteen and has no idea what lies in store!
Why, Severus? Why my son? It is too dangerous! This is vengeance
for Lucius’s mistake, I know it!”
Snape said nothing. He looked away from the sight of her tears
as though they were indecent, but he could not pretend not to hear
her.
“That’s why he’s chosen Draco, isn’t it?” she persisted. “To punish Lucius?”
“If Draco succeeds,” said Snape, still looking away from her, “he
will be honored above all others.”
“But he won’t succeed!” sobbed Narcissa. “How can he, when
the Dark Lord himself — ?”
Bellatrix gasped; Narcissa seemed to lose her nerve.
“I only meant . . . that nobody has yet succeeded. . . . Severus
. . . please . . . You are, you have always been, Draco’s favorite

teacher. . . . You are Lucius’s old friend. . . . I beg you. . . . You are
the Dark Lord’s favorite, his most trusted advisor. . . . Will you
speak to him, persuade him — ?”
“The Dark Lord will not be persuaded, and I am not stupid
enough to attempt it,” said Snape flatly. “I cannot pretend that the
Dark Lord is not angry with Lucius. Lucius was supposed to be in
charge. He got himself captured, along with how many others, and
failed to retrieve the prophecy into the bargain. Yes, the Dark Lord
is angry, Narcissa, very angry indeed.”
“Then I am right, he has chosen Draco in revenge!” choked
Narcissa. “He does not mean him to succeed, he wants him to be
killed trying!”
When Snape said nothing, Narcissa seemed to lose what little
self-restraint she still possessed. Standing up, she staggered to Snape
and seized the front of his robes. Her face close to his, her tears
falling onto his chest, she gasped, “You could do it. You could do it
instead of Draco, Severus. You would succeed, of course you would,
and he would reward you beyond all of us —”
Snape caught hold of her wrists and removed her clutching
hands. Looking down into her tearstained face, he said slowly, “He
intends me to do it in the end, I think. But he is determined that
Draco should try first. You see, in the unlikely event that Draco
succeeds, I shall be able to remain at Hogwarts a little longer, fulfilling my useful role as spy.”
“In other words, it doesn’t matter to him if Draco is killed!”
“The Dark Lord is very angry,” repeated Snape quietly. “He
failed to hear the prophecy. You know as well as I do, Narcissa, that
he does not forgive easily.”

She crumpled, falling at his feet, sobbing and moaning on the
floor.
“My only son . . . my only son . . .”
“You should be proud!” said Bellatrix ruthlessly. “If I had sons, I
would be glad to give them up to the service of the Dark Lord!”
Narcissa gave a little scream of despair and clutched at her long
blonde hair. Snape stooped, seized her by the arms, lifted her up,
and steered her back onto the sofa. He then poured her more wine
and forced the glass into her hand.
“Narcissa, that’s enough. Drink this. Listen to me.”
She quieted a little; slopping wine down herself, she took a shaky
sip.
“It might be possible . . . for me to help Draco.”
She sat up, her face paper-white, her eyes huge.
“Severus — oh, Severus — you would help him? Would you
look after him, see he comes to no harm?”
“I can try.”
She flung away her glass; it skidded across the table as she slid off
the sofa into a kneeling position at Snape’s feet, seized his hand in
both of hers, and pressed her lips to it.
“If you are there to protect him . . . Severus, will you swear it?
Will you make the Unbreakable Vow?”
“The Unbreakable Vow?”
Snape’s expression was blank, unreadable. Bellatrix, however, let
out a cackle of triumphant laughter.
“Aren’t you listening, Narcissa? Oh, he’ll try, I’m sure. . . . The
usual empty words, the usual slithering out of action . . . oh, on the
Dark Lord’s orders, of course!”

Snape did not look at Bellatrix. His black eyes were fixed upon
Narcissa’s tear-filled blue ones as she continued to clutch his hand.
“Certainly, Narcissa, I shall make the Unbreakable Vow,” he said
quietly. “Perhaps your sister will consent to be our Bonder.”
Bellatrix’s mouth fell open. Snape lowered himself so that he was
kneeling opposite Narcissa. Beneath Bellatrix’s astonished gaze, they
grasped right hands.
“You will need your wand, Bellatrix,” said Snape coldly.
She drew it, still looking astonished.
“And you will need to move a little closer,” he said.
She stepped forward so that she stood over them, and placed the
tip of her wand on their linked hands.
Narcissa spoke.
“Will you, Severus, watch over my son, Draco, as he attempts to
fulfill the Dark Lord’s wishes?”
“I will,” said Snape.
A thin tongue of brilliant flame issued from the wand and
wound its way around their hands like a red-hot wire.
“And will you, to the best of your ability, protect him from
harm?”
“I will,” said Snape.
A second tongue of flame shot from the wand and interlinked
with the first, making a fine, glowing chain.
“And, should it prove necessary . . . if it seems Draco will
fail . . .” whispered Narcissa (Snape’s hand twitched within hers,
but he did not draw away), “will you carry out the deed that the
Dark Lord has ordered Draco to perform?”
There was a moment’s silence. Bellatrix watched, her wand upon
their clasped hands, her eyes wide.

“I will,” said Snape.
Bellatrix’s astounded face glowed red in the blaze of a third
tongue of flame, which shot from the wand, twisted with the others, and bound itself thickly around their clasped hands, like a
rope, like a fiery snake.

arry Potter was snoring loudly. He had been sitting in a
chair beside his bedroom window for the best part of
four hours, staring out at the darkening street, and had finally
fallen asleep with one side of his face pressed against the cold windowpane, his glasses askew and his mouth wide open. The misty
fug his breath had left on the window sparkled in the orange glare
of the streetlamp outside, and the artificial light drained his face of
all color, so that he looked ghostly beneath his shock of untidy
black hair.
The room was strewn with various possessions and a good
smattering of rubbish. Owl feathers, apple cores, and sweet
wrappers littered the floor, a number of spellbooks lay higgledypiggledy among the tangled robes on his bed, and a mess of
newspapers sat in a puddle of light on his desk. The headline
of one blared:

WILL AND WON’T
HARRY POTTER: THE CHOSEN ONE?

Rumors continue to fly about the mysterious recent disturbance at the Ministry of Magic, during
which He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named was sighted
once more.
“We’re not allowed to talk about it, don’t ask me
anything,” said one agitated Obliviator, who refused to give his name as he left the Ministry last
night.
Nevertheless, highly placed sources within the
Ministry have confirmed that the disturbance centered on the fabled Hall of Prophecy.
Though Ministry spokeswizards have hitherto
refused even to confirm the existence of such a
place, a growing number of the Wizarding community believe that the Death Eaters now serving sentences in Azkaban for trespass and attempted theft
were attempting to steal a prophecy. The nature of
that prophecy is unknown, although speculation is
rife that it concerns Harry Potter, the only person
ever known to have survived the Killing Curse, and
who is also known to have been at the Ministry on
the night in question. Some are going so far as to
call Potter “the Chosen One,” believing that the
prophecy names him as the only one who will be
able to rid us of He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named.
The current whereabouts of the prophecy, if it
exists, are unknown, although (ctd. page 2, column 5)

A second newspaper lay beside the first. This one bore the
headline:

SCRIMGEOUR SUCCEEDS FUDGE
Most of this front page was taken up with a large black-andwhite picture of a man with a lionlike mane of thick hair and a
rather ravaged face. The picture was moving — the man was waving at the ceiling.
Rufus Scrimgeour, previously Head of the Auror
office in the Department of Magical Law Enforcement, has succeeded Cornelius Fudge as Minister of
Magic. The appointment has largely been greeted
with enthusiasm by the Wizarding community,
though rumors of a rift between the new Minister
and Albus Dumbledore, newly reinstated Chief
Warlock of the Wizengamot, surfaced within hours
of Scrimgeour taking office.
Scrimgeour’s representatives admitted that he
had met with Dumbledore at once upon taking
possession of the top job, but refused to comment on the topics under discussion. Albus Dumbledore is known to (ctd. page 3, column 2)

Newly appointed Minister of Magic, Rufus Scrimgeour, spoke today of the tough new measures
taken by his Ministry to ensure the safety of students returning to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft
and Wizardry this autumn.
“For obvious reasons, the Ministry will not be
going into detail about its stringent new security
plans,” said the Minister, although an insider confirmed that measures include defensive spells and
charms, a complex array of countercurses, and a
small task force of Aurors dedicated solely to the
protection of Hogwarts School.
Most seem reassured by the new Minister’s
tough stand on student safety. Said Mrs. Augusta
Longbottom, “My grandson, Neville — a good
friend of Harry Potter’s, incidentally, who fought
the Death Eaters alongside him at the Ministry in
June and —
But the rest of this story was obscured by the large birdcage
standing on top of it. Inside it was a magnificent snowy owl. Her
amber eyes surveyed the room imperiously, her head swiveling
occasionally to gaze at her snoring master. Once or twice she
clicked her beak impatiently, but Harry was too deeply asleep to
hear her.
A large trunk stood in the very middle of the room. Its lid was
open; it looked expectant; yet it was almost empty but for a residue
of old underwear, sweets, empty ink bottles, and broken quills that

coated the very bottom. Nearby, on the floor, lay a purple leaflet
emblazoned with the words:

The Ministry of Magic
PROTECTING YOUR HOME AND FAMILY
AGAINST DARK FORCES
The Wizarding community is currently under threat from an organization calling itself the Death Eaters. Observing the following
simple security guidelines will help protect you, your family, and
your home from attack.
1. You are advised not to leave the house alone.
2. Particular care should be taken during the hours of darkness. Wherever possible, arrange to complete journeys before night has fallen.
3. Review the security arrangements around your house,
making sure that all family members are aware of emergency measures such as Shield and Disillusionment
Charms, and, in the case of underage family members,
Side-Along-Apparition.
4. Agree on security questions with close friends and family
so as to detect Death Eaters masquerading as others by use
of the Polyjuice Potion (see page 2).
5. Should you feel that a family member, colleague, friend, or
neighbor is acting in a strange manner, contact the Magical Law Enforcement Squad at once. They may have been
put under the Imperius Curse (see page 4).

6. Should the Dark Mark appear over any dwelling place or
other building, DO NOT ENTER, but contact the Auror
office immediately.
7. Unconfirmed sightings suggest that the Death Eaters may
now be using Inferi (see page 10). Any sighting of an Inferius, or encounter with same, should be reported to the
Ministry IMMEDIATELY.
Harry grunted in his sleep and his face slid down the window an
inch or so, making his glasses still more lopsided, but he did not
wake up. An alarm clock, repaired by Harry several years ago,
ticked loudly on the sill, showing one minute to eleven. Beside it,
held in place by Harry’s relaxed hand, was a piece of parchment
covered in thin, slanting writing. Harry had read this letter so often
since its arrival three days ago that although it had been delivered
in a tightly furled scroll, it now lay quite flat.
Dear Harry,
If it is convenient to you, I shall call at number four, Privet
Drive this coming Friday at eleven P.M. to escort you to the
Burrow, where you have been invited to spend the remainder
of your school holidays.
If you are agreeable, I should also be glad of your assistance
in a matter to which I hope to attend on the way to the
Burrow. I shall explain this more fully when I see you.
Kindly send your answer by return of this owl. Hoping to
see you this Friday,
I am, yours most sincerely,

Albus Dumbledore

CHAPTER THREE
Though he already knew it by heart, Harry had been stealing
glances at this missive every few minutes since seven o’clock that
evening, when he had first taken up his position beside his bedroom window, which had a reasonable view of both ends of Privet
Drive. He knew it was pointless to keep rereading Dumbledore’s
words; Harry had sent back his “yes” with the delivering owl, as requested, and all he could do now was wait: Either Dumbledore was
going to come, or he was not.
But Harry had not packed. It just seemed too good to be true
that he was going to be rescued from the Dursleys after a mere fortnight of their company. He could not shrug off the feeling that
something was going to go wrong — his reply to Dumbledore’s letter might have gone astray; Dumbledore could be prevented from
collecting him; the letter might turn out not to be from Dumbledore at all, but a trick or joke or trap. Harry had not been able to
face packing and then being let down and having to unpack again.
The only gesture he had made to the possibility of a journey was to
shut his snowy owl, Hedwig, safely in her cage.
The minute hand on the alarm clock reached the number twelve
and, at that precise moment, the streetlamp outside the window
went out.
Harry awoke as though the sudden darkness were an alarm.
Hastily straightening his glasses and unsticking his cheek from the
glass, he pressed his nose against the window instead and squinted
down at the pavement. A tall figure in a long, billowing cloak was
walking up the garden path.
Harry jumped up as though he had received an electric shock,
knocked over his chair, and started snatching anything and every-



44



WILL AND WON’T
thing within reach from the floor and throwing it into the trunk.
Even as he lobbed a set of robes, two spellbooks, and a packet of
crisps across the room, the doorbell rang. Downstairs in the living
room his Uncle Vernon shouted, “Who the blazes is calling at this
time of night?”
Harry froze with a brass telescope in one hand and a pair of
trainers in the other. He had completely forgotten to warn the
Dursleys that Dumbledore might be coming. Feeling both panicky
and close to laughter, he clambered over the trunk and wrenched
open his bedroom door in time to hear a deep voice say, “Good
evening. You must be Mr. Dursley. I daresay Harry has told you I
would be coming for him?”
Harry ran down the stairs two at a time, coming to an abrupt
halt several steps from the bottom, as long experience had taught
him to remain out of arm’s reach of his uncle whenever possible.
There in the doorway stood a tall, thin man with waist-length silver hair and beard. Half-moon spectacles were perched on his
crooked nose, and he was wearing a long black traveling cloak and
a pointed hat. Vernon Dursley, whose mustache was quite as bushy
as Dumbledore’s, though black, and who was wearing a puce dressing gown, was staring at the visitor as though he could not believe
his tiny eyes.
“Judging by your look of stunned disbelief, Harry did not warn
you that I was coming,” said Dumbledore pleasantly. “However, let
us assume that you have invited me warmly into your house. It is
unwise to linger overlong on doorsteps in these troubled times.”
He stepped smartly over the threshold and closed the front door
behind him.



45

CHAPTER THREE
“It is a long time since my last visit,” said Dumbledore, peering
down his crooked nose at Uncle Vernon. “I must say, your agapanthus are flourishing.”
Vernon Dursley said nothing at all. Harry did not doubt that
speech would return to him, and soon — the vein pulsing in his
uncle’s temple was reaching danger point — but something about
Dumbledore seemed to have robbed him temporarily of breath. It
might have been the blatant wizardishness of his appearance, but it
might, too, have been that even Uncle Vernon could sense that
here was a man whom it would be very difficult to bully.
“Ah, good evening Harry,” said Dumbledore, looking up at him
through his half-moon glasses with a most satisfied expression.
“Excellent, excellent.”
These words seemed to rouse Uncle Vernon. It was clear that as
far as he was concerned, any man who could look at Harry and say
“excellent” was a man with whom he could never see eye to eye.
“I don’t mean to be rude —” he began, in a tone that threatened
rudeness in every syllable.
“— yet, sadly, accidental rudeness occurs alarmingly often,”
Dumbledore finished the sentence gravely. “Best to say nothing at
all, my dear man. Ah, and this must be Petunia.”
The kitchen door had opened, and there stood Harry’s aunt,
wearing rubber gloves and a housecoat over her nightdress, clearly
halfway through her usual pre-bedtime wipe-down of all the kitchen
surfaces. Her rather horsey face registered nothing but shock.
“Albus Dumbledore,” said Dumbledore, when Uncle Vernon
failed to effect an introduction. “We have corresponded, of course.”
Harry thought this an odd way of reminding Aunt Petunia that he



46



WILL AND WON’T
had once sent her an exploding letter, but Aunt Petunia did not
challenge the term. “And this must be your son, Dudley?”
Dudley had that moment peered round the living room door.
His large, blond head rising out of the stripy collar of his pajamas
looked oddly disembodied, his mouth gaping in astonishment and
fear. Dumbledore waited a moment or two, apparently to see
whether any of the Dursleys were going to say anything, but as the
silence stretched on he smiled.
“Shall we assume that you have invited me into your sitting
room?
Dudley scrambled out of the way as Dumbledore passed him.
Harry, still clutching the telescope and trainers, jumped the last
few stairs and followed Dumbledore, who had settled himself in
the armchair nearest the fire and was taking in the surroundings
with an expression of benign interest. He looked quite extraordinarily out of place.
“Aren’t — aren’t we leaving, sir?” Harry asked anxiously.
“Yes, indeed we are, but there are a few matters we need to discuss first,” said Dumbledore. “And I would prefer not to do so in
the open. We shall trespass upon your aunt and uncle’s hospitality
only a little longer.”
“You will, will you?”
Vernon Dursley had entered the room, Petunia at his shoulder,
and Dudley skulking behind them both.
“Yes,” said Dumbledore simply, “I shall.”
He drew his wand so rapidly that Harry barely saw it; with a casual flick, the sofa zoomed forward and knocked the knees out
from under all three of the Dursleys so that they collapsed upon it



CHAPTER THREE
in a heap. Another flick of the wand and the sofa zoomed back to
its original position.
“We may as well be comfortable,” said Dumbledore pleasantly.
As he replaced his wand in his pocket, Harry saw that his hand
was blackened and shriveled; it looked as though his flesh had been
burned away.
“Sir — what happened to your — ?”
“Later, Harry,” said Dumbledore. “Please sit down.”
Harry took the remaining armchair, choosing not to look at the
Dursleys, who seemed stunned into silence.
“I would assume that you were going to offer me refreshment,”
Dumbledore said to Uncle Vernon, “but the evidence so far suggests that that would be optimistic to the point of foolishness.”
A third twitch of the wand, and a dusty bottle and five glasses
appeared in midair. The bottle tipped and poured a generous measure of honey-colored liquid into each of the glasses, which then
floated to each person in the room.
“Madam Rosmerta’s finest oak-matured mead,” said Dumbledore, raising his glass to Harry, who caught hold of his own and
sipped. He had never tasted anything like it before, but enjoyed
it immensely. The Dursleys, after quick, scared looks at one another, tried to ignore their glasses completely, a difficult feat, as
they were nudging them gently on the sides of their heads. Harry
could not suppress a suspicion that Dumbledore was rather enjoying himself.
“Well, Harry,” said Dumbledore, turning toward him, “a difficulty has arisen which I hope you will be able to solve for us. By us,
I mean the Order of the Phoenix. But first of all I must tell you that



48



WILL AND WON’T
Sirius’s will was discovered a week ago and that he left you everything he owned.”
Over on the sofa, Uncle Vernon’s head turned, but Harry did
not look at him, nor could he think of anything to say except, “Oh.
Right.”
“This is, in the main, fairly straightforward,” Dumbledore went
on. “You add a reasonable amount of gold to your account at
Gringotts, and you inherit all of Sirius’s personal possessions. The
slightly problematic part of the legacy —”
“His godfather’s dead?” said Uncle Vernon loudly from the sofa.
Dumbledore and Harry both turned to look at him. The glass of
mead was now knocking quite insistently on the side of Vernon’s
head; he attempted to beat it away. “He’s dead? His godfather?”
“Yes,” said Dumbledore. He did not ask Harry why he had not
confided in the Dursleys. “Our problem,” he continued to Harry,
as if there had been no interruption, “is that Sirius also left you
number twelve, Grimmauld Place.”
“He’s been left a house?” said Uncle Vernon greedily, his small
eyes narrowing, but nobody answered him.
“You can keep using it as headquarters,” said Harry. “I don’t
care. You can have it, I don’t really want it.” Harry never wanted to
set foot in number twelve, Grimmauld Place again if he could help
it. He thought he would be haunted forever by the memory of
Sirius prowling its dark musty rooms alone, imprisoned within
the place he had wanted so desperately to leave.
“That is generous,” said Dumbledore. “We have, however, vacated the building temporarily.”
“Why?”



49



CHAPTER THREE
“Well,” said Dumbledore, ignoring the mutterings of Uncle
Vernon, who was now being rapped smartly over the head by the
persistent glass of mead, “Black family tradition decreed that
the house was handed down the direct line, to the next male with the
name of ‘Black.’ Sirius was the very last of the line as his younger
brother, Regulus, predeceased him and both were childless. While
his will makes it perfectly plain that he wants you to have the house,
it is nevertheless possible that some spell or enchantment has been
set upon the place to ensure that it cannot be owned by anyone
other than a pureblood.”
A vivid image of the shrieking, spitting portrait of Sirius’s
mother that hung in the hall of number twelve, Grimmauld Place
flashed into Harry’s mind. “I bet there has,” he said.
“Quite,” said Dumbledore. “And if such an enchantment exists,
then the ownership of the house is most likely to pass to the eldest
of Sirius’s living relatives, which would mean his cousin, Bellatrix
Lestrange.”
Without realizing what he was doing, Harry sprang to his feet;
the telescope and trainers in his lap rolled across the floor. Bellatrix
Lestrange, Sirius’s killer, inherit his house?
“No,” he said.
“Well, obviously we would prefer that she didn’t get it either,”
said Dumbledore calmly. “The situation is fraught with complications. We do not know whether the enchantments we ourselves
have placed upon it, for example, making it Unplottable, will hold
now that ownership has passed from Sirius’s hands. It might be that
Bellatrix will arrive on the doorstep at any moment. Naturally we
had to move out until such time as we have clarified the position.”
“But how are you going to find out if I’m allowed to own it?”


50



WILL AND WON’T
“Fortunately,” said Dumbledore, “there is a simple test.”
He placed his empty glass on a small table beside his chair, but
before he could do anything else, Uncle Vernon shouted, “Will you
get these ruddy things off us?”
Harry looked around; all three of the Dursleys were cowering
with their arms over their heads as their glasses bounced up and
down on their skulls, their contents flying everywhere.
“Oh, I’m so sorry,” said Dumbledore politely, and he raised his
wand again. All three glasses vanished. “But it would have been
better manners to drink it, you know.”
It looked as though Uncle Vernon was bursting with any number of unpleasant retorts, but he merely shrank back into the cushions with Aunt Petunia and Dudley and said nothing, keeping his
small piggy eyes on Dumbledore’s wand.
“You see,” Dumbledore said, turning back to Harry and again
speaking as though Uncle Vernon had not uttered, “if you have indeed inherited the house, you have also inherited —”
He flicked his wand for a fifth time. There was a loud crack, and
a house-elf appeared, with a snout for a nose, giant bat’s ears, and
enormous bloodshot eyes, crouching on the Dursleys’ shag carpet
and covered in grimy rags. Aunt Petunia let out a hair-raising
shriek; nothing this filthy had entered her house in living memory.
Dudley drew his large, bare, pink feet off the floor and sat with
them raised almost above his head, as though he thought the creature might run up his pajama trousers, and Uncle Vernon bellowed, “What the hell is that?”
“Kreacher,” finished Dumbledore.
“Kreacher won’t, Kreacher won’t, Kreacher won’t!” croaked the
house-elf, quite as loudly as Uncle Vernon, stamping his long,


51

CHAPTER THREE
gnarled feet and pulling his ears. “Kreacher belongs to Miss Bellatrix, oh yes, Kreacher belongs to the Blacks, Kreacher wants his
new mistress, Kreacher won’t go to the Potter brat, Kreacher won’t,
won’t, won’t —”
“As you can see, Harry,” said Dumbledore loudly, over Kreacher’s
continued croaks of “won’t, won’t, won’t,” “Kreacher is showing a
certain reluctance to pass into your ownership.”
“I don’t care,” said Harry again, looking with disgust at the
writhing, stamping house-elf. “I don’t want him.”
“Won’t, won’t, won’t, won’t —”
“You would prefer him to pass into the ownership of Bellatrix
Lestrange? Bearing in mind that he has lived at the headquarters of
the Order of the Phoenix for the past year?”
“Won’t, won’t, won’t, won’t —”
Harry stared at Dumbledore. He knew that Kreacher could not
be permitted to go and live with Bellatrix Lestrange, but the idea of
owning him, of having responsibility for the creature that had betrayed Sirius, was repugnant.
“Give him an order,” said Dumbledore. “If he has passed into
your ownership, he will have to obey. If not, then we shall have to
think of some other means of keeping him from his rightful mistress.”
“Won’t, won’t, won’t, WON’T !”
Kreacher’s voice had risen to a scream. Harry could think of
nothing to say, except, “Kreacher, shut up!”
It looked for a moment as though Kreacher was going to choke.
He grabbed his throat, his mouth still working furiously, his eyes
bulging. After a few seconds of frantic gulping, he threw himself
face forward onto the carpet (Aunt Petunia whimpered) and beat


52



WILL AND WON’T
the floor with his hands and feet, giving himself over to a violent,
but entirely silent, tantrum.
“Well, that simplifies matters,” said Dumbledore cheerfully. “It
seems that Sirius knew what he was doing. You are the rightful
owner of number twelve, Grimmauld Place and of Kreacher.”
“Do I — do I have to keep him with me?” Harry asked, aghast,
as Kreacher thrashed around at his feet.
“Not if you don’t want to,” said Dumbledore. “If I might make
a suggestion, you could send him to Hogwarts to work in the
kitchen there. In that way, the other house-elves could keep an eye
on him.”
“Yeah,” said Harry in relief, “yeah, I’ll do that. Er — Kreacher —
I want you to go to Hogwarts and work in the kitchens there with
the other house-elves.”
Kreacher, who was now lying flat on his back with his arms and
legs in the air, gave Harry one upside-down look of deepest
loathing and, with another loud crack, vanished.
“Good,” said Dumbledore. “There is also the matter of the hippogriff, Buckbeak. Hagrid has been looking after him since Sirius
died, but Buckbeak is yours now, so if you would prefer to make
different arrangements —”
“No,” said Harry at once, “he can stay with Hagrid. I think
Buckbeak would prefer that.”
“Hagrid will be delighted,” said Dumbledore, smiling. “He was
thrilled to see Buckbeak again. Incidentally, we have decided, in
the interests of Buckbeak’s safety, to rechristen him ‘Witherwings’
for the time being, though I doubt that the Ministry would ever
guess he is the hippogriff they once sentenced to death. Now,
Harry, is your trunk packed?”


CHAPTER THREE
“Erm . . .”
“Doubtful that I would turn up?” Dumbledore suggested
shrewdly.
“I’ll just go and — er — finish off,” said Harry hastily, hurrying
to pick up his fallen telescope and trainers.
It took him a little over ten minutes to track down everything he
needed; at last he had managed to extract his Invisibility Cloak
from under the bed, screwed the top back on his jar of colorchange ink, and forced the lid of his trunk shut on his cauldron.
Then, heaving his trunk in one hand and holding Hedwig’s cage in
the other, he made his way back downstairs.
He was disappointed to discover that Dumbledore was not waiting in the hall, which meant that he had to return to the living
room.
Nobody was talking. Dumbledore was humming quietly, apparently quite at his ease, but the atmosphere was thicker than cold
custard, and Harry did not dare look at the Dursleys as he said,
“Professor — I’m ready now.”
“Good,” said Dumbledore. “Just one last thing, then.” And he
turned to speak to the Dursleys once more.
“As you will no doubt be aware, Harry comes of age in a year’s
time —”
“No,” said Aunt Petunia, speaking for the first time since Dumbledore’s arrival.
“I’m sorry?” said Dumbledore politely.
“No, he doesn’t. He’s a month younger than Dudley, and Dudders
doesn’t turn eighteen until the year after next.”
“Ah,” said Dumbledore pleasantly, “but in the Wizarding world,
we come of age at seventeen.”


54



WILL AND WON’T
Uncle Vernon muttered, “Preposterous,” but Dumbledore ignored him.
“Now, as you already know, the wizard called Lord Voldemort
has returned to this country. The Wizarding community is currently in a state of open warfare. Harry, whom Lord Voldemort has
already attempted to kill on a number of occasions, is in even
greater danger now than the day when I left him upon your
doorstep fifteen years ago, with a letter explaining about his parents’ murder and expressing the hope that you would care for him
as though he were your own.”
Dumbledore paused, and although his voice remained light and
calm, and he gave no obvious sign of anger, Harry felt a kind of
chill emanating from him and noticed that the Dursleys drew very
slightly closer together.
“You did not do as I asked. You have never treated Harry as a
son. He has known nothing but neglect and often cruelty at your
hands. The best that can be said is that he has at least escaped the
appalling damage you have inflicted upon the unfortunate boy sitting between you.”
Both Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon looked around instinctively, as though expecting to see someone other than Dudley
squeezed between them.
“Us — mistreat Dudders? What d’you — ?” began Uncle Vernon furiously, but Dumbledore raised his finger for silence, a silence which fell as though he had struck Uncle Vernon dumb.
“The magic I evoked fifteen years ago means that Harry has powerful protection while he can still call this house ‘home.’ However
miserable he has been here, however unwelcome, however badly
treated, you have at least, grudgingly, allowed him houseroom. This




CHAPTER THREE
magic will cease to operate the moment that Harry turns seventeen;
in other words, at the moment he becomes a man. I ask only this:
that you allow Harry to return, once more, to this house, before his
seventeenth birthday, which will ensure that the protection continues until that time.”
None of the Dursleys said anything. Dudley was frowning
slightly, as though he was still trying to work out when he had ever
been mistreated. Uncle Vernon looked as though he had something
stuck in his throat; Aunt Petunia, however, was oddly flushed.
“Well, Harry . . . time for us to be off,” said Dumbledore at last,
standing up and straightening his long black cloak. “Until we meet
again,” he said to the Dursleys, who looked as though that moment
could wait forever as far as they were concerned, and after doffing
his hat, he swept from the room.
“Bye,” said Harry hastily to the Dursleys, and followed Dumbledore, who paused beside Harry’s trunk, upon which Hedwig’s
cage was perched.
“We do not want to be encumbered by these just now,” he said,
pulling out his wand again. “I shall send them to the Burrow to
await us there. However, I would like you to bring your Invisibility
Cloak . . . just in case.”
Harry extracted his cloak from his trunk with some difficulty,
trying not to show Dumbledore the mess within. When he had
stuffed it into an inside pocket of his jacket, Dumbledore waved
his wand and the trunk, cage, and Hedwig vanished. Dumbledore
then waved his wand again, and the front door opened onto cool,
misty darkness.
“And now, Harry, let us step out into the night and pursue that
flighty temptress, adventure.”

HORACE SLUGHORN

D

espite the fact that he had spent every waking moment of
the past few days hoping desperately that Dumbledore
would indeed come to fetch him, Harry felt distinctly awkward as
they set off down Privet Drive together. He had never had a proper
conversation with the headmaster outside of Hogwarts before;
there was usually a desk between them. The memory of their last
face-to-face encounter kept intruding too, and it rather heightened
Harry’s sense of embarrassment; he had shouted a lot on that occasion, not to mention done his best to smash several of Dumbledore’s most prized possessions.
Dumbledore, however, seemed completely relaxed.
“Keep your wand at the ready, Harry,” he said brightly.
“But I thought I’m not allowed to use magic outside school, sir?”
“If there is an attack,” said Dumbledore, “I give you permission
to use any counterjinx or curse that might occur to you. However,
I do not think you need worry about being attacked tonight.”

“Why not, sir?”
“You are with me,” said Dumbledore simply. “This will do,
Harry.”
He came to an abrupt halt at the end of Privet Drive.
“You have not, of course, passed your Apparition Test,” he said.
“No,” said Harry. “I thought you had to be seventeen?”
“You do,” said Dumbledore. “So you will need to hold on to my
arm very tightly. My left, if you don’t mind — as you have noticed,
my wand arm is a little fragile at the moment.”
Harry gripped Dumbledore’s proffered forearm.
“Very good,” said Dumbledore. “Well, here we go.”
Harry felt Dumbledore’s arm twist away from him and redoubled his grip; the next thing he knew, everything went black; he
was being pressed very hard from all directions; he could not
breathe, there were iron bands tightening around his chest; his eyeballs were being forced back into his head; his eardrums were being
pushed deeper into his skull and then —
He gulped great lungfuls of cold night air and opened his
streaming eyes. He felt as though he had just been forced through
a very tight rubber tube. It was a few seconds before he realized that
Privet Drive had vanished. He and Dumbledore were now standing in what appeared to be a deserted village square, in the center
of which stood an old war memorial and a few benches. His comprehension catching up with his senses, Harry realized that he had
just Apparated for the first time in his life.
“Are you all right?” asked Dumbledore, looking down at him solicitously. “The sensation does take some getting used to.”
“I’m fine,” said Harry, rubbing his ears, which felt as though



they had left Privet Drive rather reluctantly. “But I think I might
prefer brooms. . . .”
Dumbledore smiled, drew his traveling cloak a little more
tightly around his neck, and said, “This way.”
He set off at a brisk pace, past an empty inn and a few houses.
According to a clock on a nearby church, it was almost midnight.
“So tell me, Harry,” said Dumbledore. “Your scar . . . has it been
hurting at all?”
Harry raised a hand unconsciously to his forehead and rubbed
the lightning-shaped mark.
“No,” he said, “and I’ve been wondering about that. I thought it
would be burning all the time now Voldemort’s getting so powerful again.”
He glanced up at Dumbledore and saw that he was wearing a
satisfied expression.
“I, on the other hand, thought otherwise,” said Dumbledore.
“Lord Voldemort has finally realized the dangerous access to his
thoughts and feelings you have been enjoying. It appears that he is
now employing Occlumency against you.”
“Well, I’m not complaining,” said Harry, who missed neither
the disturbing dreams nor the startling flashes of insight into
Voldemort’s mind.
They turned a corner, passing a telephone box and a bus shelter.
Harry looked sideways at Dumbledore again. “Professor?”
“Harry?”
“Er — where exactly are we?”
“This, Harry, is the charming village of Budleigh Babberton.”
“And what are we doing here?”



CHAPTER FOUR
“Ah yes, of course, I haven’t told you,” said Dumbledore. “Well,
I have lost count of the number of times I have said this in recent
years, but we are, once again, one member of staff short. We are
here to persuade an old colleague of mine to come out of retirement and return to Hogwarts.”
“How can I help with that, sir?”
“Oh, I think we’ll find a use for you,” said Dumbledore vaguely.
“Left here, Harry.”
They proceeded up a steep, narrow street lined with houses. All
the windows were dark. The odd chill that had lain over Privet
Drive for two weeks persisted here too. Thinking of dementors,
Harry cast a look over his shoulder and grasped his wand reassuringly in his pocket.
“Professor, why couldn’t we just Apparate directly into your old
colleague’s house?”
“Because it would be quite as rude as kicking down the front
door,” said Dumbledore. “Courtesy dictates that we offer fellow
wizards the opportunity of denying us entry. In any case, most
Wizarding dwellings are magically protected from unwanted Apparators. At Hogwarts, for instance —”
“— you can’t Apparate anywhere inside the buildings or
grounds,” said Harry quickly. “Hermione Granger told me.”
“And she is quite right. We turn left again.”
The church clock chimed midnight behind them. Harry wondered why Dumbledore did not consider it rude to call on his old
colleague so late, but now that conversation had been established,
he had more pressing questions to ask.
“Sir, I saw in the Daily Prophet that Fudge has been sacked. . . .”
“Correct,” said Dumbledore, now turning up a steep side street.


HORACE SLUGHORN
“He has been replaced, as I am sure you also saw, by Rufus Scrimgeour, who used to be Head of the Auror office.”
“Is he . . . Do you think he’s good?” asked Harry.
“An interesting question,” said Dumbledore. “He is able, certainly. A more decisive and forceful personality than Cornelius.”
“Yes, but I meant —”
“I know what you meant. Rufus is a man of action and, having
fought Dark wizards for most of his working life, does not underestimate Lord Voldemort.”
Harry waited, but Dumbledore did not say anything about the
disagreement with Scrimgeour that the Daily Prophet had reported,
and he did not have the nerve to pursue the subject, so he changed
it. “And . . . sir . . . I saw about Madam Bones.”
“Yes,” said Dumbledore quietly. “A terrible loss. She was a great
witch. Just up here, I think — ouch.”
He had pointed with his injured hand.
“Professor, what happened to your — ?”
“I have no time to explain now,” said Dumbledore. “It is a
thrilling tale, I wish to do it justice.”
He smiled at Harry, who understood that he was not being
snubbed, and that he had permission to keep asking questions.
“Sir — I got a Ministry of Magic leaflet by owl, about security
measures we should all take against the Death Eaters. . . .”
“Yes, I received one myself,” said Dumbledore, still smiling.
“Did you find it useful?”
“Not really.”
“No, I thought not. You have not asked me, for instance, what is
my favorite flavor of jam, to check that I am indeed Professor
Dumbledore and not an impostor.”


CHAPTER FOUR
“I didn’t . . .” Harry began, not entirely sure whether he was being reprimanded or not.
“For future reference, Harry, it is raspberry . . . although of
course, if I were a Death Eater, I would have been sure to research
my own jam preferences before impersonating myself.”
“Er . . . right,” said Harry. “Well, on that leaflet, it said something about Inferi. What exactly are they? The leaflet wasn’t very
clear.”
“They are corpses,” said Dumbledore calmly. “Dead bodies that
have been bewitched to do a Dark wizard’s bidding. Inferi have not
been seen for a long time, however, not since Voldemort was last
powerful. . . . He killed enough people to make an army of them,
of course. This is the place, Harry, just here. . . .”
They were nearing a small, neat stone house set in its own garden. Harry was too busy digesting the horrible idea of Inferi to
have much attention left for anything else, but as they reached the
front gate, Dumbledore stopped dead and Harry walked into him.
“Oh dear. Oh dear, dear, dear.”
Harry followed his gaze up the carefully tended front path and
felt his heart sink. The front door was hanging off its hinges.
Dumbledore glanced up and down the street. It seemed quite
deserted.
“Wand out and follow me, Harry,” he said quietly.
He opened the gate and walked swiftly and silently up the garden path, Harry at his heels, then pushed the front door very slowly,
his wand raised and at the ready.
“Lumos.”
Dumbledore’s wand tip ignited, casting its light up a narrow
hallway. To the left, another door stood open. Holding his illumi

HORACE SLUGHORN
nated wand aloft, Dumbledore walked into the sitting room with
Harry right behind him.
A scene of total devastation met their eyes. A grandfather clock
lay splintered at their feet, its face cracked, its pendulum lying a little farther away like a dropped sword. A piano was on its side, its
keys strewn across the floor. The wreckage of a fallen chandelier
glittered nearby. Cushions lay deflated, feathers oozing from slashes
in their sides; fragments of glass and china lay like powder over
everything. Dumbledore raised his wand even higher, so that its
light was thrown upon the walls, where something darkly red and
glutinous was spattered over the wallpaper. Harry’s small intake of
breath made Dumbledore look around.
“Not pretty, is it?” he said heavily. “Yes, something horrible has
happened here.”
Dumbledore moved carefully into the middle of the room, scrutinizing the wreckage at his feet. Harry followed, gazing around,
half-scared of what he might see hidden behind the wreck of the piano or the overturned sofa, but there was no sign of a body.
“Maybe there was a fight and — and they dragged him off, Professor?” Harry suggested, trying not to imagine how badly
wounded a man would have to be to leave those stains spattered
halfway up the walls.
“I don’t think so,” said Dumbledore quietly, peering behind an
overstuffed armchair lying on its side.
“You mean he’s — ?”
“Still here somewhere? Yes.”
And without warning, Dumbledore swooped, plunging the tip of
his wand into the seat of the overstuffed armchair, which yelled,
“Ouch!”


CHAPTER FOUR
“Good evening, Horace,” said Dumbledore, straightening up
again.
Harry’s jaw dropped. Where a split second before there had been
an armchair, there now crouched an enormously fat, bald, old man
who was massaging his lower belly and squinting up at Dumbledore with an aggrieved and watery eye.
“There was no need to stick the wand in that hard,” he said
gruffly, clambering to his feet. “It hurt.”
The wandlight sparkled on his shiny pate, his prominent eyes,
his enormous, silver, walruslike mustache, and the highly polished
buttons on the maroon velvet jacket he was wearing over a pair of
lilac silk pajamas. The top of his head barely reached Dumbledore’s
chin.
“What gave it away?” he grunted as he staggered to his feet, still
rubbing his lower belly. He seemed remarkably unabashed for a
man who had just been discovered pretending to be an armchair.
“My dear Horace,” said Dumbledore, looking amused, “if the
Death Eaters really had come to call, the Dark Mark would have
been set over the house.”
The wizard clapped a pudgy hand to his vast forehead.
“The Dark Mark,” he muttered. “Knew there was something
. . . ah well. Wouldn’t have had time anyway, I’d only just put the
finishing touches to my upholstery when you entered the room.”
He heaved a great sigh that made the ends of his mustache
flutter.
“Would you like my assistance clearing up?” asked Dumbledore
politely.
“Please,” said the other.

HORACE SLUGHORN
They stood back to back, the tall thin wizard and the short
round one, and waved their wands in one identical sweeping
motion.
The furniture flew back to its original places; ornaments reformed in midair, feathers zoomed into their cushions; torn books
repaired themselves as they landed upon their shelves; oil lanterns
soared onto side tables and reignited; a vast collection of splintered
silver picture frames flew glittering across the room and alighted,
whole and untarnished, upon a desk; rips, cracks, and holes healed
everywhere, and the walls wiped themselves clean.
“What kind of blood was that, incidentally?” asked Dumbledore
loudly over the chiming of the newly unsmashed grandfather
clock.
“On the walls? Dragon,” shouted the wizard called Horace, as,
with a deafening grinding and tinkling, the chandelier screwed itself back into the ceiling.
There was a final plunk from the piano, and silence.
“Yes, dragon,” repeated the wizard conversationally. “My last
bottle, and prices are sky-high at the moment. Still, it might be
reusable.”
He stumped over to a small crystal bottle standing on top of a
sideboard and held it up to the light, examining the thick liquid
within.
“Hmm. Bit dusty.”
He set the bottle back on the sideboard and sighed. It was then
that his gaze fell upon Harry.
“Oho,” he said, his large round eyes flying to Harry’s forehead
and the lightning-shaped scar it bore. “Oho!”

“This,” said Dumbledore, moving forward to make the introduction, “is Harry Potter. Harry, this is an old friend and colleague
of mine, Horace Slughorn.”
Slughorn turned on Dumbledore, his expression shrewd. “So
that’s how you thought you’d persuade me, is it? Well, the answer’s
no, Albus.”
He pushed past Harry, his face turned resolutely away with the
air of a man trying to resist temptation.
“I suppose we can have a drink, at least?” asked Dumbledore.
“For old time’s sake?”
Slughorn hesitated.
“All right then, one drink,” he said ungraciously.
Dumbledore smiled at Harry and directed him toward a chair
not unlike the one that Slughorn had so recently impersonated,
which stood right beside the newly burning fire and a brightly
glowing oil lamp. Harry took the seat with the distinct impression
that Dumbledore, for some reason, wanted to keep him as visible
as possible. Certainly when Slughorn, who had been busy with decanters and glasses, turned to face the room again, his eyes fell immediately upon Harry.
“Hmpf,” he said, looking away quickly as though frightened of
hurting his eyes. “Here —” He gave a drink to Dumbledore, who
had sat down without invitation, thrust the tray at Harry, and then
sank into the cushions of the repaired sofa and a disgruntled silence. His legs were so short they did not touch the floor.
“Well, how have you been keeping, Horace?” Dumbledore
asked.
“Not so well,” said Slughorn at once. “Weak chest. Wheezy.



66

HORACE SLUGHORN
Rheumatism too. Can’t move like I used to. Well, that’s to be expected. Old age. Fatigue.”
“And yet you must have moved fairly quickly to prepare such a
welcome for us at such short notice,” said Dumbledore. “You can’t
have had more than three minutes’ warning?”
Slughorn said, half irritably, half proudly, “Two. Didn’t hear my
Intruder Charm go off, I was taking a bath. Still,” he added sternly,
seeming to pull himself back together again, “the fact remains that
I’m an old man, Albus. A tired old man who’s earned the right to a
quiet life and a few creature comforts.”
He certainly had those, thought Harry, looking around the
room. It was stuffy and cluttered, yet nobody could say it was uncomfortable; there were soft chairs and footstools, drinks and
books, boxes of chocolates and plump cushions. If Harry had not
known who lived there, he would have guessed at a rich, fussy old
lady.
“You’re not yet as old as I am, Horace,” said Dumbledore.
“Well, maybe you ought to think about retirement yourself,”
said Slughorn bluntly. His pale gooseberry eyes had found Dumbledore’s injured hand. “Reactions not what they were, I see.”
“You’re quite right,” said Dumbledore serenely, shaking back his
sleeve to reveal the tips of those burned and blackened fingers; the
sight of them made the back of Harry’s neck prickle unpleasantly.
“I am undoubtedly slower than I was. But on the other hand . . .”
He shrugged and spread his hands wide, as though to say that
age had its compensations, and Harry noticed a ring on his uninjured hand that he had never seen Dumbledore wear before: It was
large, rather clumsily made of what looked like gold, and was set



CHAPTER FOUR
with a heavy black stone that had cracked down the middle.
Slughorn’s eyes lingered for a moment on the ring too, and Harry
saw a tiny frown momentarily crease his wide forehead.
“So, all these precautions against intruders, Horace . . . are they
for the Death Eaters’ benefit, or mine?” asked Dumbledore.
“What would the Death Eaters want with a poor broken-down
old buffer like me?” demanded Slughorn.
“I imagine that they would want you to turn your considerable
talents to coercion, torture, and murder,” said Dumbledore. “Are
you really telling me that they haven’t come recruiting yet?”
Slughorn eyed Dumbledore balefully for a moment, then muttered, “I haven’t given them the chance. I’ve been on the move for
a year. Never stay in one place more than a week. Move from Muggle house to Muggle house — the owners of this place are on holiday in the Canary Islands — it’s been very pleasant, I’ll be sorry to
leave. It’s quite easy once you know how, one simple Freezing
Charm on these absurd burglar alarms they use instead of Sneakoscopes and make sure the neighbors don’t spot you bringing in the
piano.”
“Ingenious,” said Dumbledore. “But it sounds a rather tiring existence for a broken-down old buffer in search of a quiet life. Now,
if you were to return to Hogwarts —”
“If you’re going to tell me my life would be more peaceful at that
pestilential school, you can save your breath, Albus! I might have
been in hiding, but some funny rumors have reached me since Dolores Umbridge left! If that’s how you treat teachers these days —”
“Professor Umbridge ran afoul of our centaur herd,” said Dumbledore. “I think you, Horace, would have known better than to

stride into the forest and call a horde of angry centaurs ‘filthy halfbreeds.’ ”
“That’s what she did, did she?” said Slughorn. “Idiotic woman.
Never liked her.”
Harry chuckled and both Dumbledore and Slughorn looked
round at him.
“Sorry,” Harry said hastily. “It’s just — I didn’t like her either.”
Dumbledore stood up rather suddenly.
“Are you leaving?” asked Slughorn at once, looking hopeful.
“No, I was wondering whether I might use your bathroom,” said
Dumbledore.
“Oh,” said Slughorn, clearly disappointed. “Second on the left
down the hall.”
Dumbledore strode from the room. Once the door had closed
behind him, there was silence. After a few moments, Slughorn got
to his feet but seemed uncertain what to do with himself. He shot a
furtive look at Harry, then crossed to the fire and turned his back
on it, warming his wide behind.
“Don’t think I don’t know why he’s brought you,” he said
abruptly.
Harry merely looked at Slughorn. Slughorn’s watery eyes slid
over Harry’s scar, this time taking in the rest of his face.
“You look very like your father.”
“Yeah, I’ve been told,” said Harry.
“Except for your eyes. You’ve got —”
“My mother’s eyes, yeah.” Harry had heard it so often he found
it a bit wearing.
“Hmpf. Yes, well. You shouldn’t have favorites as a teacher, of

CHAPTER FOUR
course, but she was one of mine. Your mother,” Slughorn added, in
answer to Harry’s questioning look. “Lily Evans. One of the brightest I ever taught. Vivacious, you know. Charming girl. I used to tell
her she ought to have been in my House. Very cheeky answers I
used to get back too.”
“Which was your House?”
“I was Head of Slytherin,” said Slughorn. “Oh, now,” he went
on quickly, seeing the expression on Harry’s face and wagging a
stubby finger at him, “don’t go holding that against me! You’ll be
Gryffindor like her, I suppose? Yes, it usually goes in families. Not
always, though. Ever heard of Sirius Black? You must have done —
been in the papers for the last couple of years — died a few weeks
ago —”
It was as though an invisible hand had twisted Harry’s intestines
and held them tight.
“Well, anyway, he was a big pal of your father’s at school. The
whole Black family had been in my House, but Sirius ended up
in Gryffindor! Shame — he was a talented boy. I got his brother,
Regulus, when he came along, but I’d have liked the set.”
He sounded like an enthusiastic collector who had been outbid
at auction. Apparently lost in memories, he gazed at the opposite
wall, turning idly on the spot to ensure an even heat on his backside.
“Your mother was Muggle-born, of course. Couldn’t believe it
when I found out. Thought she must have been pure-blood, she
was so good.”
“One of my best friends is Muggle-born,” said Harry, “and she’s
the best in our year.”
“Funny how that sometimes happens, isn’t it?” said Slughorn.



HORACE SLUGHORN
“Not really,” said Harry coldly.
Slughorn looked down at him in surprise. “You mustn’t think
I’m prejudiced!” he said. “No, no, no! Haven’t I just said your
mother was one of my all-time favorite students? And there was
Dirk Cresswell in the year after her too — now Head of the Goblin Liaison Office, of course — another Muggle-born, a very gifted
student, and still gives me excellent inside information on the
goings-on at Gringotts!”
He bounced up and down a little, smiling in a self-satisfied way,
and pointed at the many glittering photograph frames on the
dresser, each peopled with tiny moving occupants.
“All ex-students, all signed. You’ll notice Barnabas Cuffe, editor
of the Daily Prophet, he’s always interested to hear my take on the
day’s news. And Ambrosius Flume, of Honeydukes — a hamper
every birthday, and all because I was able to give him an introduction to Ciceron Harkiss, who gave him his first job! And at the
back — you’ll see her if you just crane your neck — that’s Gwenog
Jones, who of course captains the Holyhead Harpies. . . . People
are always astonished to hear I’m on first-name terms with the
Harpies, and free tickets whenever I want them!”
This thought seemed to cheer him up enormously.
“And all these people know where to find you, to send you
stuff?” asked Harry, who could not help wondering why the Death
Eaters had not yet tracked down Slughorn if hampers of sweets,
Quidditch tickets, and visitors craving his advice and opinions
could find him.
The smile slid from Slughorn’s face as quickly as the blood from
his walls.



CHAPTER FOUR
“Of course not,” he said, looking down at Harry. “I have been
out of touch with everybody for a year.”
Harry had the impression that the words shocked Slughorn himself; he looked quite unsettled for a moment. Then he shrugged.
“Still . . . the prudent wizard keeps his head down in such times.
All very well for Dumbledore to talk, but taking up a post at Hogwarts just now would be tantamount to declaring my public allegiance to the Order of the Phoenix! And while I’m sure they’re very
admirable and brave and all the rest of it, I don’t personally fancy
the mortality rate —”
“You don’t have to join the Order to teach at Hogwarts,” said
Harry, who could not quite keep a note of derision out of his voice:
It was hard to sympathize with Slughorn’s cosseted existence when
he remembered Sirius, crouching in a cave and living on rats.
“Most of the teachers aren’t in it, and none of them has ever been
killed — well, unless you count Quirrell, and he got what he deserved seeing as he was working with Voldemort.”
Harry had been sure Slughorn would be one of those wizards
who could not bear to hear Voldemort’s name spoken aloud, and
was not disappointed: Slughorn gave a shudder and a squawk of
protest, which Harry ignored.
“I reckon the staff are safer than most people while Dumbledore’s headmaster; he’s supposed to be the only one Voldemort ever
feared, isn’t he?” Harry went on.
Slughorn gazed into space for a moment or two: He seemed to
be thinking over Harry’s words.
“Well, yes, it is true that He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named has
never sought a fight with Dumbledore,” he muttered grudgingly.



72



HORACE SLUGHORN
“And I suppose one could argue that as I have not joined the Death
Eaters, He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named can hardly count me a
friend . . . in which case, I might well be safer a little closer to Albus.
. . . I cannot pretend that Amelia Bones’s death did not shake
me. . . . If she, with all her Ministry contacts and protection . . .”
Dumbledore reentered the room and Slughorn jumped as
though he had forgotten he was in the house.
“Oh, there you are, Albus,” he said. “You’ve been a very long
time. Upset stomach?”
“No, I was merely reading the Muggle magazines,” said Dumbledore. “I do love knitting patterns. Well, Harry, we have trespassed upon Horace’s hospitality quite long enough; I think it is
time for us to leave.”
Not at all reluctant to obey, Harry jumped to his feet. Slughorn
seemed taken aback.
“You’re leaving?”
“Yes, indeed. I think I know a lost cause when I see one.”
“Lost. . . ?”
Slughorn seemed agitated. He twiddled his fat thumbs and fidgeted as he watched Dumbledore fasten his traveling cloak, and
Harry zip up his jacket.
“Well, I’m sorry you don’t want the job, Horace,” said Dumbledore, raising his uninjured hand in a farewell salute. “Hogwarts
would have been glad to see you back again. Our greatly increased
security notwithstanding, you will always be welcome to visit,
should you wish to.”
“Yes . . . well . . . very gracious . . . as I say . . .”
“Good-bye, then.”



CHAPTER FOUR
“Bye,” said Harry.
They were at the front door when there was a shout from behind
them.
“All right, all right, I’ll do it!”
Dumbledore turned to see Slughorn standing breathless in the
doorway to the sitting room.
“You will come out of retirement?”
“Yes, yes,” said Slughorn impatiently. “I must be mad, but yes.”
“Wonderful,” said Dumbledore, beaming. “Then, Horace, we
shall see you on the first of September.”
“Yes, I daresay you will,” grunted Slughorn.
As they set off down the garden path, Slughorn’s voice floated after them, “I’ll want a pay rise, Dumbledore!”
Dumbledore chuckled. The garden gate swung shut behind
them, and they set off back down the hill through the dark and the
swirling mist.
“Well done, Harry,” said Dumbledore.
“I didn’t do anything,” said Harry in surprise.
“Oh yes you did. You showed Horace exactly how much he
stands to gain by returning to Hogwarts. Did you like him?”
“Er . . .”
Harry wasn’t sure whether he liked Slughorn or not. He supposed he had been pleasant in his way, but he had also seemed vain
and, whatever he said to the contrary, much too surprised that a
Muggle-born should make a good witch.
“Horace,” said Dumbledore, relieving Harry of the responsibility to say any of this, “likes his comfort. He also likes the company
of the famous, the successful, and the powerful. He enjoys the feeling that he influences these people. He has never wanted to occupy

HORACE SLUGHORN
the throne himself; he prefers the backseat — more room to spread
out, you see. He used to handpick favorites at Hogwarts, sometimes for their ambition or their brains, sometimes for their charm
or their talent, and he had an uncanny knack for choosing those
who would go on to become outstanding in their various fields.
Horace formed a kind of club of his favorites with himself at the
center, making introductions, forging useful contacts between
members, and always reaping some kind of benefit in return,
whether a free box of his favorite crystalized pineapple or the
chance to recommend the next junior member of the Goblin
Liaison Office.”
Harry had a sudden and vivid mental image of a great swollen
spider, spinning a web around it, twitching a thread here and there
to bring its large and juicy flies a little closer.
“I tell you all this,” Dumbledore continued, “not to turn you
against Horace — or, as we must now call him, Professor Slughorn — but to put you on your guard. He will undoubtedly try to
collect you, Harry. You would be the jewel of his collection; ‘the
Boy Who Lived’ . . . or, as they call you these days, ‘the Chosen
One.’ ”
At these words, a chill that had nothing to do with the surrounding mist stole over Harry. He was reminded of words he had
heard a few weeks ago, words that had a horrible and particular
meaning to him: Neither can live while the other survives . . .
Dumbledore had stopped walking, level with the church they
had passed earlier.
“This will do, Harry. If you will grasp my arm.”
Braced this time, Harry was ready for the Apparition, but still
found it unpleasant. When the pressure disappeared and he found


CHAPTER FOUR
himself able to breathe again, he was standing in a country lane
beside Dumbledore and looking ahead to the crooked silhouette of
his second favorite building in the world: the Burrow. In spite of
the feeling of dread that had just swept through him, his spirits
could not help but lift at the sight of it. Ron was in there . . . and
so was Mrs. Weasley, who could cook better than anyone he
knew. . . .
“If you don’t mind, Harry,” said Dumbledore, as they passed
through the gate, “I’d like a few words with you before we part. In
private. Perhaps in here?”
Dumbledore pointed toward a run-down stone outhouse where
the Weasleys kept their broomsticks. A little puzzled, Harry followed Dumbledore through the creaking door into a space a little
smaller than the average cupboard. Dumbledore illuminated the
tip of his wand, so that it glowed like a torch, and smiled down at
Harry.
“I hope you will forgive me for mentioning it, Harry, but I am
pleased and a little proud at how well you seem to be coping after
everything that happened at the Ministry. Permit me to say that I
think Sirius would have been proud of you.”
Harry swallowed; his voice seemed to have deserted him. He did
not think he could stand to discuss Sirius; it had been painful
enough to hear Uncle Vernon say “His godfather’s dead?” and even
worse to hear Sirius’s name thrown out casually by Slughorn.
“It was cruel,” said Dumbledore softly, “that you and Sirius had
such a short time together. A brutal ending to what should have
been a long and happy relationship.”
Harry nodded, his eyes fixed resolutely on the spider now climbing Dumbledore’s hat. He could tell that Dumbledore understood,


76



HORACE SLUGHORN
that he might even suspect that until his letter arrived, Harry had
spent nearly all his time at the Dursleys’ lying on his bed, refusing
meals, and staring at the misted window, full of the chill emptiness
that he had come to associate with dementors.
“It’s just hard,” Harry said finally, in a low voice, “to realize he
won’t write to me again.”
His eyes burned suddenly and he blinked. He felt stupid for admitting it, but the fact that he had had someone outside Hogwarts
who cared what happened to him, almost like a parent, had been
one of the best things about discovering his godfather . . . and now
the post owls would never bring him that comfort again. . . .
“Sirius represented much to you that you had never known
before,” said Dumbledore gently. “Naturally, the loss is devastating. . . .”
“But while I was at the Dursleys’ . . .” interrupted Harry, his
voice growing stronger, “I realized I can’t shut myself away or — or
crack up. Sirius wouldn’t have wanted that, would he? And anyway,
life’s too short. . . . Look at Madam Bones, look at Emmeline
Vance. . . . It could be me next, couldn’t it? But if it is,” he said
fiercely, now looking straight into Dumbledore’s blue eyes gleaming in the wandlight, “I’ll make sure I take as many Death Eaters
with me as I can, and Voldemort too if I can manage it.”
“Spoken both like your mother and father’s son and Sirius’s true
godson!” said Dumbledore, with an approving pat on Harry’s back.
“I take my hat off to you — or I would, if I were not afraid of
showering you in spiders.
“And now, Harry, on a closely related subject . . . I gather that
you have been taking the Daily Prophet over the last two weeks?”
“Yes,” said Harry, and his heart beat a little faster.

“Then you will have seen that there have been not so much leaks
as floods concerning your adventure in the Hall of Prophecy?”
“Yes,” said Harry again. “And now everyone knows that I’m the
one —”
“No, they do not,” interrupted Dumbledore. “There are only
two people in the whole world who know the full contents of the
prophecy made about you and Lord Voldemort, and they are both
standing in this smelly, spidery broom shed. It is true, however,
that many have guessed, correctly, that Voldemort sent his Death
Eaters to steal a prophecy, and that the prophecy concerned you.
“Now, I think I am correct in saying that you have not told anybody that you know what the prophecy said?”
“No,” said Harry.
“A wise decision, on the whole,” said Dumbledore. “Although I
think you ought to relax it in favor of your friends, Mr. Ronald
Weasley and Miss Hermione Granger. Yes,” he continued, when
Harry looked startled, “I think they ought to know. You do them a
disservice by not confiding something this important to them.”
“I didn’t want —”
“— to worry or frighten them?” said Dumbledore, surveying
Harry over the top of his half-moon spectacles. “Or perhaps, to
confess that you yourself are worried and frightened? You need
your friends, Harry. As you so rightly said, Sirius would not have
wanted you to shut yourself away.”
Harry said nothing, but Dumbledore did not seem to require an
answer. He continued, “On a different, though related, subject, it
is my wish that you take private lessons with me this year.”



“Private — with you?” said Harry, surprised out of his preoccupied silence.
“Yes. I think it is time that I took a greater hand in your education.”
“What will you be teaching me, sir?”
“Oh, a little of this, a little of that,” said Dumbledore airily.
Harry waited hopefully, but Dumbledore did not elaborate, so
he asked something else that had been bothering him slightly.
“If I’m having lessons with you, I won’t have to do Occlumency
lessons with Snape, will I?”
“Professor Snape, Harry — and no, you will not.”
“Good,” said Harry in relief, “because they were a —”
He stopped, careful not to say what he really thought.
“I think the word ‘fiasco’ would be a good one here,” said Dumbledore, nodding.
Harry laughed.
“Well, that means I won’t see much of Professor Snape from now
on,” he said, “because he won’t let me carry on Potions unless I get
‘Outstanding’ in my O.W.L., which I know I haven’t.”
“Don’t count your owls before they are delivered,” said Dumbledore gravely. “Which, now I think of it, ought to be some time later
today. Now, two more things, Harry, before we part.
“Firstly, I wish you to keep your Invisibility Cloak with you at all
times from this moment onward. Even within Hogwarts itself. Just
in case, you understand me?”
Harry nodded.
“And lastly, while you stay here, the Burrow has been given the

highest security the Ministry of Magic can provide. These measures
have caused a certain amount of inconvenience to Arthur and
Molly — all their post, for instance, is being searched at the Ministry before being sent on. They do not mind in the slightest, for
their only concern is your safety. However, it would be poor repayment if you risked your neck while staying with them.”
“I understand,” said Harry quickly.
“Very well, then,” said Dumbledore, pushing open the broom
shed door and stepping out into the yard. “I see a light in the
kitchen. Let us not deprive Molly any longer of the chance to deplore how thin you are.”

arry and Dumbledore approached the back door of the
Burrow, which was surrounded by the familiar litter of
old Wellington boots and rusty cauldrons; Harry could hear the
soft clucking of sleepy chickens coming from a distant shed. Dumbledore knocked three times and Harry saw sudden movement behind the kitchen window.
“Who’s there?” said a nervous voice he recognized as Mrs.
Weasley’s. “Declare yourself!”
“It is I, Dumbledore, bringing Harry.”
The door opened at once. There stood Mrs. Weasley, short,
plump, and wearing an old green dressing gown.
“Harry, dear! Gracious, Albus, you gave me a fright, you said not
to expect you before morning!”
“We were lucky,” said Dumbledore, ushering Harry over the
threshold. “Slughorn proved much more persuadable than I had
expected. Harry’s doing, of course. Ah, hello, Nymphadora!”


CHAPTER FIVE
Harry looked around and saw that Mrs. Weasley was not alone,
despite the lateness of the hour. A young witch with a pale, heartshaped face and mousy brown hair was sitting at the table clutching a large mug between her hands.
“Hello, Professor,” she said. “Wotcher, Harry.”
“Hi, Tonks.”
Harry thought she looked drawn, even ill, and there was something forced in her smile. Certainly her appearance was less colorful than usual without her customary shade of bubble-gum-pink
hair.
“I’d better be off,” she said quickly, standing up and pulling her
cloak around her shoulders. “Thanks for the tea and sympathy,
Molly.”
“Please don’t leave on my account,” said Dumbledore courteously, “I cannot stay, I have urgent matters to discuss with Rufus
Scrimgeour.”
“No, no, I need to get going,” said Tonks, not meeting Dumbledore’s eyes. “ ’Night —”
“Dear, why not come to dinner at the weekend, Remus and
Mad-Eye are coming — ?”
“No, really, Molly . . . thanks anyway . . . Good night, everyone.
Tonks hurried past Dumbledore and Harry into the yard; a few
paces beyond the doorstep, she turned on the spot and vanished
into thin air. Harry noticed that Mrs. Weasley looked troubled.
“Well, I shall see you at Hogwarts, Harry,” said Dumbledore.
“Take care of yourself. Molly, your servant.”
He made Mrs. Weasley a bow and followed Tonks, vanishing at
precisely the same spot. Mrs. Weasley closed the door on the empty


AN EXCESS OF PHLEGM
yard and then steered Harry by the shoulders into the full glow of
the lantern on the table to examine his appearance.
“You’re like Ron,” she sighed, looking him up and down. “Both
of you look as though you’ve had Stretching Jinxes put on you. I
swear Ron’s grown four inches since I last bought him school robes.
Are you hungry, Harry?”
“Yeah, I am,” said Harry, suddenly realizing just how hungry he
was.
“Sit down, dear, I’ll knock something up.”
As Harry sat down, a furry ginger cat with a squashed face
jumped onto his knees and settled there, purring.
“So Hermione’s here?” he asked happily as he tickled Crookshanks behind the ears.
“Oh yes, she arrived the day before yesterday,” said Mrs. Weasley, rapping a large iron pot with her wand. It bounced onto the
stove with a loud clang and began to bubble at once. “Everyone’s in
bed, of course, we didn’t expect you for hours. Here you are —”
She tapped the pot again; it rose into the air, flew toward Harry,
and tipped over; Mrs. Weasley slid a bowl neatly beneath it just in
time to catch the stream of thick, steaming onion soup.
“Bread, dear?”
“Thanks, Mrs. Weasley.”
She waved her wand over her shoulder; a loaf of bread and a
knife soared gracefully onto the table; as the loaf sliced itself and
the soup pot dropped back onto the stove, Mrs. Weasley sat down
opposite him.
“So you persuaded Horace Slughorn to take the job?”
Harry nodded, his mouth so full of hot soup that he could not
speak.


83



CHAPTER FIVE
“He taught Arthur and me,” said Mrs. Weasley. “He was at Hogwarts for ages, started around the same time as Dumbledore, I
think. Did you like him?”
His mouth now full of bread, Harry shrugged and gave a noncommittal jerk of the head.
“I know what you mean,” said Mrs. Weasley, nodding wisely.
“Of course he can be charming when he wants to be, but Arthur’s
never liked him much. The Ministry’s littered with Slughorn’s old
favorites, he was always good at giving leg ups, but he never had
much time for Arthur — didn’t seem to think he was enough of a
highflier. Well, that just shows you, even Slughorn makes mistakes.
I don’t know whether Ron’s told you in any of his letters — it’s only
just happened — but Arthur’s been promoted!”
It could not have been clearer that Mrs. Weasley had been bursting to say this.
Harry swallowed a large amount of very hot soup and thought he
could feel his throat blistering. “That’s great!” he gasped.
“You are sweet,” beamed Mrs. Weasley, possibly taking his watering eyes for emotion at the news. “Yes, Rufus Scrimgeour has set
up several new offices in response to the present situation, and
Arthur’s heading the Office for the Detection and Confiscation of
Counterfeit Defensive Spells and Protective Objects. It’s a big job,
he’s got ten people reporting to him now!”
“What exactly — ?”
“Well, you see, in all the panic about You-Know-Who, odd
things have been cropping up for sale everywhere, things that are
supposed to guard against You-Know-Who and the Death Eaters.
You can imagine the kind of thing — so-called protective potions
that are really gravy with a bit of bubotuber pus added, or instruc

tions for defensive jinxes that actually make your ears fall off. . . .
Well, in the main the perpetrators are just people like Mundungus
Fletcher, who’ve never done an honest day’s work in their lives and
are taking advantage of how frightened everybody is, but every
now and then something really nasty turns up. The other day
Arthur confiscated a box of cursed Sneakoscopes that were almost
certainly planted by a Death Eater. So you see, it’s a very important
job, and I tell him it’s just silly to miss dealing with spark plugs and
toasters and all the rest of that Muggle rubbish.” Mrs. Weasley
ended her speech with a stern look, as if it had been Harry suggesting that it was natural to miss spark plugs.
“Is Mr. Weasley still at work?” Harry asked.
“Yes, he is. As a matter of fact, he’s a tiny bit late. . . . He said
he’d be back around midnight. . . .”
She turned to look at a large clock that was perched awkwardly
on top of a pile of sheets in the washing basket at the end of the
table. Harry recognized it at once: It had nine hands, each inscribed with the name of a family member, and usually hung on
the Weasleys’ sitting room wall, though its current position suggested that Mrs. Weasley had taken to carrying it around the house
with her. Every single one of its nine hands was now pointing at
“mortal peril.”
“It’s been like that for a while now,” said Mrs. Weasley, in an unconvincingly casual voice, “ever since You-Know-Who came back
into the open. I suppose everybody’s in mortal danger now. . . . I
don’t think it can be just our family . . . but I don’t know anyone
else who’s got a clock like this, so I can’t check. Oh!”
With a sudden exclamation she pointed at the clock’s face. Mr.
Weasley’s hand had switched to “traveling.”


85



CHAPTER FIVE
“He’s coming!”
And sure enough, a moment later there was a knock on the back
door. Mrs. Weasley jumped up and hurried to it; with one hand on
the doorknob and her face pressed against the wood she called
softly, “Arthur, is that you?”
“Yes,” came Mr. Weasley’s weary voice. “But I would say that
even if I were a Death Eater, dear. Ask the question!”
“Oh, honestly . . .”
“Molly!”
“All right, all right . . . What is your dearest ambition?”
“To find out how airplanes stay up.”
Mrs. Weasley nodded and turned the doorknob, but apparently
Mr. Weasley was holding tight to it on the other side, because the
door remained firmly shut.
“Molly! I’ve got to ask you your question first!”
“Arthur, really, this is just silly. . . .”
“What do you like me to call you when we’re alone together?”
Even by the dim light of the lantern Harry could tell that Mrs.
Weasley had turned bright red; he himself felt suddenly warm
around the ears and neck, and hastily gulped soup, clattering his
spoon as loudly as he could against the bowl.
“Mollywobbles,” whispered a mortified Mrs. Weasley into the
crack at the edge of the door.
“Correct,” said Mr. Weasley. “Now you can let me in.”
Mrs. Weasley opened the door to reveal her husband, a thin,
balding, red-haired wizard wearing horn-rimmed spectacles and a
long and dusty traveling cloak.
“I still don’t see why we have to go through that every time you
come home,” said Mrs. Weasley, still pink in the face as she helped

her husband out of his cloak. “I mean, a Death Eater might have
forced the answer out of you before impersonating you!”
“I know, dear, but it’s Ministry procedure, and I have to set an
example. Something smells good — onion soup?”
Mr. Weasley turned hopefully in the direction of the table.
“Harry! We didn’t expect you until morning!”
They shook hands, and Mr. Weasley dropped into the chair beside Harry as Mrs. Weasley set a bowl of soup in front of him too.
“Thanks, Molly. It’s been a tough night. Some idiot’s started selling Metamorph-Medals. Just sling them around your neck and
you’ll be able to change your appearance at will. A hundred thousand disguises, all for ten Galleons!”
“And what really happens when you put them on?”
“Mostly you just turn a fairly unpleasant orange color, but a couple of people have also sprouted tentaclelike warts all over their
bodies. As if St. Mungo’s didn’t have enough to do already!”
“It sounds like the sort of thing Fred and George would find
funny,” said Mrs. Weasley hesitantly. “Are you sure — ?”
“Of course I am!” said Mr. Weasley. “The boys wouldn’t do anything like that now, not when people are desperate for protection!”
“So is that why you’re late, Metamorph-Medals?”
“No, we got wind of a nasty backfiring jinx down in Elephant
and Castle, but luckily the Magical Law Enforcement Squad had
sorted it out by the time we got there. . . .”
Harry stifled a yawn behind his hand.
“Bed,” said an undeceived Mrs. Weasley at once. “I’ve got Fred
and George’s room all ready for you, you’ll have it to yourself.”
“Why, where are they?”
“Oh, they’re in Diagon Alley, sleeping in the little flat over their

CHAPTER FIVE
joke shop as they’re so busy,” said Mrs. Weasley. “I must say, I
didn’t approve at first, but they do seem to have a bit of a flair for
business! Come on, dear, your trunk’s already up there.”
“ ’Night, Mr. Weasley,” said Harry, pushing back his chair.
Crookshanks leapt lightly from his lap and slunk out of the room.
“G’night, Harry,” said Mr. Weasley.
Harry saw Mrs. Weasley glance at the clock in the washing
basket as they left the kitchen. All the hands were once again at
“mortal peril.”
Fred and George’s bedroom was on the second floor. Mrs. Weasley pointed her wand at a lamp on the bedside table and it ignited
at once, bathing the room in a pleasant golden glow. Though a
large vase of flowers had been placed on a desk in front of the small
window, their perfume could not disguise the lingering smell of
what Harry thought was gunpowder. A considerable amount of
floor space was devoted to a vast number of unmarked, sealed cardboard boxes, amongst which stood Harry’s school trunk. The room
looked as though it was being used as a temporary warehouse.
Hedwig hooted happily at Harry from her perch on top of a
large wardrobe, then took off through the window; Harry knew
she had been waiting to see him before going hunting. Harry bade
Mrs. Weasley good night, put on pajamas, and got into one of the
beds. There was something hard inside the pillowcase. He groped
inside it and pulled out a sticky purple-and-orange sweet, which he
recognized as a Puking Pastille. Smiling to himself, he rolled over
and was instantly asleep.
Seconds later, or so it seemed to Harry, he was awakened by
what sounded like cannon fire as the door burst open. Sitting bolt
upright, he heard the rasp of the curtains being pulled back: The




AN EXCESS OF PHLEGM
dazzling sunlight seemed to poke him hard in both eyes. Shielding
them with one hand, he groped hopelessly for his glasses with the
other.
“Wuzzgoinon?”
“We didn’t know you were here already!” said a loud and excited
voice, and he received a sharp blow to the top of the head.
“Ron, don’t hit him!” said a girl’s voice reproachfully.
Harry’s hand found his glasses and he shoved them on, though
the light was so bright he could hardly see anyway. A long, looming shadow quivered in front of him for a moment; he blinked and
Ron Weasley came into focus, grinning down at him.
“All right?”
“Never been better,” said Harry, rubbing the top of his head and
slumping back onto his pillows. “You?”
“Not bad,” said Ron, pulling over a cardboard box and sitting on
it. “When did you get here? Mum’s only just told us!”
“About one o’clock this morning.”
“Were the Muggles all right? Did they treat you okay?”
“Same as usual,” said Harry, as Hermione perched herself on the
edge of his bed, “they didn’t talk to me much, but I like it better
that way. How’re you, Hermione?”
“Oh, I’m fine,” said Hermione, who was scrutinizing Harry as
though he was sickening for something. He thought he knew what
was behind this, and as he had no wish to discuss Sirius’s death or
any other miserable subject at the moment, he said, “What’s the
time? Have I missed breakfast?”
“Don’t worry about that, Mum’s bringing you up a tray; she
reckons you look underfed,” said Ron, rolling his eyes. “So, what’s
been going on?”


CHAPTER FIVE
“Nothing much, I’ve just been stuck at my aunt and uncle’s,
haven’t I?”
“Come off it!” said Ron. “You’ve been off with Dumbledore!”
“It wasn’t that exciting. He just wanted me to help him persuade
this old teacher to come out of retirement. His name’s Horace
Slughorn.”
“Oh,” said Ron, looking disappointed. “We thought —”
Hermione flashed a warning look at Ron, and Ron changed tack
at top speed.
“— we thought it’d be something like that.”
“You did?” said Harry, amused.
“Yeah . . . yeah, now Umbridge has left, obviously we need a new
Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher, don’t we? So, er, what’s he
like?”
“He looks a bit like a walrus, and he used to be Head of
Slytherin,” said Harry. “Something wrong, Hermione?”
She was watching him as though expecting strange symptoms to
manifest themselves at any moment. She rearranged her features
hastily in an unconvincing smile.
“No, of course not! So, um, did Slughorn seem like he’ll be a
good teacher?”
“Dunno,” said Harry. “He can’t be worse than Umbridge, can
he?”
“I know someone who’s worse than Umbridge,” said a voice
from the doorway. Ron’s younger sister slouched into the room,
looking irritable. “Hi, Harry.”
“What’s up with you?” Ron asked.
“It’s her,” said Ginny, plonking herself down on Harry’s bed.
“She’s driving me mad.”


AN EXCESS OF PHLEGM
“What’s she done now?” asked Hermione sympathetically.
“It’s the way she talks to me — you’d think I was about three!”
“I know,” said Hermione, dropping her voice. “She’s so full of
herself.”
Harry was astonished to hear Hermione talking about Mrs.
Weasley like this and could not blame Ron for saying angrily,
“Can’t you two lay off her for five seconds?”
“Oh, that’s right, defend her,” snapped Ginny. “We all know you
can’t get enough of her.”
This seemed an odd comment to make about Ron’s mother.
Starting to feel that he was missing something, Harry said, “Who
are you — ?”
But his question was answered before he could finish it. The
bedroom door flew open again, and Harry instinctively yanked the
bedcovers up to his chin so hard that Hermione and Ginny slid off
the bed onto the floor.
A young woman was standing in the doorway, a woman of such
breathtaking beauty that the room seemed to have become strangely
airless. She was tall and willowy with long blonde hair and appeared
to emanate a faint, silvery glow. To complete this vision of perfection, she was carrying a heavily laden breakfast tray.
“ ’Arry,” she said in a throaty voice. “Eet ’as been too long!”
As she swept over the threshold toward him, Mrs. Weasley was
revealed, bobbing along in her wake, looking rather cross.
“There was no need to bring up the tray, I was just about to do
it myself!”
“Eet was no trouble,” said Fleur Delacour, setting the tray across
Harry’s knees and then swooping to kiss him on each cheek: He felt
the places where her mouth had touched him burn. “I ’ave been

CHAPTER FIVE
longing to see ’im. You remember my seester, Gabrielle? She never
stops talking about ’Arry Potter. She will be delighted to see you
again.”
“Oh . . . is she here too?” Harry croaked.
“No, no, silly boy,” said Fleur with a tinkling laugh, “I mean
next summer, when we — but do you not know?”
Her great blue eyes widened and she looked reproachfully at
Mrs. Weasley, who said, “We hadn’t got around to telling him yet.”
Fleur turned back to Harry, swinging her silvery sheet of hair so
that it whipped Mrs. Weasley across the face.
“Bill and I are going to be married!”
“Oh,” said Harry blankly. He could not help noticing how Mrs.
Weasley, Hermione, and Ginny were all determinedly avoiding one
another’s gaze. “Wow. Er — congratulations!”
She swooped down upon him and kissed him again.
“Bill is very busy at ze moment, working very ’ard, and I only
work part-time at Gringotts for my Eenglish, so he brought me ’ere
for a few days to get to know ’is family properly. I was so pleased to
’ear you would be coming — zere isn’t much to do ’ere, unless you
like cooking and chickens! Well — enjoy your breakfast, ’Arry!”
With these words she turned gracefully and seemed to float out
of the room, closing the door quietly behind her.
Mrs. Weasley made a noise that sounded like “tchah!”
“Mum hates her,” said Ginny quietly.
“I do not hate her!” said Mrs. Weasley in a cross whisper. “I just
think they’ve hurried into this engagement, that’s all!”
“They’ve known each other a year,” said Ron, who looked oddly
groggy and was staring at the closed door.
“Well, that’s not very long! I know why it’s happened, of course.

It’s all this uncertainty with You-Know-Who coming back, people
think they might be dead tomorrow, so they’re rushing all sorts of
decisions they’d normally take time over. It was the same last time
he was powerful, people eloping left, right, and center —”
“Including you and Dad,” said Ginny slyly.
“Yes, well, your father and I were made for each other, what was
the point in waiting?” said Mrs. Weasley. “Whereas Bill and Fleur
. . . well . . . what have they really got in common? He’s a hardworking, down-to-earth sort of person, whereas she’s —”
“A cow,” said Ginny, nodding. “But Bill’s not that down-toearth. He’s a Curse-Breaker, isn’t he, he likes a bit of adventure, a
bit of glamour. . . . I expect that’s why he’s gone for Phlegm.”
“Stop calling her that, Ginny,” said Mrs. Weasley sharply, as
Harry and Hermione laughed. “Well, I’d better get on. . . . Eat
your eggs while they’re warm, Harry.”
Looking careworn, she left the room. Ron still seemed slightly
punch-drunk; he was shaking his head experimentally like a dog
trying to rid its ears of water.
“Don’t you get used to her if she’s staying in the same house?”
Harry asked.
“Well, you do,” said Ron, “but if she jumps out at you unexpectedly, like then . . .”
“It’s pathetic,” said Hermione furiously, striding away from Ron
as far as she could go and turning to face him with her arms folded
once she had reached the wall.
“You don’t really want her around forever?” Ginny asked Ron
incredulously. When he merely shrugged, she said, “Well, Mum’s
going to put a stop to it if she can, I bet you anything.”
“How’s she going to manage that?” asked Harry.

“She keeps trying to get Tonks round for dinner. I think she’s
hoping Bill will fall for Tonks instead. I hope he does, I’d much
rather have her in the family.”
“Yeah, that’ll work,” said Ron sarcastically. “Listen, no bloke in
his right mind’s going to fancy Tonks when Fleur’s around. I mean,
Tonks is okay-looking when she isn’t doing stupid things to her
hair and her nose, but —”
“She’s a damn sight nicer than Phlegm,’’ said Ginny
“And she’s more intelligent, she’s an Auror!” said Hermione from
the corner.
“Fleur’s not stupid, she was good enough to enter the Triwizard
Tournament,” said Harry.
“Not you as well!” said Hermione bitterly.
“I suppose you like the way Phlegm says ‘ ’Arry,’ do you?” asked
Ginny scornfully.
“No,” said Harry, wishing he hadn’t spoken, “I was just saying,
Phlegm — I mean, Fleur —”
“I’d much rather have Tonks in the family,” said Ginny. “At least
she’s a laugh.”
“She hasn’t been much of a laugh lately,” said Ron. “Every time
I’ve seen her she’s looked more like Moaning Myrtle.”
“That’s not fair,” snapped Hermione. “She still hasn’t got over
what happened . . . you know . . . I mean, he was her cousin!”
Harry’s heart sank. They had arrived at Sirius. He picked up a
fork and began shoveling scrambled eggs into his mouth, hoping to
deflect any invitation to join in this part of the conversation.
“Tonks and Sirius barely knew each other!” said Ron. “Sirius was
in Azkaban half her life and before that their families never met —”

“That’s not the point,” said Hermione. “She thinks it was her
fault he died!”
“How does she work that one out?” asked Harry, in spite of
himself.
“Well, she was fighting Bellatrix Lestrange, wasn’t she? I think
she feels that if only she had finished her off, Bellatrix couldn’t have
killed Sirius.”
“That’s stupid,” said Ron.
“It’s survivor’s guilt,” said Hermione. “I know Lupin’s tried to
talk her round, but she’s still really down. She’s actually having
trouble with her Metamorphosing!”
“With her — ?”
“She can’t change her appearance like she used to,” explained
Hermione. “I think her powers must have been affected by shock,
or something.”
“I didn’t know that could happen,” said Harry.
“Nor did I,” said Hermione, “but I suppose if you’re really depressed . . .”
The door opened again and Mrs. Weasley popped her head in.
“Ginny,” she whispered, “come downstairs and help me with the
lunch.”
“I’m talking to this lot!” said Ginny, outraged.
“Now!” said Mrs. Weasley, and withdrew.
“She only wants me there so she doesn’t have to be alone with
Phlegm!” said Ginny crossly. She swung her long red hair around
in a very good imitation of Fleur and pranced across the room with
her arms held aloft like a ballerina.
“You lot had better come down quickly too,” she said as she left.

Harry took advantage of the temporary silence to eat more
breakfast. Hermione was peering into Fred and George’s boxes,
though every now and then she cast sideways looks at Harry. Ron,
who was now helping himself to Harry’s toast, was still gazing
dreamily at the door.
“What’s this?” Hermione asked eventually, holding up what
looked like a small telescope.
“Dunno,” said Ron, “but if Fred and George’ve left it here, it’s
probably not ready for the joke shop yet, so be careful.”
“Your mum said the shop’s going well,” said Harry. “Said Fred
and George have got a real flair for business.”
“That’s an understatement,” said Ron. “They’re raking in the
Galleons! I can’t wait to see the place, we haven’t been to Diagon
Alley yet, because Mum says Dad’s got to be there for extra security
and he’s been really busy at work, but it sounds excellent.”
“And what about Percy?” asked Harry; the third-eldest Weasley
brother had fallen out with the rest of the family. “Is he talking to
your mum and dad again?”
“Nope,” said Ron.
“But he knows your dad was right all along now about Voldemort being back —”
“Dumbledore says people find it far easier to forgive others for
being wrong than being right,” said Hermione. “I heard him
telling your mum, Ron.”
“Sounds like the sort of mental thing Dumbledore would say,”
said Ron.
“He’s going to be giving me private lessons this year,” said Harry
conversationally.

Ron choked on his bit of toast, and Hermione gasped.
“You kept that quiet!” said Ron.
“I only just remembered,” said Harry honestly. “He told me last
night in your broom shed.”
“Blimey . . . private lessons with Dumbledore!” said Ron, looking impressed. “I wonder why he’s . . . ?”
His voice tailed away. Harry saw him and Hermione exchange
looks. Harry laid down his knife and fork, his heart beating rather
fast considering that all he was doing was sitting in bed. Dumbledore had said to do it. . . . Why not now? He fixed his eyes on his
fork, which was gleaming in the sunlight streaming into his lap,
and said, “I don’t know exactly why he’s going to be giving me
lessons, but I think it must be because of the prophecy.”
Neither Ron nor Hermione spoke. Harry had the impression
that both had frozen. He continued, still speaking to his fork, “You
know, the one they were trying to steal at the Ministry.”
“Nobody knows what it said, though,” said Hermione quickly.
“It got smashed.”
“Although the Prophet says —” began Ron, but Hermione said,
“Shh!”
“The Prophet’s got it right,” said Harry, looking up at them both
with a great effort: Hermione seemed frightened and Ron amazed.
“That glass ball that smashed wasn’t the only record of the
prophecy. I heard the whole thing in Dumbledore’s office, he was
the one the prophecy was made to, so he could tell me. From what
it said,” Harry took a deep breath, “it looks like I’m the one who’s
got to finish off Voldemort. . . . At least, it said neither of us could
live while the other survives.”

The three of them gazed at one another in silence for a moment.
Then there was a loud bang and Hermione vanished behind a puff
of black smoke.
“Hermione!” shouted Harry and Ron; the breakfast tray slid to
the floor with a crash.
Hermione emerged, coughing, out of the smoke, clutching the
telescope and sporting a brilliantly purple black eye.
“I squeezed it and it — it punched me!” she gasped.
And sure enough, they now saw a tiny fist on a long spring protruding from the end of the telescope.
“Don’t worry,” said Ron, who was plainly trying not to laugh,
“Mum’ll fix that, she’s good at healing minor injuries —”
“Oh well, never mind that now!” said Hermione hastily. “Harry,
oh, Harry . . .”
She sat down on the edge of his bed again.
“We wondered, after we got back from the Ministry . . . Obviously, we didn’t want to say anything to you, but from what Lucius
Malfoy said about the prophecy, how it was about you and Voldemort, well, we thought it might be something like this. . . . Oh,
Harry . . .” She stared at him, then whispered, “Are you scared?”
“Not as much as I was,” said Harry. “When I first heard it, I was
. . . but now, it seems as though I always knew I’d have to face him
in the end. . . .”
“When we heard Dumbledore was collecting you in person, we
thought he might be telling you something or showing you something to do with the prophecy,” said Ron eagerly. “And we were
kind of right, weren’t we? He wouldn’t be giving you lessons if he
thought you were a goner, wouldn’t waste his time — he must
think you’ve got a chance!”

“That’s true,” said Hermione. “I wonder what he’ll teach you,
Harry? Really advanced defensive magic, probably . . . powerful
countercurses . . . anti-jinxes . . .”
Harry did not really listen. A warmth was spreading through
him that had nothing to do with the sunlight; a tight obstruction
in his chest seemed to be dissolving. He knew that Ron and
Hermione were more shocked than they were letting on, but the
mere fact that they were still there on either side of him, speaking
bracing words of comfort, not shrinking from him as though he
were contaminated or dangerous, was worth more than he could
ever tell them.
“. . . and evasive enchantments generally,” concluded Hermione. “Well, at least you know one lesson you’ll be having this year,
that’s one more than Ron and me. I wonder when our O.W.L. results will come?”
“Can’t be long now, it’s been a month,” said Ron.
“Hang on,” said Harry, as another part of last night’s conversation came back to him. “I think Dumbledore said our O.W.L.
results would be arriving today!”
“Today?” shrieked Hermione. “Today? But why didn’t you — oh
my God — you should have said —”
She leapt to her feet.
“I’m going to see whether any owls have come. . . .”
But when Harry arrived downstairs ten minutes later, fully
dressed and carrying his empty breakfast tray, it was to find
Hermione sitting at the kitchen table in great agitation, while Mrs.
Weasley tried to lessen her resemblance to half a panda.
“It just won’t budge,” Mrs. Weasley was saying anxiously, standing over Hermione with her wand in her hand and a copy of The

Healer’s Helpmate open at “Bruises, Cuts, and Abrasions.” “This
has always worked before, I just can’t understand it.”
“It’ll be Fred and George’s idea of a funny joke, making sure it
can’t come off,” said Ginny
“But it’s got to come off!” squeaked Hermione. “I can’t go
around looking like this forever!”
“You won’t, dear, we’ll find an antidote, don’t worry,” said Mrs.
Weasley soothingly.
“Bill told me ’ow Fred and George are very amusing!” said Fleur,
smiling serenely.
“Yes, I can hardly breathe for laughing,” snapped Hermione.
She jumped up and started walking round and round the
kitchen, twisting her fingers together.
“Mrs. Weasley, you’re quite, quite sure no owls have arrived this
morning?”
“Yes, dear, I’d have noticed,” said Mrs. Weasley patiently. “But
it’s barely nine, there’s still plenty of time. . . .”
“I know I messed up Ancient Runes,” muttered Hermione
feverishly, “I definitely made at least one serious mistranslation.
And the Defense Against the Dark Arts practical was no good at all.
I thought Transfiguration went all right at the time, but looking
back —”
“Hermione, will you shut up, you’re not the only one who’s
nervous!” barked Ron. “And when you’ve got your eleven ‘Outstanding’ O.W.L.s . . .”
“Don’t, don’t, don’t!” said Hermione, flapping her hands hysterically. “I know I’ve failed everything!”
“What happens if we fail?” Harry asked the room at large, but it
was again Hermione who answered.

“We discuss our options with our Head of House, I asked Professor McGonagall at the end of last term.”
Harry’s stomach squirmed. He wished he had eaten less
breakfast.
“At Beauxbatons,” said Fleur complacently, “we ’ad a different
way of doing things. I think eet was better. We sat our examinations after six years of study, not five, and then —”
Fleur’s words were drowned in a scream. Hermione was pointing
through the kitchen window. Three black specks were clearly visible in the sky, growing larger all the time.
“They’re definitely owls,” said Ron hoarsely, jumping up to join
Hermione at the window.
“And there are three of them,” said Harry, hastening to her other
side.
“One for each of us,” said Hermione in a terrified whisper. “Oh
no . . . oh no . . . oh no . . .”
She gripped both Harry and Ron tightly around the elbows.
The owls were flying directly at the Burrow, three handsome
tawnies, each of which, it became clear as they flew lower over the
path leading up to the house, was carrying a large square envelope.
“Oh no!” squealed Hermione.
Mrs. Weasley squeezed past them and opened the kitchen window. One, two, three, the owls soared through it and landed on the
table in a neat line. All three of them lifted their right legs.
Harry moved forward. The letter addressed to him was tied to
the leg of the owl in the middle. He untied it with fumbling fingers. To his left, Ron was trying to detach his own results; to his
right, Hermione’s hands were shaking so much she was making her
whole owl tremble.

Nobody in the kitchen spoke. At last, Harry managed to detach
the envelope. He slit it open quickly and unfolded the parchment
inside.

Harry read the parchment through several times, his breathing
becoming easier with each reading. It was all right: He had always
known that he would fail Divination, and he had had no chance of
passing History of Magic, given that he had collapsed halfway
through the examination, but he had passed everything else! He ran
his finger down the grades . . . he had passed well in Transfiguration

AN EXCESS OF PHLEGM
and Herbology, he had even exceeded expectations at Potions! And
best of all, he had achieved “Outstanding” at Defense Against the
Dark Arts!
He looked around. Hermione had her back to him and her head
bent, but Ron was looking delighted.
“Only failed Divination and History of Magic, and who cares
about them?” he said happily to Harry. “Here — swap —”
Harry glanced down Ron’s grades: There were no “Outstandings” there. . . .
“Knew you’d be top at Defense Against the Dark Arts,” said
Ron, punching Harry on the shoulder. “We’ve done all right,
haven’t we?”
“Well done!” said Mrs. Weasley proudly, ruffling Ron’s hair.
“Seven O.W.L.s, that’s more than Fred and George got together!”
“Hermione?” said Ginny tentatively, for Hermione still hadn’t
turned around. “How did you do?”
“I — not bad,” said Hermione in a small voice.
“Oh, come off it,” said Ron, striding over to her and whipping
her results out of her hand. “Yep — nine ‘Outstandings’ and one
‘Exceeds Expectations’ at Defense Against the Dark Arts.” He
looked down at her, half-amused, half-exasperated. “You’re actually
disappointed, aren’t you?”
Hermione shook her head, but Harry laughed.
“Well, we’re N.E.W.T. students now!” grinned Ron. “Mum, are
there any more sausages?”
Harry looked back down at his results. They were as good as he
could have hoped for. He felt just one tiny twinge of regret. . . .
This was the end of his ambition to become an Auror. He had not

secured the required Potions grade. He had known all along that he
wouldn’t, but he still felt a sinking in his stomach as he looked
again at that small black E.
It was odd, really, seeing that it had been a Death Eater in disguise who had first told Harry he would make a good Auror, but
somehow the idea had taken hold of him, and he couldn’t really
think of anything else he would like to be. Moreover, it had seemed
the right destiny for him since he had heard the prophecy a few
weeks ago. . . . Neither can live while the other survives. . . . Wouldn’t
he be living up to the prophecy, and giving himself the best chance
of survival, if he joined those highly trained wizards whose job it
was to find and kill Voldemort?

arry remained within the confines of the Burrow’s garden over the next few weeks. He spent most of his days
playing two-a-side Quidditch in the Weasleys’ orchard (he and
Hermione against Ron and Ginny; Hermione was dreadful and
Ginny good, so they were reasonably well matched) and his evenings eating triple helpings of everything Mrs. Weasley put in front
of him.
It would have been a happy, peaceful holiday had it not been for
the stories of disappearances, odd accidents, even of deaths now
appearing almost daily in the Prophet. Sometimes Bill and Mr.
Weasley brought home news before it even reached the paper. To
Mrs. Weasley’s displeasure, Harry’s sixteenth birthday celebrations
were marred by grisly tidings brought to the party by Remus
Lupin, who was looking gaunt and grim, his brown hair streaked
liberally with gray, his clothes more ragged and patched than ever.
“There have been another couple of dementor attacks,” he


CHAPTER SIX
announced, as Mrs. Weasley passed him a large slice of birthday
cake. “And they’ve found Igor Karkaroff ’s body in a shack up
north. The Dark Mark had been set over it — well, frankly, I’m
surprised he stayed alive for even a year after deserting the Death
Eaters; Sirius’s brother, Regulus, only managed a few days as far as
I can remember.”
“Yes, well,” said Mrs. Weasley, frowning, “perhaps we should
talk about something diff —”
“Did you hear about Florean Fortescue, Remus?” asked Bill,
who was being plied with wine by Fleur. “The man who ran —”
“— the ice-cream place in Diagon Alley?” Harry interrupted,
with an unpleasant, hollow sensation in the pit of his stomach. “He
used to give me free ice creams. What’s happened to him?”
“Dragged off, by the look of his place.”
“Why?” asked Ron, while Mrs. Weasley pointedly glared at Bill.
“Who knows? He must’ve upset them somehow. He was a good
man, Florean.”
“Talking of Diagon Alley,” said Mr. Weasley, “looks like Ollivander’s gone too.”
“The wandmaker?” said Ginny, looking startled.
“That’s the one. Shop’s empty. No sign of a struggle. No one
knows whether he left voluntarily or was kidnapped.”
“But wands — what’ll people do for wands?”
“They’ll make do with other makers,” said Lupin. “But Ollivander was the best, and if the other side have got him it’s not so good
for us.”
The day after this rather gloomy birthday tea, their letters and
booklists arrived from Hogwarts. Harry’s included a surprise: He
had been made Quidditch Captain.

“That gives you equal status with prefects!” cried Hermione
happily. “You can use our special bathroom now and everything!”
“Wow, I remember when Charlie wore one of these,” said Ron,
examining the badge with glee. “Harry, this is so cool, you’re my
Captain — if you let me back on the team, I suppose, ha ha. . . .”
“Well, I don’t suppose we can put off a trip to Diagon Alley
much longer now you’ve got these,” sighed Mrs. Weasley, looking
down Ron’s booklist. “We’ll go on Saturday as long as your father
doesn’t have to go into work again. I’m not going there without
him.”
“Mum, d’you honestly think You-Know-Who’s going to be hiding behind a bookshelf in Flourish and Blotts?” sniggered Ron.
“Fortescue and Ollivander went on holiday, did they?” said Mrs.
Weasley, firing up at once. “If you think security’s a laughing matter you can stay behind and I’ll get your things myself —”
“No, I wanna come, I want to see Fred and George’s shop!” said
Ron hastily.
“Then you just buck up your ideas, young man, before I decide
you’re too immature to come with us!” said Mrs. Weasley angrily,
snatching up her clock, all nine hands of which were still pointing
at “mortal peril,” and balancing it on top of a pile of just-laundered
towels. “And that goes for returning to Hogwarts as well!”
Ron turned to stare incredulously at Harry as his mother hoisted
the laundry basket and the teetering clock into her arms and
stormed out of the room.
“Blimey . . . you can’t even make a joke round here anymore. . . .”
But Ron was careful not to be flippant about Voldemort over the
next few days. Saturday dawned without any more outbursts from
Mrs. Weasley, though she seemed very tense at breakfast. Bill, who


107



CHAPTER SIX
would be staying at home with Fleur (much to Hermione and
Ginny’s pleasure), passed a full money bag across the table to Harry.
“Where’s mine?” demanded Ron at once, his eyes wide.
“That’s already Harry’s, idiot,” said Bill. “I got it out of your
vault for you, Harry, because it’s taking about five hours for the
public to get to their gold at the moment, the goblins have tightened security so much. Two days ago Arkie Philpott had a Probity
Probe stuck up his . . . Well, trust me, this way’s easier.”
“Thanks, Bill,” said Harry, pocketing his gold.
“ ’E is always so thoughtful,” purred Fleur adoringly, stroking
Bill’s nose. Ginny mimed vomiting into her cereal behind Fleur.
Harry choked over his cornflakes, and Ron thumped him on the
back.
It was an overcast, murky day. One of the special Ministry of
Magic cars, in which Harry had ridden once before, was awaiting
them in the front yard when they emerged from the house, pulling
on their cloaks.
“It’s good Dad can get us these again,” said Ron appreciatively,
stretching luxuriously as the car moved smoothly away from the
Burrow, Bill and Fleur waving from the kitchen window. He,
Harry, Hermione, and Ginny were all sitting in roomy comfort in
the wide backseat.
“Don’t get used to it, it’s only because of Harry,” said Mr. Weasley over his shoulder. He and Mrs. Weasley were in front with the
Ministry driver; the front passenger seat had obligingly stretched
into what resembled a two-seater sofa. “He’s been given top-grade
security status. And we’ll be joining up with additional security at
the Leaky Cauldron too.”
Harry said nothing; he did not much fancy doing his shopping


while surrounded by a battalion of Aurors. He had stowed his
Invisibility Cloak in his backpack and felt that, if that was good
enough for Dumbledore, it ought to be good enough for the Ministry, though now he came to think of it, he was not sure the
Ministry knew about his cloak.
“Here you are, then,” said the driver, a surprisingly short while
later, speaking for the first time as he slowed in Charing Cross
Road and stopped outside the Leaky Cauldron. “I’m to wait for
you, any idea how long you’ll be?”
“A couple of hours, I expect,” said Mr. Weasley. “Ah, good, he’s
here!”
Harry imitated Mr. Weasley and peered through the window;
his heart leapt. There were no Aurors waiting outside the inn, but
instead the gigantic, black-bearded form of Rubeus Hagrid, the
Hogwarts gamekeeper, wearing a long beaverskin coat, beaming at
the sight of Harry’s face and oblivious to the startled stares of passing Muggles.
“Harry!” he boomed, sweeping Harry into a bone-crushing hug
the moment Harry had stepped out of the car. “Buckbeak —
Witherwings, I mean — yeh should see him, Harry, he’s so happy
ter be back in the open air —”
“Glad he’s pleased,” said Harry, grinning as he massaged his ribs.
“We didn’t know ‘security’ meant you!”
“I know, jus’ like old times, innit? See, the Ministry wanted ter
send a bunch o’ Aurors, but Dumbledore said I’d do,” said Hagrid
proudly, throwing out his chest and tucking his thumbs into his
pockets. “Let’s get goin’ then — after yeh, Molly, Arthur —”
The Leaky Cauldron was, for the first time in Harry’s memory,
completely empty. Only Tom the landlord, wizened and toothless,


CHAPTER SIX
remained of the old crowd. He looked up hopefully as they entered, but before he could speak, Hagrid said importantly, “Jus’
passin’ through today, Tom, sure yeh understand, Hogwarts business, yeh know.”
Tom nodded gloomily and returned to wiping glasses; Harry,
Hermione, Hagrid, and the Weasleys walked through the bar and
out into the chilly little courtyard at the back where the dustbins
stood. Hagrid raised his pink umbrella and rapped a certain brick
in the wall, which opened at once to form an archway onto a winding cobbled street. They stepped through the entrance and paused,
looking around.
Diagon Alley had changed. The colorful, glittering window displays of spellbooks, potion ingredients, and cauldrons were lost to
view, hidden behind the large Ministry of Magic posters that had
been pasted over them. Most of these somber purple posters carried
blown-up versions of the security advice on the Ministry pamphlets that had been sent out over the summer, but others bore
moving black-and-white photographs of Death Eaters known to be
on the loose. Bellatrix Lestrange was sneering from the front of the
nearest apothecary. A few windows were boarded up, including
those of Florean Fortescue’s Ice Cream Parlor. On the other hand,
a number of shabby-looking stalls had sprung up along the street.
The nearest one, which had been erected outside Flourish and
Blotts, under a striped, stained awning, had a cardboard sign
pinned to its front:

A seedy-looking little wizard was rattling armfuls of silver symbols on chains at passersby.
“One for your little girl, madam?” he called at Mrs. Weasley as
they passed, leering at Ginny. “Protect her pretty neck?”
“If I were on duty . . .” said Mr. Weasley, glaring angrily at the
amulet seller.
“Yes, but don’t go arresting anyone now, dear, we’re in a hurry,”
said Mrs. Weasley, nervously consulting a list. “I think we’d better
do Madam Malkin’s first, Hermione wants new dress robes, and
Ron’s showing much too much ankle in his school robes, and you
must need new ones too, Harry, you’ve grown so much — come
on, everyone —”
“Molly, it doesn’t make sense for all of us to go to Madam Malkin’s,” said Mr. Weasley. “Why don’t those three go with Hagrid,
and we can go to Flourish and Blotts and get everyone’s schoolbooks?”
“I don’t know,” said Mrs. Weasley anxiously, clearly torn between a desire to finish the shopping quickly and the wish to stick
together in a pack. “Hagrid, do you think — ?”
“Don’ fret, they’ll be fine with me, Molly,” said Hagrid soothingly, waving an airy hand the size of a dustbin lid. Mrs. Weasley
did not look entirely convinced, but allowed the separation, scurrying off toward Flourish and Blotts with her husband and Ginny
while Harry, Ron, Hermione, and Hagrid set off for Madam
Malkin’s.
Harry noticed that many of the people who passed them had the
same harried, anxious look as Mrs. Weasley, and that nobody was
stopping to talk anymore; the shoppers stayed together in their



CHAPTER SIX
own tightly knit groups, moving intently about their business. Nobody seemed to be shopping alone.
“Migh’ be a bit of a squeeze in there with all of us,” said Hagrid,
stopping outside Madam Malkin’s and bending down to peer
through the window. “I’ll stand guard outside, all right?”
So Harry, Ron, and Hermione entered the little shop together. It
appeared, at first glance, to be empty, but no sooner had the door
swung shut behind them than they heard a familiar voice issuing
from behind a rack of dress robes in spangled green and blue.
“. . . not a child, in case you haven’t noticed, Mother. I am perfectly capable of doing my shopping alone.”
There was a clucking noise and a voice Harry recognized as that
of Madam Malkin, the owner, said, “Now, dear, your mother’s
quite right, none of us is supposed to go wandering around on our
own anymore, it’s nothing to do with being a child —”
“Watch where you’re sticking that pin, will you!”
A teenage boy with a pale, pointed face and white-blond hair appeared from behind the rack, wearing a handsome set of dark green
robes that glittered with pins around the hem and the edges of the
sleeves. He strode to the mirror and examined himself; it was a few
moments before he noticed Harry, Ron, and Hermione reflected
over his shoulder. His light gray eyes narrowed.
“If you’re wondering what the smell is, Mother, a Mudblood just
walked in,” said Draco Malfoy.
“I don’t think there’s any need for language like that!” said
Madam Malkin, scurrying out from behind the clothes rack holding a tape measure and a wand. “And I don’t want wands drawn in
my shop either!” she added hastily, for a glance toward the door

had shown her Harry and Ron both standing there with their
wands out and pointing at Malfoy. Hermione, who was standing
slightly behind them, whispered, “No, don’t, honestly, it’s not
worth it. . . .”
“Yeah, like you’d dare do magic out of school,” sneered Malfoy.
“Who blacked your eye, Granger? I want to send them flowers.”
“That’s quite enough!” said Madam Malkin sharply, looking
over her shoulder for support. “Madam — please —”
Narcissa Malfoy strolled out from behind the clothes rack.
“Put those away,” she said coldly to Harry and Ron. “If you attack my son again, I shall ensure that it is the last thing you ever
do.”
“Really?” said Harry, taking a step forward and gazing into the
smoothly arrogant face that, for all its pallor, still resembled her sister’s. He was as tall as she was now. “Going to get a few Death Eater
pals to do us in, are you?”
Madam Malkin squealed and clutched at her heart.
“Really, you shouldn’t accuse — dangerous thing to say —
wands away, please!”
But Harry did not lower his wand. Narcissa Malfoy smiled
unpleasantly.
“I see that being Dumbledore’s favorite has given you a false
sense of security, Harry Potter. But Dumbledore won’t always be
there to protect you.”
Harry looked mockingly all around the shop. “Wow . . . look
at that . . . he’s not here now! So why not have a go? They might
be able to find you a double cell in Azkaban with your loser of a
husband!”

Malfoy made an angry movement toward Harry, but stumbled
over his overlong robe. Ron laughed loudly.
“Don’t you dare talk to my mother like that, Potter!” Malfoy
snarled.
“It’s all right, Draco,” said Narcissa, restraining him with her
thin white fingers upon his shoulder. “I expect Potter will be reunited with dear Sirius before I am reunited with Lucius.”
Harry raised his wand higher.
“Harry, no!” moaned Hermione, grabbing his arm and attempting to push it down by his side. “Think. . . . You mustn’t. . . . You’ll
be in such trouble. . . .”
Madam Malkin dithered for a moment on the spot, then seemed
to decide to act as though nothing was happening in the hope
that it wouldn’t. She bent toward Malfoy, who was still glaring at
Harry.
“I think this left sleeve could come up a little bit more, dear, let
me just —”
“Ouch!” bellowed Malfoy, slapping her hand away. “Watch
where you’re putting your pins, woman! Mother — I don’t think I
want these anymore —”
He pulled the robes over his head and threw them onto the floor
at Madam Malkin’s feet.
“You’re right, Draco,” said Narcissa, with a contemptuous
glance at Hermione, “now I know the kind of scum that shops
here. . . . We’ll do better at Twilfitt and Tatting’s.”
And with that, the pair of them strode out of the shop, Malfoy
taking care to bang as hard as he could into Ron on the way out.
“Well, really!” said Madam Malkin, snatching up the fallen robes

and moving the tip of her wand over them like a vacuum cleaner,
so that it removed all the dust.
She was distracted all through the fitting of Ron’s and Harry’s
new robes, tried to sell Hermione wizard’s dress robes instead of
witch’s, and when she finally bowed them out of the shop it was
with an air of being glad to see the back of them.
“Got ev’rything?” asked Hagrid brightly when they reappeared
at his side.
“Just about,” said Harry. “Did you see the Malfoys?”
“Yeah,” said Hagrid, unconcerned. “Bu’ they wouldn’ dare make
trouble in the middle o’ Diagon Alley, Harry. Don’ worry abou’
them.”
Harry, Ron, and Hermione exchanged looks, but before they
could disabuse Hagrid of this comfortable notion, Mr. and Mrs.
Weasley and Ginny appeared, all clutching heavy packages of
books.
“Everyone all right?” said Mrs. Weasley. “Got your robes? Right
then, we can pop in at the Apothecary and Eeylops on the way to
Fred and George’s — stick close, now. . . .”
Neither Harry nor Ron bought any ingredients at the Apothecary, seeing that they were no longer studying Potions, but both
bought large boxes of owl nuts for Hedwig and Pigwidgeon at Eeylops Owl Emporium. Then, with Mrs. Weasley checking her watch
every minute or so, they headed farther along the street in search of
Weasleys’ Wizard Wheezes, the joke shop run by Fred and George.
“We really haven’t got too long,” Mrs. Weasley said. “So we’ll
just have a quick look around and then back to the car. We must be
close, that’s number ninety-two . . . ninety-four . . .”

Set against the dull, poster-muffled shop fronts around them,
Fred and George’s windows hit the eye like a firework display.
Casual passersby were looking back over their shoulders at the windows, and a few rather stunned-looking people had actually come
to a halt, transfixed. The left-hand window was dazzlingly full of an
assortment of goods that revolved, popped, flashed, bounced, and
shrieked; Harry’s eyes began to water just looking at it. The righthand window was covered with a gigantic poster, purple like those
of the Ministry, but emblazoned with flashing yellow letters:

WHY ARE YOU WORRYING ABOUT
YOU-KNOW-WHO?
YOU SHOULD BE WORRYING ABOUT
U-NO-POO —
THE CONSTIPATION SENSATION
THAT’S GRIPPING THE NATION!
Harry started to laugh. He heard a weak sort of moan beside him
and looked around to see Mrs. Weasley gazing, dumbfounded, at the
poster. Her lips moved silently, mouthing the name “U-No-Poo.”
“They’ll be murdered in their beds!” she whispered.
“No they won’t!” said Ron, who, like Harry, was laughing. “This
is brilliant!”
And he and Harry led the way into the shop. It was packed with
customers; Harry could not get near the shelves. He stared around,
looking up at the boxes piled to the ceiling: Here were the Skiving
Snackboxes that the twins had perfected during their last, unfin-

ished year at Hogwarts; Harry noticed that the Nosebleed Nougat
was most popular, with only one battered box left on the shelf.
There were bins full of trick wands, the cheapest merely turning
into rubber chickens or pairs of briefs when waved, the most expensive beating the unwary user around the head and neck, and
boxes of quills, which came in Self-Inking, Spell-Checking, and
Smart-Answer varieties. A space cleared in the crowd, and Harry
pushed his way toward the counter, where a gaggle of delighted
ten-year-olds was watching a tiny little wooden man slowly ascending the steps to a real set of gallows, both perched on a box
that read: reusable hangman — spell it or he’ll swing!
“ ‘Patented Daydream Charms . . .’ ”
Hermione had managed to squeeze through to a large display
near the counter and was reading the information on the back of a
box bearing a highly colored picture of a handsome youth and a
swooning girl who were standing on the deck of a pirate ship.
“ ‘One simple incantation and you will enter a top-quality,
highly realistic, thirty-minute daydream, easy to fit into the average
school lesson and virtually undetectable (side effects include vacant
expression and minor drooling). Not for sale to under-sixteens.’
You know,” said Hermione, looking up at Harry, “that really is extraordinary magic!”
“For that, Hermione,” said a voice behind them, “you can have
one for free.”
A beaming Fred stood before them, wearing a set of magenta
robes that clashed magnificently with his flaming hair.
“How are you, Harry?” They shook hands. “And what’s happened to your eye, Hermione?”

“Your punching telescope,” she said ruefully.
“Oh blimey, I forgot about those,” said Fred. “Here —”
He pulled a tub out of his pocket and handed it to her; she unscrewed it gingerly to reveal a thick yellow paste.
“Just dab it on, that bruise’ll be gone within the hour,” said Fred.
“We had to find a decent bruise remover. “We’re testing most of our
products on ourselves.”
Hermione looked nervous. “It is safe, isn’t it?” she asked.
“ ’Course it is,” said Fred bracingly. “Come on, Harry, I’ll give
you a tour.”
Harry left Hermione dabbing her black eye with paste and followed Fred toward the back of the shop, where he saw a stand of
card and rope tricks.
“Muggle magic tricks!” said Fred happily, pointing them out.
“For freaks like Dad, you know, who love Muggle stuff. It’s not a
big earner, but we do fairly steady business, they’re great novelties.
. . . Oh, here’s George. . . .”
Fred’s twin shook Harry’s hand energetically.
“Giving him the tour? Come through the back, Harry, that’s
where we’re making the real money — pocket anything, you, and
you’ll pay in more than Galleons!” he added warningly to a small boy
who hastily whipped his hand out of the tub labeled edible dark
marks — they’ll make anyone sick!
George pushed back a curtain beside the Muggle tricks and
Harry saw a darker, less crowded room. The packaging on the
products lining these shelves was more subdued.
“We’ve just developed this more serious line,” said Fred. “Funny
how it happened . . .”

“You wouldn’t believe how many people, even people who work
at the Ministry, can’t do a decent Shield Charm,” said George.
“ ’Course, they didn’t have you teaching them, Harry.”
“That’s right. . . . Well, we thought Shield Hats were a bit of a
laugh, you know, challenge your mate to jinx you while wearing it
and watch his face when the jinx just bounces off. But the Ministry
bought five hundred for all its support staff! And we’re still getting
massive orders!”
“So we’ve expanded into a range of Shield Cloaks, Shield
Gloves . . .”
“. . . I mean, they wouldn’t help much against the Unforgivable
Curses, but for minor to moderate hexes or jinxes . . .”
“And then we thought we’d get into the whole area of Defense
Against the Dark Arts, because it’s such a money spinner,” continued George enthusiastically. “This is cool. Look, Instant Darkness
Powder, we’re importing it from Peru. Handy if you want to make
a quick escape.”
“And our Decoy Detonators are just walking off the shelves,
look,” said Fred, pointing at a number of weird-looking black
horn-type objects that were indeed attempting to scurry out of
sight. “You just drop one surreptitiously and it’ll run off and make
a nice loud noise out of sight, giving you a diversion if you need
one.
“Handy,” said Harry, impressed.
“Here,” said George, catching a couple and throwing them to
Harry.
A young witch with short blonde hair poked her head around the
curtain; Harry saw that she too was wearing magenta staff robes.

CHAPTER SIX
“There’s a customer out here looking for a joke cauldron, Mr.
Weasley and Mr. Weasley,” she said.
Harry found it very odd to hear Fred and George called “Mr.
Weasley,” but they took it in their stride.
“Right you are, Verity, I’m coming,” said George promptly.
“Harry, you help yourself to anything you want, all right? No
charge.”
“I can’t do that!” said Harry, who had already pulled out his
money bag to pay for the Decoy Detonators.
“You don’t pay here,” said Fred firmly, waving away Harry’s
gold.
“But —”
“You gave us our start-up loan, we haven’t forgotten,” said
George sternly. “Take whatever you like, and just remember to tell
people where you got it, if they ask.”
George swept off through the curtain to help with the customers, and Fred led Harry back into the main part of the shop to
find Hermione and Ginny still poring over the Patented Daydream
Charms.
“Haven’t you girls found our special WonderWitch products
yet?” asked Fred. “Follow me, ladies. . . .”
Near the window was an array of violently pink products around
which a cluster of excited girls was giggling enthusiastically. Hermione and Ginny both hung back, looking wary.
“There you go,” said Fred proudly. “Best range of love potions
you’ll find anywhere.”
Ginny raised an eyebrow skeptically. “Do they work?” she asked.
“Certainly they work, for up to twenty-four hours at a time depending on the weight of the boy in question —”

“— and the attractiveness of the girl,” said George, reappearing
suddenly at their side. “But we’re not selling them to our sister,” he
added, becoming suddenly stern, “not when she’s already got about
five boys on the go from what we’ve —”
“Whatever you’ve heard from Ron is a big fat lie,” said Ginny
calmly, leaning forward to take a small pink pot off the shelf.
“What’s this?”
“Guaranteed ten-second pimple vanisher,” said Fred. “Excellent
on everything from boils to blackheads, but don’t change the subject. Are you or are you not currently going out with a boy called
Dean Thomas?”
“Yes, I am,” said Ginny. “And last time I looked, he was definitely one boy, not five. What are those?”
She was pointing at a number of round balls of fluff in shades of
pink and purple, all rolling around the bottom of a cage and emitting high-pitched squeaks.
“Pygmy Puffs,” said George. “Miniature puffskeins, we can’t
breed them fast enough. So what about Michael Corner?”
“I dumped him, he was a bad loser,” said Ginny, putting a finger
through the bars of the cage and watching the Pygmy Puffs crowd
around it. “They’re really cute!”
“They’re fairly cuddly, yes,” conceded Fred. “But you’re moving
through boyfriends a bit fast, aren’t you?”
Ginny turned to look at him, her hands on her hips. There was
such a Mrs. Weasley-ish glare on her face that Harry was surprised
Fred didn’t recoil.
“It’s none of your business. And I’ll thank you,” she added angrily to Ron, who had just appeared at George’s elbow, laden with
merchandise, “not to tell tales about me to these two!”

“That’s three Galleons, nine Sickles, and a Knut,” said Fred, examining the many boxes in Ron’s arms. “Cough up.”
“I’m your brother!”
“And that’s our stuff you’re nicking. Three Galleons, nine Sickles. I’ll knock off the Knut.”
“But I haven’t got three Galleons, nine Sickles!”
“You’d better put it back then, and mind you put it on the right
shelves.”
Ron dropped several boxes, swore, and made a rude hand gesture at Fred that was unfortunately spotted by Mrs. Weasley, who
had chosen that moment to appear.
“If I see you do that again I’ll jinx your fingers together,” she said
sharply.
“Mum, can I have a Pygmy Puff?” said Ginny at once.
“A what?” said Mrs. Weasley warily.
“Look, they’re so sweet. . . .”
Mrs. Weasley moved aside to look at the Pygmy Puffs, and
Harry, Ron, and Hermione momentarily had an unimpeded view
out of the window. Draco Malfoy was hurrying up the street alone.
As he passed Weasleys’ Wizard Wheezes, he glanced over his shoulder. Seconds later, he moved beyond the scope of the window and
they lost sight of him.
“Wonder where his mummy is?” said Harry, frowning.
“Given her the slip by the looks of it,” said Ron.
“Why, though?” said Hermione.
Harry said nothing; he was thinking too hard. Narcissa Malfoy
would not have let her precious son out of her sight willingly; Malfoy must have made a real effort to free himself from her clutches.



DRACO’S DETOUR
Harry, knowing and loathing Malfoy, was sure the reason could not
be innocent.
He glanced around. Mrs. Weasley and Ginny were bending over
the Pygmy Puffs. Mr. Weasley was delightedly examining a pack of
Muggle marked playing cards. Fred and George were both helping
customers. On the other side of the glass, Hagrid was standing
with his back to them, looking up and down the street.
“Get under here, quick,” said Harry, pulling his Invisibility
Cloak out of his bag.
“Oh — I don’t know, Harry,” said Hermione, looking uncertainly toward Mrs. Weasley.
“Come on!” said Ron.
She hesitated for a second longer, then ducked under the cloak
with Harry and Ron. Nobody noticed them vanish; they were all
too interested in Fred and George’s products. Harry, Ron, and Hermione squeezed their way out of the door as quickly as they could,
but by the time they gained the street, Malfoy had disappeared just
as successfully as they had.
“He was going in that direction,” murmured Harry as quietly as
possible, so that the humming Hagrid would not hear them.
“C’mon.”
They scurried along, peering left and right, through shop windows and doors, until Hermione pointed ahead.
“That’s him, isn’t it?” she whispered. “Turning left?”
“Big surprise,” whispered Ron.
For Malfoy had glanced around, then slid into Knockturn Alley
and out of sight.
“Quick, or we’ll lose him,” said Harry, speeding up.

CHAPTER SIX
“Our feet’ll be seen!” said Hermione anxiously, as the cloak
flapped a little around their ankles; it was much more difficult hiding all three of them under the cloak nowadays.
“It doesn’t matter,” said Harry impatiently. “Just hurry!”
But Knockturn Alley, the side street devoted to the Dark Arts,
looked completely deserted. They peered into windows as they
passed, but none of the shops seemed to have any customers at all.
Harry supposed it was a bit of a giveaway in these dangerous and
suspicious times to buy Dark artifacts — or at least, to be seen buying them.
Hermione gave his arm a hard pinch.
“Ouch!”
“Shh! Look! He’s in there!” she breathed in Harry’s ear.
They had drawn level with the only shop in Knockturn Alley
that Harry had ever visited, Borgin and Burkes, which sold a wide
variety of sinister objects. There in the midst of the cases full of
skulls and old bottles stood Draco Malfoy with his back to them,
just visible beyond the very same large black cabinet in which
Harry had once hidden to avoid Malfoy and his father. Judging by
the movements of Malfoy’s hands, he was talking animatedly. The
proprietor of the shop, Mr. Borgin, an oily-haired, stooping man,
stood facing Malfoy. He was wearing a curious expression of mingled resentment and fear.
“If only we could hear what they’re saying!” said Hermione.
“We can!” said Ron excitedly. “Hang on — damn —”
He dropped a couple more of the boxes he was still clutching as
he fumbled with the largest.
“Extendable Ears, look!”
“Fantastic!” said Hermione, as Ron unraveled the long, flesh

colored strings and began to feed them toward the bottom of the
door. “Oh, I hope the door isn’t Imperturbable —”
“No!” said Ron gleefully. “Listen!”
They put their heads together and listened intently to the ends
of the strings, through which Malfoy’s voice could be heard loud
and clear, as though a radio had been turned on.
“. . . you know how to fix it?”
“Possibly,” said Borgin, in a tone that suggested he was unwilling to commit himself. “I’ll need to see it, though. Why don’t you
bring it into the shop?”
“I can’t,” said Malfoy. “It’s got to stay put. I just need you to tell
me how to do it.”
Harry saw Borgin lick his lips nervously.
“Well, without seeing it, I must say it will be a very difficult job,
perhaps impossible. I couldn’t guarantee anything.”
“No?” said Malfoy, and Harry knew, just by his tone, that Malfoy was sneering. “Perhaps this will make you more confident.”
He moved toward Borgin and was blocked from view by the
cabinet. Harry, Ron, and Hermione shuffled sideways to try and
keep him in sight, but all they could see was Borgin, looking very
frightened.
“Tell anyone,” said Malfoy, “and there will be retribution. You
know Fenrir Greyback? He’s a family friend. He’ll be dropping in
from time to time to make sure you’re giving the problem your full
attention.”
“There will be no need for —”
“I’ll decide that,” said Malfoy. “Well, I’d better be off. And don’t
forget to keep that one safe, I’ll need it.”
“Perhaps you’d like to take it now?”

CHAPTER SIX
“No, of course I wouldn’t, you stupid little man, how would I
look carrying that down the street? Just don’t sell it.”
“Of course not . . . sir.”
Borgin made a bow as deep as the one Harry had once seen him
give Lucius Malfoy.
“Not a word to anyone, Borgin, and that includes my mother,
understand?”
“Naturally, naturally,” murmured Borgin, bowing again.
Next moment, the bell over the door tinkled loudly as Malfoy
stalked out of the shop looking very pleased with himself. He
passed so close to Harry, Ron, and Hermione that they felt the
cloak flutter around their knees again. Inside the shop, Borgin
remained frozen; his unctuous smile had vanished; he looked
worried.
“What was that about?” whispered Ron, reeling in the Extendable Ears.
“Dunno,” said Harry, thinking hard. “He wants something
mended . . . and he wants to reserve something in there. . . . Could
you see what he pointed at when he said ‘that one’?”
“No, he was behind that cabinet —”
“You two stay here,” whispered Hermione.
“What are you — ?”
But Hermione had already ducked out from under the cloak.
She checked her hair in the reflection in the glass, then marched
into the shop, setting the bell tinkling again. Ron hastily fed the
Extendable Ears back under the door and passed one of the strings
to Harry.
“Hello, horrible morning, isn’t it?” Hermione said brightly to
Borgin, who did not answer, but cast her a suspicious look. Hum

ming cheerily, Hermione strolled through the jumble of objects on
display.
“Is this necklace for sale?” she asked, pausing beside a glassfronted case.
“If you’ve got one and a half thousand Galleons,” said Mr.
Borgin coldly.
“Oh — er — no, I haven’t got quite that much,” said Hermione, walking on. “And . . . what about this lovely — um — skull?”
“Sixteen Galleons.”
“So it’s for sale, then? It isn’t being . . . kept for anyone?”
Mr. Borgin squinted at her. Harry had the nasty feeling he knew
exactly what Hermione was up to. Apparently Hermione felt she
had been rumbled too because she suddenly threw caution to the
winds.
“The thing is, that — er — boy who was in here just now,
Draco Malfoy, well, he’s a friend of mine, and I want to get him a
birthday present, but if he’s already reserved anything, I obviously
don’t want to get him the same thing, so . . . um . . .”
It was a pretty lame story in Harry’s opinion, and apparently
Borgin thought so too.
“Out,” he said sharply. “Get out!”
Hermione did not wait to be asked twice, but hurried to the
door with Borgin at her heels. As the bell tinkled again, Borgin
slammed the door behind her and put up the closed sign.
“Ah well,” said Ron, throwing the cloak back over Hermione.
“Worth a try, but you were a bit obvious —”
“Well, next time you can show me how it’s done, Master of
Mystery!” she snapped.
Ron and Hermione bickered all the way back to Weasleys’

joined in with the other two when they insisted, in answer to Mrs.

along, and that she could not have looked properly.

arry spent a lot of the last week of the holidays pondering the meaning of Malfoy’s behavior in Knockturn
Alley. What disturbed him most was the satisfied look on Malfoy’s
face as he had left the shop. Nothing that made Malfoy look that
happy could be good news. To his slight annoyance, however, neither Ron nor Hermione seemed quite as curious about Malfoy’s
activities as he was; or at least, they seemed to get bored of discussing it after a few days.
“Yes, I’ve already agreed it was fishy, Harry,” said Hermione a little impatiently. She was sitting on the windowsill in Fred and
George’s room with her feet up on one of the cardboard boxes and
had only grudgingly looked up from her new copy of Advanced
Rune Translation. “But haven’t we agreed there could be a lot of
explanations?”
“Maybe he’s broken his Hand of Glory,” said Ron vaguely, as he



CHAPTER SEVEN
attempted to straighten his broomstick’s bent tail twigs. “Remember that shriveled-up arm Malfoy had?”
“But what about when he said, ‘Don’t forget to keep that one
safe’?” asked Harry for the umpteenth time. “That sounded to me
like Borgin’s got another one of the broken objects, and Malfoy
wants both.”
“You reckon?” said Ron, now trying to scrape some dirt off his
broom handle.
“Yeah, I do,” said Harry. When neither Ron nor Hermione answered, he said, “Malfoy’s father’s in Azkaban. Don’t you think
Malfoy’d like revenge?”
Ron looked up, blinking.
“Malfoy, revenge? What can he do about it?”
“That’s my point, I don’t know!” said Harry, frustrated. “But he’s
up to something and I think we should take it seriously. His father’s
a Death Eater and —”
Harry broke off, his eyes fixed on the window behind Hermione, his mouth open. A startling thought had just occurred to him.
“Harry?” said Hermione in an anxious voice. “What’s wrong?”
“Your scar’s not hurting again, is it?” asked Ron nervously.
“He’s a Death Eater,” said Harry slowly. “He’s replaced his father
as a Death Eater!”
There was a silence; then Ron erupted in laughter. “Malfoy? He’s
sixteen, Harry! You think You-Know-Who would let Malfoy join?”
“It seems very unlikely, Harry,” said Hermione in a repressive
sort of voice. “What makes you think — ?”
“In Madam Malkin’s. She didn’t touch him, but he yelled and
jerked his arm away from her when she went to roll up his sleeve.
It was his left arm. He’s been branded with the Dark Mark.”

Ron and Hermione looked at each other.
“Well . . .” said Ron, sounding thoroughly unconvinced.
“I think he just wanted to get out of there, Harry,” said Hermione.
“He showed Borgin something we couldn’t see,” Harry pressed
on stubbornly. “Something that seriously scared Borgin. It was the
Mark, I know it — he was showing Borgin who he was dealing
with, you saw how seriously Borgin took him!”
Ron and Hermione exchanged another look.
“I’m not sure, Harry. . . .”
“Yeah, I still don’t reckon You-Know-Who would let Malfoy
join. . . .”
Annoyed, but absolutely convinced he was right, Harry snatched
up a pile of filthy Quidditch robes and left the room; Mrs. Weasley
had been urging them for days not to leave their washing and packing until the last moment. On the landing he bumped into Ginny,
who was returning to her room carrying a pile of freshly laundered
clothes.
“I wouldn’t go in the kitchen just now,” she warned him.
“There’s a lot of Phlegm around.”
“I’ll be careful not to slip in it.” Harry smiled.
Sure enough, when he entered the kitchen it was to find Fleur
sitting at the kitchen table, in full flow about plans for her wedding
to Bill, while Mrs. Weasley kept watch over a pile of self-peeling
sprouts, looking bad-tempered.
“. . . Bill and I ’ave almost decided on only two bridesmaids,

of dressing zem in pale gold — pink would of course be ’orrible

“Ah, Harry!” said Mrs. Weasley loudly, cutting across Fleur’s
monologue. “Good, I wanted to explain about the security arrangements for the journey to Hogwarts tomorrow. We’ve got Ministry
cars again, and there will be Aurors waiting at the station —”
“Is Tonks going to be there?” asked Harry, handing over his
Quidditch things.
“No, I don’t think so, she’s been stationed somewhere else from
what Arthur said.”
“She has let ’erself go, zat Tonks,” Fleur mused, examining her
own stunning reflection in the back of a teaspoon. “A big mistake
if you ask —”
“Yes, thank you,” said Mrs. Weasley tartly, cutting across Fleur
again. “You’d better get on, Harry, I want the trunks ready tonight,
if possible, so we don’t have the usual last-minute scramble.”
And in fact, their departure the following morning was smoother
than usual. The Ministry cars glided up to the front of the Burrow
to find them waiting, trunks packed; Hermione’s cat, Crookshanks,
safely enclosed in his traveling basket; and Hedwig; Ron’s owl, Pigwidgeon; and Ginny’s new purple Pygmy Puff, Arnold, in cages.
“Au revoir, ’Arry,” said Fleur throatily, kissing him good-bye.
Ron hurried forward, looking hopeful, but Ginny stuck out her
foot and Ron fell, sprawling in the dust at Fleur’s feet. Furious, redfaced, and dirt-spattered, he hurried into the car without saying
good-bye.
There was no cheerful Hagrid waiting for them at King’s Cross
Station. Instead, two grim-faced, bearded Aurors in dark Muggle
suits moved forward the moment the cars stopped and, flanking
the party, marched them into the station without speaking.
“Quick, quick, through the barrier,” said Mrs. Weasley, who


THE SLUG CLUB
seemed a little flustered by this austere efficiency. “Harry had better go first, with —”
She looked inquiringly at one of the Aurors, who nodded briefly,
seized Harry’s upper arm, and attempted to steer him toward the
barrier between platforms nine and ten.
“I can walk, thanks,” said Harry irritably, jerking his arm out of
the Auror’s grip. He pushed his trolley directly at the solid barrier,
ignoring his silent companion, and found himself, a second later,
standing on platform nine and three-quarters, where the scarlet
Hogwarts Express stood belching steam over the crowd.
Hermione and the Weasleys joined him within seconds. Without waiting to consult his grim-faced Auror, Harry motioned to
Ron and Hermione to follow him up the platform, looking for an
empty compartment.
“We can’t, Harry,” said Hermione, looking apologetic. “Ron and
I’ve got to go to the prefects’ carriage first and then patrol the corridors for a bit.”
“Oh yeah, I forgot,” said Harry.
“You’d better get straight on the train, all of you, you’ve only got
a few minutes to go,” said Mrs. Weasley, consulting her watch.
“Well, have a lovely term, Ron. . . .”
“Mr. Weasley, can I have a quick word?” said Harry, making up
his mind on the spur of the moment.
“Of course,” said Mr. Weasley, who looked slightly surprised,
but followed Harry out of earshot of the others nevertheless.
Harry had thought it through carefully and come to the conclusion that, if he was to tell anyone, Mr. Weasley was the right person; firstly, because he worked at the Ministry and was therefore in
the best position to make further investigations, and secondly,


133



CHAPTER SEVEN
because he thought that there was not too much risk of Mr.
Weasley exploding with anger.
He could see Mrs. Weasley and the grim-faced Auror casting the
pair of them suspicious looks as they moved away.
“When we were in Diagon Alley,” Harry began, but Mr. Weasley
forestalled him with a grimace.
“Am I about to discover where you, Ron, and Hermione disappeared to while you were supposed to be in the back room of Fred
and George’s shop?”
“How did you — ?”
“Harry, please. You’re talking to the man who raised Fred and
George.”
“Er . . . yeah, all right, we weren’t in the back room.”
“Very well, then, let’s hear the worst.”
“Well, we followed Draco Malfoy. We used my Invisibility
Cloak.”
“Did you have any particular reason for doing so, or was it a
mere whim?”
“Because I thought Malfoy was up to something,” said Harry, disregarding Mr. Weasley’s look of mingled exasperation and amusement. “He’d given his mother the slip and I wanted to know why.”
“Of course you did,” said Mr. Weasley, sounding resigned.
“Well? Did you find out why?”
“He went into Borgin and Burkes,” said Harry, “and started bullying the bloke in there, Borgin, to help him fix something. And he
said he wanted Borgin to keep something else for him. He made it
sound like it was the same kind of thing that needed fixing. Like
they were a pair. And . . .”
Harry took a deep breath.

“There’s something else. We saw Malfoy jump about a mile
when Madam Malkin tried to touch his left arm. I think he’s been
branded with the Dark Mark. I think he’s replaced his father as a
Death Eater.”
Mr. Weasley looked taken aback. After a moment he said,
“Harry, I doubt whether You-Know-Who would allow a sixteenyear-old —”
“Does anyone really know what You-Know-Who would or
wouldn’t do?” asked Harry angrily. “Mr. Weasley, I’m sorry, but
isn’t it worth investigating? If Malfoy wants something fixing, and
he needs to threaten Borgin to get it done, it’s probably something
Dark or dangerous, isn’t it?”
“I doubt it, to be honest, Harry,” said Mr. Weasley slowly. “You
see, when Lucius Malfoy was arrested, we raided his house. We
took away everything that might have been dangerous.”
“I think you missed something,” said Harry stubbornly.
“Well, maybe,” said Mr. Weasley, but Harry could tell that Mr.
Weasley was humoring him.
There was a whistle behind them; nearly everyone had boarded
the train and the doors were closing.
“You’d better hurry,” said Mr. Weasley, as Mrs. Weasley cried,
“Harry, quickly!”
He hurried forward and Mr. and Mrs. Weasley helped him load
his trunk onto the train.
“Now, dear, you’re coming to us for Christmas, it’s all fixed with
Dumbledore, so we’ll see you quite soon,” said Mrs. Weasley
through the window, as Harry slammed the door shut behind him
and the train began to move. “You make sure you look after yourself and —”

The train was gathering speed.
“— be good and —”
She was jogging to keep up now.
“— stay safe!”
Harry waved until the train had turned a corner and Mr. and
Mrs. Weasley were lost to view, then turned to see where the others
had got to. He supposed Ron and Hermione were cloistered in the
prefects’ carriage, but Ginny was a little way along the corridor,
chatting to some friends. He made his way toward her, dragging his
trunk.
People stared shamelessly as he approached. They even pressed
their faces against the windows of their compartments to get a look
at him. He had expected an upswing in the amount of gaping and
gawping he would have to endure this term after all the “Chosen
One” rumors in the Daily Prophet, but he did not enjoy the sensation of standing in a very bright spotlight. He tapped Ginny on the
shoulder.
“Fancy trying to find a compartment?”
“I can’t, Harry, I said I’d meet Dean,” said Ginny brightly. “See
you later.”
“Right,” said Harry. He felt a strange twinge of annoyance as she
walked away, her long red hair dancing behind her; he had become
so used to her presence over the summer that he had almost
forgotten that Ginny did not hang around with him, Ron, and
Hermione while at school. Then he blinked and looked around:
He was surrounded by mesmerized girls.
“Hi, Harry!” said a familiar voice from behind him.
“Neville!” said Harry in relief, turning to see a round-faced boy
struggling toward him.

“Hello, Harry,” said a girl with long hair and large misty eyes,
who was just behind Neville.
“Luna, hi, how are you?”
“Very well, thank you,” said Luna. She was clutching a magazine
to her chest; large letters on the front announced that there was a
pair of free Spectrespecs inside.
“Quibbler still going strong, then?” asked Harry, who felt a certain fondness for the magazine, having given it an exclusive interview the previous year.
“Oh yes, circulation’s well up,” said Luna happily.
“Let’s find seats,” said Harry, and the three of them set off along
the train through hordes of silently staring students. At last they
found an empty compartment, and Harry hurried inside gratefully.
“They’re even staring at us!” said Neville, indicating himself and
Luna. “Because we’re with you!”
“They’re staring at you because you were at the Ministry too,”
said Harry, as he hoisted his trunk into the luggage rack. “Our
little adventure there was all over the Daily Prophet, you must’ve
seen it.”
“Yes, I thought Gran would be angry about all the publicity,”
said Neville, “but she was really pleased. Says I’m starting to live up
to my dad at long last. She bought me a new wand, look!”
He pulled it out and showed it to Harry.
“Cherry and unicorn hair,” he said proudly. “We think it was
one of the last Ollivander ever sold, he vanished next day — oi,
come back here, Trevor!”
And he dived under the seat to retrieve his toad as it made one of
its frequent bids for freedom.
“Are we still doing D.A. meetings this year, Harry?” asked Luna,


137

CHAPTER SEVEN
who was detaching a pair of psychedelic spectacles from the middle
of The Quibbler.
“No point now we’ve got rid of Umbridge, is there?” said Harry,
sitting down. Neville bumped his head against the seat as he
emerged from under it. He looked most disappointed.
“I liked the D.A.! I learned loads with you!”
“I enjoyed the meetings too,” said Luna serenely. “It was like
having friends.”
This was one of those uncomfortable things Luna often said and
which made Harry feel a squirming mixture of pity and embarrassment. Before he could respond, however, there was a disturbance
outside their compartment door; a group of fourth-year girls was
whispering and giggling together on the other side of the glass.
“You ask him!”
“No, you!”
“I’ll do it!”
And one of them, a bold-looking girl with large dark eyes, a
prominent chin, and long black hair pushed her way through the
door.
“Hi, Harry, I’m Romilda, Romilda Vane,” she said loudly and
confidently. “Why don’t you join us in our compartment? You
don’t have to sit with them,” she added in a stage whisper, indicating Neville’s bottom, which was sticking out from under the seat
again as he groped around for Trevor, and Luna, who was now
wearing her free Spectrespecs, which gave her the look of a demented, multicolored owl.
“They’re friends of mine,” said Harry coldly.
“Oh,” said the girl, looking very surprised. “Oh. Okay.”
And she withdrew, sliding the door closed behind her.

“People expect you to have cooler friends than us,” said Luna,
once again displaying her knack for embarrassing honesty.
“You are cool,” said Harry shortly. “None of them was at the
Ministry. They didn’t fight with me.”
“That’s a very nice thing to say,” beamed Luna. Then she pushed
her Spectrespecs farther up her nose and settled down to read The
Quibbler.
“We didn’t face him, though,” said Neville, emerging from under the seat with fluff and dust in his hair and a resigned-looking
Trevor in his hand. “You did. You should hear my gran talk about
you. ‘That Harry Potter’s got more backbone than the whole Ministry
of Magic put together!’ She’d give anything to have you as a grandson. . . .”
Harry laughed uncomfortably and changed the subject to
O.W.L. results as soon as he could. While Neville recited his grades
and wondered aloud whether he would be allowed to take a Transfiguration N.E.W.T. with only an “Acceptable,” Harry watched him
without really listening.
Neville’s childhood had been blighted by Voldemort just as
much as Harry’s had, but Neville had no idea how close he had
come to having Harry’s destiny. The prophecy could have referred
to either of them, yet, for his own inscrutable reasons, Voldemort
had chosen to believe that Harry was the one meant.
Had Voldemort chosen Neville, it would be Neville sitting opposite Harry bearing the lightning-shaped scar and the weight of
the prophecy. . . . Or would it? Would Neville’s mother have died
to save him, as Lily had died for Harry? Surely she would. . . . But
what if she had been unable to stand between her son and Voldemort? Would there then have been no “Chosen One” at all? An


empty seat where Neville now sat and a scarless Harry who would
have been kissed good-bye by his own mother, not Ron’s?
“You all right, Harry? You look funny,” said Neville.
Harry started. “Sorry — I —”
“Wrackspurt got you?” asked Luna sympathetically, peering at
Harry through her enormous colored spectacles.
“I — what?”
“A Wrackspurt . . . They’re invisible. They float in through your
ears and make your brain go fuzzy,” she said. “I thought I felt one
zooming around in here.”
She flapped her hands at thin air, as though beating off large
invisible moths. Harry and Neville caught each other’s eyes and
hastily began to talk of Quidditch.
The weather beyond the train windows was as patchy as it had
been all summer; they passed through stretches of the chilling mist,
then out into weak, clear sunlight. It was during one of the clear
spells, when the sun was visible almost directly overhead, that Ron
and Hermione entered the compartment at last.
“Wish the lunch trolley would hurry up, I’m starving,” said Ron
longingly, slumping into the seat beside Harry and rubbing his
stomach. “Hi, Neville. Hi, Luna. Guess what?” he added, turning
to Harry. “Malfoy’s not doing prefect duty. He’s just sitting in his
compartment with the other Slytherins, we saw him when we
passed.”
Harry sat up straight, interested. It was not like Malfoy to pass
up the chance to demonstrate his power as prefect, which he had
happily abused all the previous year.
“What did he do when he saw you?”
“The usual,” said Ron indifferently, demonstrating a rude hand

140



THE SLUG CLUB
gesture. “Not like him, though, is it? Well — that is” — he did the
hand gesture again — “but why isn’t he out there bullying first
years?
“Dunno,” said Harry, but his mind was racing. Didn’t this look
as though Malfoy had more important things on his mind than
bullying younger students?
“Maybe he preferred the Inquisitorial Squad,” said Hermione.
“Maybe being a prefect seems a bit tame after that.”
“I don’t think so,” said Harry. “I think he’s —”
But before he could expound on his theory, the compartment
door slid open again and a breathless third-year girl stepped inside.
“I’m supposed to deliver these to Neville Longbottom and Harry
P-Potter,” she faltered, as her eyes met Harry’s and she turned scarlet. She was holding out two scrolls of parchment tied with violet
ribbon. Perplexed, Harry and Neville took the scroll addressed to
each of them and the girl stumbled back out of the compartment.
“What is it?” Ron demanded, as Harry unrolled his.
“An invitation,” said Harry.
Harry,
I would be delighted if you would join me for a bite of
lunch in compartment C.
Sincerely,

Professor H. E. F. Slughorn

“Who’s Professor Slughorn?” asked Neville, looking perplexedly
at his own invitation.
“New teacher,” said Harry. “Well, I suppose we’ll have to go,
won’t we?”


141



CHAPTER SEVEN
“But what does he want me for?” asked Neville nervously, as
though he was expecting detention.
“No idea,” said Harry, which was not entirely true, though he
had no proof yet that his hunch was correct. “Listen,” he added,
seized by a sudden brain wave, “let’s go under the Invisibility
Cloak, then we might get a good look at Malfoy on the way, see
what he’s up to.”
This idea, however, came to nothing: The corridors, which were
packed with people on the lookout for the lunch trolley, were impossible to negotiate while wearing the cloak. Harry stowed it regretfully back in his bag, reflecting that it would have been nice to
wear it just to avoid all the staring, which seemed to have increased
in intensity even since he had last walked down the train. Every
now and then, students would hurtle out of their compartments
to get a better look at him. The exception was Cho Chang, who
darted into her compartment when she saw Harry coming. As
Harry passed the window, he saw her deep in determined conversation with her friend Marietta, who was wearing a very thick layer
of makeup that did not entirely obscure the odd formation of pimples still etched across her face. Smirking slightly, Harry pushed on.
When they reached compartment C, they saw at once that
they were not Slughorn’s only invitees, although judging by the
enthusiasm of Slughorn’s welcome, Harry was the most warmly
anticipated.
“Harry, m’boy!” said Slughorn, jumping up at the sight of him
so that his great velvet-covered belly seemed to fill all the remaining space in the compartment. His shiny bald head and great silvery mustache gleamed as brightly in the sunlight as the golden

buttons on his waistcoat. “Good to see you, good to see you! And
you must be Mr. Longbottom!”
Neville nodded, looking scared. At a gesture from Slughorn,
they sat down opposite each other in the only two empty seats,
which were nearest the door. Harry glanced around at their fellow
guests. He recognized a Slytherin from their year, a tall black boy
with high cheekbones and long, slanting eyes; there were also two
seventh-year boys Harry did not know and, squashed in the corner
beside Slughorn and looking as though she was not entirely sure
how she had got there, Ginny.
“Now, do you know everyone?” Slughorn asked Harry and
Neville. “Blaise Zabini is in your year, of course —”
Zabini did not make any sign of recognition or greeting, nor did
Harry or Neville: Gryffindor and Slytherin students loathed each
other on principle.
“This is Cormac McLaggen, perhaps you’ve come across each
other — ? No?”
McLaggen, a large, wiry-haired youth, raised a hand, and Harry
and Neville nodded back at him.
“— and this is Marcus Belby, I don’t know whether — ?”
Belby, who was thin and nervous-looking, gave a strained smile.
“— and this charming young lady tells me she knows you!”
Slughorn finished.
Ginny grimaced at Harry and Neville from behind Slughorn’s
back.
“Well now, this is most pleasant,” said Slughorn cozily. “A
chance to get to know you all a little better. Here, take a napkin.
I’ve packed my own lunch; the trolley, as I remember it, is heavy on



143

CHAPTER SEVEN
licorice wands, and a poor old man’s digestive system isn’t quite up
to such things. . . . Pheasant, Belby?”
Belby started and accepted what looked like half a cold pheasant.
“I was just telling young Marcus here that I had the pleasure of
teaching his Uncle Damocles,” Slughorn told Harry and Neville,
now passing around a basket of rolls. “Outstanding wizard, outstanding, and his Order of Merlin most well-deserved. Do you see
much of your uncle, Marcus?”
Unfortunately, Belby had just taken a large mouthful of pheasant; in his haste to answer Slughorn he swallowed too fast, turned
purple, and began to choke.
“Anapneo,” said Slughorn calmly, pointing his wand at Belby,
whose airway seemed to clear at once.
“Not . . . not much of him, no,” gasped Belby, his eyes streaming.
“Well, of course, I daresay he’s busy,” said Slughorn, looking
questioningly at Belby. “I doubt he invented the Wolfsbane Potion
without considerable hard work!”
“I suppose . . .” said Belby, who seemed afraid to take another
bite of pheasant until he was sure that Slughorn had finished with
him. “Er . . . he and my dad don’t get on very well, you see, so I
don’t really know much about . . .”
His voice tailed away as Slughorn gave him a cold smile and
turned to McLaggen instead.
“Now, you, Cormac,” said Slughorn, “I happen to know you see
a lot of your Uncle Tiberius, because he has a rather splendid picture of the two of you hunting nogtails in, I think, Norfolk?”
“Oh, yeah, that was fun, that was,” said McLaggen. “We went
with Bertie Higgs and Rufus Scrimgeour — this was before he became Minister, obviously —”


144



THE SLUG CLUB
“Ah, you know Bertie and Rufus too?” beamed Slughorn, now
offering around a small tray of pies; somehow, Belby was missed
out. “Now tell me . . .”
It was as Harry had suspected. Everyone here seemed to have
been invited because they were connected to somebody wellknown or influential — everyone except Ginny. Zabini, who was
interrogated after McLaggen, turned out to have a famously beautiful witch for a mother (from what Harry could make out, she
had been married seven times, each of her husbands dying mysteriously and leaving her mounds of gold). It was Neville’s turn next:
This was a very uncomfortable ten minutes, for Neville’s parents,
well-known Aurors, had been tortured into insanity by Bellatrix
Lestrange and a couple of Death Eater cronies. At the end of
Neville’s interview, Harry had the impression that Slughorn was
reserving judgment on Neville, yet to see whether he had any of his
parents’ flair.
“And now,” said Slughorn, shifting massively in his seat with the
air of a compere introducing his star act. “Harry Potter! Where to
begin? I feel I barely scratched the surface when we met over the
summer!” He contemplated Harry for a moment as though he was
a particularly large and succulent piece of pheasant, then said,
“ ‘The Chosen One,’ they’re calling you now!”
Harry said nothing. Belby, McLaggen, and Zabini were all staring at him.
“Of course,” said Slughorn, watching Harry closely, “there have
been rumors for years. . . . I remember when — well — after that
terrible night — Lily — James — and you survived — and the
word was that you must have powers beyond the ordinary —”
Zabini gave a tiny little cough that was clearly supposed to


145



CHAPTER SEVEN
indicate amused skepticism. An angry voice burst out from behind
Slughorn.
“Yeah, Zabini, because you’re so talented . . . at posing. . . .”
“Oh dear!” chuckled Slughorn comfortably, looking around at
Ginny, who was glaring at Zabini around Slughorn’s great belly.
“You want to be careful, Blaise! I saw this young lady perform the
most marvelous Bat-Bogey Hex as I was passing her carriage! I
wouldn’t cross her!”
Zabini merely looked contemptuous.
“Anyway,” said Slughorn, turning back to Harry. “Such rumors
this summer. Of course, one doesn’t know what to believe, the
Prophet has been known to print inaccuracies, make mistakes —
but there seems little doubt, given the number of witnesses, that
there was quite a disturbance at the Ministry and that you were
there in the thick of it all!”
Harry, who could not see any way out of this without flatly
lying, nodded but still said nothing. Slughorn beamed at him.
“So modest, so modest, no wonder Dumbledore is so fond —
you were there, then? But the rest of the stories — so sensational, of
course, one doesn’t know quite what to believe — this fabled
prophecy, for instance —”
“We never heard a prophecy,” said Neville, turning geranium
pink as he said it.
“That’s right,” said Ginny staunchly. “Neville and I were both
there too, and all this ‘Chosen One’ rubbish is just the Prophet
making things up as usual.”
“You were both there too, were you?” said Slughorn with great
interest, looking from Ginny to Neville, but both of them sat clamlike before his encouraging smile.


146

THE SLUG CLUB
“Yes . . . well . . . it is true that the Prophet often exaggerates, of
course. . . .” Slughorn said, sounding a little disappointed. “I remember dear Gwenog telling me (Gwenog Jones, I mean, of
course, Captain of the Holyhead Harpies) —”
He meandered off into a long-winded reminiscence, but Harry
had the distinct impression that Slughorn had not finished with
him, and that he had not been convinced by Neville and Ginny.
The afternoon wore on with more anecdotes about illustrious
wizards Slughorn had taught, all of whom had been delighted to
join what he called the “Slug Club” at Hogwarts. Harry could not
wait to leave, but couldn’t see how to do so politely. Finally the
train emerged from yet another long misty stretch into a red sunset, and Slughorn looked around, blinking in the twilight.
“Good gracious, it’s getting dark already! I didn’t notice that
they’d lit the lamps! You’d better go and change into your robes,
all of you. McLaggen, you must drop by and borrow that book
on nogtails. Harry, Blaise — any time you’re passing. Same goes
for you, miss,” he twinkled at Ginny. “Well, off you go, off you
go!”
As he pushed past Harry into the darkening corridor, Zabini
shot him a filthy look that Harry returned with interest. He,
Ginny, and Neville followed Zabini back along the train.
“I’m glad that’s over,” muttered Neville. “Strange man, isn’t he?”
“Yeah, he is a bit,” said Harry, his eyes on Zabini. “How come
you ended up in there, Ginny?”
“He saw me hex Zacharias Smith,” said Ginny. “You remember
that idiot from Hufflepuff who was in the D.A.? He kept on and on
asking about what happened at the Ministry and in the end he
annoyed me so much I hexed him — when Slughorn came in I

CHAPTER SEVEN
thought I was going to get detention, but he just thought it was a
really good hex and invited me to lunch! Mad, eh?”
“Better reason for inviting someone than because their mother’s
famous,” said Harry, scowling at the back of Zabini’s head, “or because their uncle —”
But he broke off. An idea had just occurred to him, a reckless
but potentially wonderful idea. . . . In a minute’s time, Zabini was
going to reenter the Slytherin sixth-year compartment and Malfoy
would be sitting there, thinking himself unheard by anybody except fellow Slytherins. . . . If Harry could only enter, unseen, behind him, what might he not see or hear? True, there was little of
the journey left — Hogsmeade Station had to be less than half an
hour away, judging by the wildness of the scenery flashing by the
windows — but nobody else seemed prepared to take Harry’s suspicions seriously, so it was down to him to prove them.
“I’ll see you two later,” said Harry under his breath, pulling out
his Invisibility Cloak and flinging it over himself.
“But what’re you — ?” asked Neville.
“Later!” whispered Harry, darting after Zabini as quietly as possible, though the rattling of the train made such caution almost
pointless.
The corridors were almost completely empty now. Nearly everyone had returned to their carriages to change into their school
robes and pack up their possessions. Though he was as close as he
could get to Zabini without touching him, Harry was not quick
enough to slip into the compartment when Zabini opened the
door. Zabini was already sliding it shut when Harry hastily stuck
out his foot to prevent it closing.



148



THE SLUG CLUB
“What’s wrong with this thing?” said Zabini angrily as he
smashed the sliding door repeatedly into Harry’s foot.
Harry seized the door and pushed it open, hard; Zabini, still
clinging on to the handle, toppled over sideways into Gregory
Goyle’s lap, and in the ensuing ruckus, Harry darted into the compartment, leapt onto Zabini’s temporarily empty seat, and hoisted
himself up into the luggage rack. It was fortunate that Goyle and
Zabini were snarling at each other, drawing all eyes onto them, for
Harry was quite sure his feet and ankles had been revealed as the
cloak had flapped around them; indeed, for one horrible moment
he thought he saw Malfoy’s eyes follow his trainer as it whipped upward out of sight. But then Goyle slammed the door shut and flung
Zabini off him; Zabini collapsed into his own seat looking ruffled,
Vincent Crabbe returned to his comic, and Malfoy, sniggering, lay
back down across two seats with his head in Pansy Parkinson’s lap.
Harry lay curled uncomfortably under the cloak to ensure that
every inch of him remained hidden, and watched Pansy stroke the
sleek blond hair off Malfoy’s forehead, smirking as she did so, as
though anyone would have loved to have been in her place. The
lanterns swinging from the carriage ceiling cast a bright light over
the scene: Harry could read every word of Crabbe’s comic directly
below him.
“So, Zabini,” said Malfoy, “what did Slughorn want?”
“Just trying to make up to well-connected people,” said Zabini,
who was still glowering at Goyle. “Not that he managed to find
many.”
This information did not seem to please Malfoy.
“Who else had he invited?” he demanded.



149



CHAPTER SEVEN
“McLaggen from Gryffindor,” said Zabini.
“Oh yeah, his uncle’s big in the Ministry,” said Malfoy.
“— someone else called Belby, from Ravenclaw —”
“Not him, he’s a prat!” said Pansy.
“— and Longbottom, Potter, and that Weasley girl,” finished
Zabini.
Malfoy sat up very suddenly, knocking Pansy’s hand aside.
“He invited Longbottom?”
“Well, I assume so, as Longbottom was there,” said Zabini
indifferently.
“What’s Longbottom got to interest Slughorn?”
Zabini shrugged.
“Potter, precious Potter, obviously he wanted a look at ‘the Chosen One,’ ” sneered Malfoy, “but that Weasley girl! What’s so special
about her?”
“A lot of boys like her,” said Pansy, watching Malfoy out of the
corner of her eyes for his reaction. “Even you think she’s goodlooking, don’t you, Blaise, and we all know how hard you are to
please!”
“I wouldn’t touch a filthy little blood traitor like her whatever
she looked like,” said Zabini coldly, and Pansy looked pleased.
Malfoy sank back across her lap and allowed her to resume the
stroking of his hair.
“Well, I pity Slughorn’s taste. Maybe he’s going a bit senile.
Shame, my father always said he was a good wizard in his day. My
father used to be a bit of a favorite of his. Slughorn probably hasn’t
heard I’m on the train, or —”
“I wouldn’t bank on an invitation,” said Zabini. “He asked me
about Nott’s father when I first arrived. They used to be old

THE SLUG CLUB
friends, apparently, but when he heard he’d been caught at the
Ministry he didn’t look happy, and Nott didn’t get an invitation,
did he? I don’t think Slughorn’s interested in Death Eaters.”
Malfoy looked angry, but forced out a singularly humorless
laugh.
“Well, who cares what he’s interested in? What is he, when you
come down to it? Just some stupid teacher.” Malfoy yawned ostentatiously. “I mean, I might not even be at Hogwarts next year,
what’s it matter to me if some fat old has-been likes me or not?”
“What do you mean, you might not be at Hogwarts next year?”
said Pansy indignantly, ceasing grooming Malfoy at once.
“Well, you never know,” said Malfoy with the ghost of a smirk.
“I might have — er — moved on to bigger and better things.”
Crouched in the luggage rack under his cloak, Harry’s heart began to race. What would Ron and Hermione say about this?
Crabbe and Goyle were gawping at Malfoy; apparently they had
had no inkling of any plans to move on to bigger and better things.
Even Zabini had allowed a look of curiosity to mar his haughty features. Pansy resumed the slow stroking of Malfoy’s hair, looking
dumbfounded.
“Do you mean — Him?”
Malfoy shrugged.
“Mother wants me to complete my education, but personally, I
don’t see it as that important these days. I mean, think about it. . . .
When the Dark Lord takes over, is he going to care how many
O.W.L.s or N.E.W.T.s anyone’s got? Of course he isn’t. . . . It’ll be all
about the kind of service he received, the level of devotion he was
shown.”
“And you think you’ll be able to do something for him?” asked


151



CHAPTER SEVEN
Zabini scathingly. “Sixteen years old and not even fully qualified
yet?”
“I’ve just said, haven’t I? Maybe he doesn’t care if I’m qualified.
Maybe the job he wants me to do isn’t something that you need to
be qualified for,” said Malfoy quietly.
Crabbe and Goyle were both sitting with their mouths open like
gargoyles. Pansy was gazing down at Malfoy as though she had
never seen anything so awe-inspiring.
“I can see Hogwarts,” said Malfoy, clearly relishing the effect he
had created as he pointed out of the blackened window. “We’d better get our robes on.”
Harry was so busy staring at Malfoy, he did not notice Goyle
reaching up for his trunk; as he swung it down, it hit Harry hard
on the side of the head. He let out an involuntary gasp of pain, and
Malfoy looked up at the luggage rack, frowning.
Harry was not afraid of Malfoy, but he still did not much like
the idea of being discovered hiding under his Invisibility Cloak by
a group of unfriendly Slytherins. Eyes still watering and head still
throbbing, he drew his wand, careful not to disarrange the cloak,
and waited, breath held. To his relief, Malfoy seemed to decide that
he had imagined the noise; he pulled on his robes like the others,
locked his trunk, and as the train slowed to a jerky crawl, fastened
a thick new traveling cloak round his neck.
Harry could see the corridors filling up again and hoped that
Hermione and Ron would take his things out onto the platform
for him; he was stuck where he was until the compartment had
quite emptied. At last, with a final lurch, the train came to a complete halt. Goyle threw the door open and muscled his way out



152



THE SLUG CLUB
into a crowd of second years, punching them aside; Crabbe and
Zabini followed.
“You go on,” Malfoy told Pansy, who was waiting for him with
her hand held out as though hoping he would hold it. “I just want
to check something.”
Pansy left. Now Harry and Malfoy were alone in the compartment. People were filing past, descending onto the dark platform.
Malfoy moved over to the compartment door and let down the
blinds, so that people in the corridor beyond could not peer in. He
then bent down over his trunk and opened it again.
Harry peered down over the edge of the luggage rack, his heart
pumping a little faster. What had Malfoy wanted to hide from
Pansy? Was he about to see the mysterious broken object it was so
important to mend?
“Petrificus Totalus!”
Without warning, Malfoy pointed his wand at Harry, who was
instantly paralyzed. As though in slow motion, he toppled out of
the luggage rack and fell, with an agonizing, floor-shaking crash, at
Malfoy’s feet, the Invisibility Cloak trapped beneath him, his
whole body revealed with his legs still curled absurdly into the
cramped kneeling position. He couldn’t move a muscle; he could
only gaze up at Malfoy, who smiled broadly.
“I thought so,” he said jubilantly. “I heard Goyle’s trunk hit you.
And I thought I saw something white flash through the air after
Zabini came back. . . .”
His eyes lingered for a moment upon Harry’s trainers.
“You didn’t hear anything I care about, Potter. But while I’ve got
you here . . .”



153

CHAPTER SEVEN
And he stamped, hard, on Harry’s face. Harry felt his nose break;
blood spurted everywhere.
“That’s from my father. Now, let’s see. . . .”
Malfoy dragged the cloak out from under Harry’s immobilized
body and threw it over him.
“I don’t reckon they’ll find you till the train’s back in London,”
he said quietly. “See you around, Potter . . . or not.”
And taking care to tread on Harry’s fingers, Malfoy left the
compartment.

SNAPE VICTORIOUS

H

arry could not move a muscle. He lay there beneath the
Invisibility Cloak feeling the blood from his nose flow,
hot and wet, over his face, listening to the voices and footsteps in
the corridor beyond. His immediate thought was that someone,
surely, would check the compartments before the train departed
again. But at once came the dispiriting realization that even if
somebody looked into the compartment, he would be neither seen
nor heard. His best hope was that somebody else would walk in
and step on him.
Harry had never hated Malfoy more than as he lay there, like an
absurd turtle on its back, blood dripping sickeningly into his open
mouth. What a stupid situation to have landed himself in . . . and
now the last few footsteps were dying away; everyone was shuffling
along the dark platform outside; he could hear the scraping of
trunks and the loud babble of talk.
Ron and Hermione would think that he had left the train

without them. Once they arrived at Hogwarts and took their places
in the Great Hall, looked up and down the Gryffindor table a few
times, and finally realized that he was not there, he, no doubt,
would be halfway back to London.
He tried to make a sound, even a grunt, but it was impossible.
Then he remembered that some wizards, like Dumbledore, could
perform spells without speaking, so he tried to summon his wand,
which had fallen out of his hand, by saying the words “Accio
Wand !” over and over again in his head, but nothing happened.
He thought he could hear the rustling of the trees that surrounded the lake, and the far-off hoot of an owl, but no hint of a
search being made or even (he despised himself slightly for hoping
it) panicked voices wondering where Harry Potter had gone. A
feeling of hopelessness spread through him as he imagined the convoy of thestral-drawn carriages trundling up to the school and the
muffled yells of laughter issuing from whichever carriage Malfoy
was riding in, where he could be recounting his attack on Harry to
Crabbe, Goyle, Zabini, and Pansy Parkinson.
The train lurched, causing Harry to roll over onto his side. Now
he was staring at the dusty underside of the seats instead of the ceiling. The floor began to vibrate as the engine roared into life. The
Express was leaving and nobody knew he was still on it. . . .
Then he felt his Invisibility Cloak fly off him and a voice overhead said, “Wotcher, Harry.”
There was a flash of red light and Harry’s body unfroze; he was
able to push himself into a more dignified sitting position, hastily
wipe the blood off his bruised face with the back of his hand, and
raise his head to look up at Tonks, who was holding the Invisibility
Cloak she had just pulled away.

“We’d better get out of here, quickly,” she said, as the train windows became obscured with steam and they began to move out of
the station. “Come on, we’ll jump.”
Harry hurried after her into the corridor. She pulled open the
train door and leapt onto the platform, which seemed to be sliding
underneath them as the train gathered momentum. He followed
her, staggered a little on landing, then straightened up in time to
see the gleaming scarlet steam engine pick up speed, round the corner, and disappear from view.
The cold night air was soothing on his throbbing nose. Tonks
was looking at him; he felt angry and embarrassed that he had been
discovered in such a ridiculous position. Silently she handed him
back the Invisibility Cloak.
“Who did it?”
“Draco Malfoy,” said Harry bitterly. “Thanks for . . . well . . .”
“No problem,” said Tonks, without smiling. From what Harry
could see in the darkness, she was as mousy-haired and miserablelooking as she had been when he had met her at the Burrow. “I can
fix your nose if you stand still.”
Harry did not think much of this idea; he had been intending to
visit Madam Pomfrey, the matron, in whom he had a little more
confidence when it came to Healing Spells, but it seemed rude to
say this, so he stayed stock-still and closed his eyes.
“Episkey,” said Tonks.
Harry’s nose felt very hot, and then very cold. He raised a hand
and felt it gingerly. It seemed to be mended.
“Thanks a lot!”
“You’d better put that cloak back on, and we can walk up to the
school,” said Tonks, still unsmiling. As Harry swung the cloak back

over himself, she waved her wand; an immense silvery four-legged
creature erupted from it and streaked off into the darkness.
“Was that a Patronus?” asked Harry, who had seen Dumbledore
send messages like this.
“Yes, I’m sending word to the castle that I’ve got you or they’ll
worry. Come on, we’d better not dawdle.”
They set off toward the lane that led to the school.
“How did you find me?”
“I noticed you hadn’t left the train and I knew you had that
cloak. I thought you might be hiding for some reason. When I saw
the blinds were drawn down on that compartment I thought I’d
check.”
“But what are you doing here, anyway?” Harry asked.
“I’m stationed in Hogsmeade now, to give the school extra protection,” said Tonks.
“Is it just you who’s stationed up here, or — ?”
“No, Proudfoot, Savage, and Dawlish are here too.”
“Dawlish, that Auror Dumbledore attacked last year?”
“That’s right.”
They trudged up the dark, deserted lane, following the freshly
made carriage tracks. Harry looked sideways at Tonks under his
cloak. Last year she had been inquisitive (to the point of being a little annoying at times), she had laughed easily, she had made jokes.
Now she seemed older and much more serious and purposeful.
Was this all the effect of what had happened at the Ministry? He reflected uncomfortably that Hermione would have suggested he say
something consoling about Sirius to her, that it hadn’t been her
fault at all, but he couldn’t bring himself to do it. He was far from
blaming her for Sirius’s death; it was no more her fault than anyone

SNAPE VICTORIOUS
else’s (and much less than his), but he did not like talking about
Sirius if he could avoid it. And so they tramped on through the
cold night in silence, Tonks’s long cloak whispering on the ground
behind them.
Having always traveled there by carriage, Harry had never before
appreciated just how far Hogwarts was from Hogsmeade Station.
With great relief he finally saw the tall pillars on either side of the
gates, each topped with a winged boar. He was cold, he was hungry, and he was quite keen to leave this new, gloomy Tonks behind.
But when he put out a hand to push open the gates, he found them
chained shut.
“Alohomora!” he said confidently, pointing his wand at the padlock, but nothing happened.
“That won’t work on these,” said Tonks. “Dumbledore bewitched
them himself.”
Harry looked around.
“I could climb a wall,” he suggested.
“No, you couldn’t,” said Tonks flatly. “Anti-intruder jinxes on all
of them. Security’s been tightened a hundredfold this summer.”
“Well then,” said Harry, starting to feel annoyed at her lack of
helpfulness, “I suppose I’ll just have to sleep out here and wait for
morning.”
“Someone’s coming down for you,” said Tonks. “Look.”
A lantern was bobbing at the distant foot of the castle. Harry
was so pleased to see it he felt he could even endure Filch’s wheezy
criticisms of his tardiness and rants about how his timekeeping
would improve with the regular application of thumbscrews. It was
not until the glowing yellow light was ten feet away from them,
and Harry had pulled off his Invisibility Cloak so that he could be

CHAPTER EIGHT
seen, that he recognized, with a rush of pure loathing, the uplit
hooked nose and long, black, greasy hair of Severus Snape.
“Well, well, well,” sneered Snape, taking out his wand and tapping the padlock once, so that the chains snaked backward and the
gates creaked open. “Nice of you to turn up, Potter, although you
have evidently decided that the wearing of school robes would detract from your appearance.”
“I couldn’t change, I didn’t have my —” Harry began, but Snape
cut across him.
“There is no need to wait, Nymphadora, Potter is quite —
ah — safe in my hands.”
“I meant Hagrid to get the message,” said Tonks, frowning.
“Hagrid was late for the start-of-term feast, just like Potter here,
so I took it instead. And incidentally,” said Snape, standing back
to allow Harry to pass him, “I was interested to see your new
Patronus.”
He shut the gates in her face with a loud clang and tapped the
chains with his wand again, so that they slithered, clinking, back
into place.
“I think you were better off with the old one,” said Snape, the
malice in his voice unmistakable. “The new one looks weak.”
As Snape swung the lantern about, Harry saw, fleetingly, a look
of shock and anger on Tonks’s face. Then she was covered in darkness once more.
“Good night,” Harry 
“No, I am a teacher,” said Dumbledore. “I have come to offer
Tom a place at my school.”
“What school’s this, then?”
“It is called Hogwarts,” said Dumbledore.
“And how come you’re interested in Tom?”
“We believe he has qualities we are looking for.”
“You mean he’s won a scholarship? How can he have done? He’s
never been entered for one.”
“Well, his name has been down for our school since birth —”
“Who registered him? His parents?”
There was no doubt that Mrs. Cole was an inconveniently sharp
woman. Apparently Dumbledore thought so too, for Harry now
saw him slip his wand out of the pocket of his velvet suit, at the
same time picking up a piece of perfectly blank paper from Mrs.
Cole’s desktop.
“Here,” said Dumbledore, waving his wand once as he passed
her the piece of paper, “I think this will make everything clear.”
Mrs. Cole’s eyes slid out of focus and back again as she gazed intently at the blank paper for a moment.
“That seems perfectly in order,” she said placidly, handing it
back. Then her eyes fell upon a bottle of gin and two glasses that
had certainly not been present a few seconds before.
“Er — may I offer you a glass of gin?” she said in an extrarefined voice.
“Thank you very much,” said Dumbledore, beaming.
It soon became clear that Mrs. Cole was no novice when it came
to gin drinking. Pouring both of them a generous measure, she
drained her own glass in one gulp. Smacking her lips frankly, she



265



CHAPTER THIRTEEN
smiled at Dumbledore for the first time, and he didn’t hesitate to
press his advantage.
“I was wondering whether you could tell me anything of Tom
Riddle’s history? I think he was born here in the orphanage?”
“That’s right,” said Mrs. Cole, helping herself to more gin. “I remember it clear as anything, because I’d just started here myself.
New Year’s Eve and bitter cold, snowing, you know. Nasty night.
And this girl, not much older than I was myself at the time, came
staggering up the front steps. Well, she wasn’t the first. We took her
in, and she had the baby within the hour. And she was dead in another hour.”
Mrs. Cole nodded impressively and took another generous gulp
of gin.
“Did she say anything before she died?” asked Dumbledore.
“Anything about the boy’s father, for instance?”
“Now, as it happens, she did,” said Mrs. Cole, who seemed to be
rather enjoying herself now, with the gin in her hand and an eager
audience for her story. “I remember she said to me, ‘I hope he looks
like his papa,’ and I won’t lie, she was right to hope it, because she
was no beauty — and then she told me he was to be named Tom,
for his father, and Marvolo, for her father — yes, I know, funny
name, isn’t it? We wondered whether she came from a circus —
and she said the boy’s surname was to be Riddle. And she died soon
after that without another word.
“Well, we named him just as she’d said, it seemed so important
to the poor girl, but no Tom nor Marvolo nor any kind of Riddle
ever came looking for him, nor any family at all, so he stayed in the
orphanage and he’s been here ever since.”
Mrs. Cole helped herself, almost absentmindedly, to another


266

THE SECRET RIDDLE
healthy measure of gin. Two pink spots had appeared high on her
cheekbones. Then she said, “He’s a funny boy.”
“Yes,” said Dumbledore. “I thought he might be.”
“He was a funny baby too. He hardly ever cried, you know. And
then, when he got a little older, he was . . . odd.”
“Odd in what way?” asked Dumbledore gently.
“Well, he —”
But Mrs. Cole pulled up short, and there was nothing blurry or
vague about the inquisitorial glance she shot Dumbledore over her
gin glass.
“He’s definitely got a place at your school, you say?”
“Definitely,” said Dumbledore.
“And nothing I say can change that?”
“Nothing,” said Dumbledore.
“You’ll be taking him away, whatever?”
“Whatever,” repeated Dumbledore gravely.
She squinted at him as though deciding whether or not to trust
him. Apparently she decided she could, because she said in a sudden rush, “He scares the other children.”
“You mean he is a bully?” asked Dumbledore.
“I think he must be,” said Mrs. Cole, frowning slightly, “but it’s
very hard to catch him at it. There have been incidents. . . . Nasty
things . . .”
Dumbledore did not press her, though Harry could tell that he
was interested. She took yet another gulp of gin and her rosy
cheeks grew rosier still.
“Billy Stubbs’s rabbit . . . well, Tom said he didn’t do it and I
don’t see how he could have done, but even so, it didn’t hang itself
from the rafters, did it?”


CHAPTER THIRTEEN
“I shouldn’t think so, no,” said Dumbledore quietly.
“But I’m jiggered if I know how he got up there to do it. All I
know is he and Billy had argued the day before. And then” — Mrs.
Cole took another swig of gin, slopping a little over her chin this
time — “on the summer outing — we take them out, you know,
once a year, to the countryside or to the seaside — well, Amy Benson and Dennis Bishop were never quite right afterwards, and all
we ever got out of them was that they’d gone into a cave with Tom
Riddle. He swore they’d just gone exploring, but something happened in there, I’m sure of it. And, well, there have been a lot of
things, funny things. . . .”
She looked around at Dumbledore again, and though her cheeks
were flushed, her gaze was steady. “I don’t think many people will
be sorry to see the back of him.”
“You understand, I’m sure, that we will not be keeping him permanently?” said Dumbledore. “He will have to return here, at the
very least, every summer.”
“Oh, well, that’s better than a whack on the nose with a rusty
poker,” said Mrs. Cole with a slight hiccup. She got to her feet, and
Harry was impressed to see that she was quite steady, even though
two-thirds of the gin was now gone. “I suppose you’d like to see
him?”
“Very much,” said Dumbledore, rising too.
She led him out of her office and up the stone stairs, calling out
instructions and admonitions to helpers and children as she passed.
The orphans, Harry saw, were all wearing the same kind of grayish
tunic. They looked reasonably well-cared for, but there was no
denying that this was a grim place in which to grow up.
“Here we are,” said Mrs. Cole, as they turned off the second

landing and stopped outside the first door in a long corridor. She
knocked twice and entered.
“Tom? You’ve got a visitor. This is Mr. Dumberton — sorry,
Dunderbore. He’s come to tell you — well, I’ll let him do it.”
Harry and the two Dumbledores entered the room, and Mrs.
Cole closed the door on them. It was a small bare room with nothing in it except an old wardrobe, a wooden chair, and an iron bedstead. A boy was sitting on top of the gray blankets, his legs
stretched out in front of him, holding a book.
There was no trace of the Gaunts in Tom Riddle’s face. Merope
had got her dying wish: He was his handsome father in miniature,
tall for eleven years old, dark-haired, and pale. His eyes narrowed
slightly as he took in Dumbledore’s eccentric appearance. There
was a moment’s silence.
“How do you do, Tom?” said Dumbledore, walking forward and
holding out his hand.
The boy hesitated, then took it, and they shook hands. Dumbledore drew up the hard wooden chair beside Riddle, so that the
pair of them looked rather like a hospital patient and visitor.
“I am Professor Dumbledore.”
“ ‘Professor’?” repeated Riddle. He looked wary. “Is that like
‘doctor’? What are you here for? Did she get you in to have a look
at me?”
He was pointing at the door through which Mrs. Cole had just
left.
“No, no,” said Dumbledore, smiling.
“I don’t believe you,” said Riddle. “She wants me looked at,
doesn’t she? Tell the truth!”
He spoke the last three words with a ringing force that was


269



CHAPTER THIRTEEN
almost shocking. It was a command, and it sounded as though he
had given it many times before. His eyes had widened and he was
glaring at Dumbledore, who made no response except to continue
smiling pleasantly. After a few seconds Riddle stopped glaring,
though he looked, if anything, warier still.
“Who are you?”
“I have told you. My name is Professor Dumbledore and I work
at a school called Hogwarts. I have come to offer you a place at my
school — your new school, if you would like to come.”
Riddle’s reaction to this was most surprising. He leapt from the
bed and backed away from Dumbledore, looking furious.
“You can’t kid me! The asylum, that’s where you’re from, isn’t it?
‘Professor,’ yes, of course — well, I’m not going, see? That old cat’s
the one who should be in the asylum. I never did anything to little
Amy Benson or Dennis Bishop, and you can ask them, they’ll tell
you!”
“I am not from the asylum,” said Dumbledore patiently. “I am a
teacher and, if you will sit down calmly, I shall tell you about Hogwarts. Of course, if you would rather not come to the school, nobody will force you —”
“I’d like to see them try,” sneered Riddle.
“Hogwarts,” Dumbledore went on, as though he had not heard
Riddle’s last words, “is a school for people with special abilities —”
“I’m not mad!”
“I know that you are not mad. Hogwarts is not a school for mad
people. It is a school of magic.”
There was silence. Riddle had frozen, his face expressionless, but
his eyes were flickering back and forth between each of Dumbledore’s, as though trying to catch one of them lying.


THE SECRET RIDDLE
“Magic?” he repeated in a whisper.
“That’s right,” said Dumbledore.
“It’s . . . it’s magic, what I can do?”
“What is it that you can do?”
“All sorts,” breathed Riddle. A flush of excitement was rising up
his neck into his hollow cheeks; he looked fevered. “I can make
things move without touching them. I can make animals do what
I want them to do, without training them. I can make bad things
happen to people who annoy me. I can make them hurt if I want
to.”
His legs were trembling. He stumbled forward and sat down on
the bed again, staring at his hands, his head bowed as though in
prayer.
“I knew I was different,” he whispered to his own quivering fingers. “I knew I was special. Always, I knew there was something.”
“Well, you were quite right,” said Dumbledore, who was no
longer smiling, but watching Riddle intently. “You are a wizard.”
Riddle lifted his head. His face was transfigured: There was a
wild happiness upon it, yet for some reason it did not make him
better looking; on the contrary, his finely carved features seemed
somehow rougher, his expression almost bestial.
“Are you a wizard too?”
“Yes, I am.”
“Prove it,” said Riddle at once, in the same commanding tone he
had used when he had said, “Tell the truth.”
Dumbledore raised his eyebrows. “If, as I take it, you are accepting your place at Hogwarts —”
“Of course I am!”
“Then you will address me as ‘Professor’ or ‘sir.’ ”


CHAPTER THIRTEEN
Riddle’s expression hardened for the most fleeting moment before he said, in an unrecognizably polite voice, “I’m sorry, sir. I
meant — please, Professor, could you show me — ?”
Harry was sure that Dumbledore was going to refuse, that he
would tell Riddle there would be plenty of time for practical
demonstrations at Hogwarts, that they were currently in a building
full of Muggles and must therefore be cautious. To his great surprise, however, Dumbledore drew his wand from an inside pocket
of his suit jacket, pointed it at the shabby wardrobe in the corner,
and gave the wand a casual flick.
The wardrobe burst into flames.
Riddle jumped to his feet; Harry could hardly blame him for
howling in shock and rage; all his worldly possessions must be in
there. But even as Riddle rounded on Dumbledore, the flames vanished, leaving the wardrobe completely undamaged.
Riddle stared from the wardrobe to Dumbledore; then, his expression greedy, he pointed at the wand. “Where can I get one of
them?”
“All in good time,” said Dumbledore. “I think there is something trying to get out of your wardrobe.”
And sure enough, a faint rattling could be heard from inside it.
For the first time, Riddle looked frightened.
“Open the door,” said Dumbledore.
Riddle hesitated, then crossed the room and threw open the
wardrobe door. On the topmost shelf, above a rail of threadbare
clothes, a small cardboard box was shaking and rattling as though
there were several frantic mice trapped inside it.
“Take it out,” said Dumbledore.
Riddle took down the quaking box. He looked unnerved.


272



THE SECRET RIDDLE
“Is there anything in that box that you ought not to have?” asked
Dumbledore.
Riddle threw Dumbledore a long, clear, calculating look. “Yes, I
suppose so, sir,” he said finally, in an expressionless voice.
“Open it,” said Dumbledore.
Riddle took off the lid and tipped the contents onto his bed
without looking at them. Harry, who had expected something
much more exciting, saw a mess of small, everyday objects: a yo-yo,
a silver thimble, and a tarnished mouth organ among them. Once
free of the box, they stopped quivering and lay quite still upon the
thin blankets.
“You will return them to their owners with your apologies,” said
Dumbledore calmly, putting his wand back into his jacket. “I shall
know whether it has been done. And be warned: Thieving is not
tolerated at Hogwarts.”
Riddle did not look remotely abashed; he was still staring coldly
and appraisingly at Dumbledore. At last he said in a colorless voice,
“Yes, sir.”
“At Hogwarts,” Dumbledore went on, “we teach you not only to
use magic, but to control it. You have — inadvertently, I am sure —
been using your powers in a way that is neither taught nor tolerated
at our school. You are not the first, nor will you be the last, to allow
your magic to run away with you. But you should know that Hogwarts can expel students, and the Ministry of Magic — yes, there is
a Ministry — will punish lawbreakers still more severely. All new
wizards must accept that, in entering our world, they abide by our
laws.”
“Yes, sir,” said Riddle again.
It was impossible to tell what he was thinking; his face remained


273

CHAPTER THIRTEEN
quite blank as he put the little cache of stolen objects back into the
cardboard box. When he had finished, he turned to Dumbledore
and said baldly, “I haven’t got any money.”
“That is easily remedied,” said Dumbledore, drawing a leather
money-pouch from his pocket. “There is a fund at Hogwarts for
those who require assistance to buy books and robes. You might have
to buy some of your spellbooks and so on secondhand, but —”
“Where do you buy spellbooks?” interrupted Riddle, who had
taken the heavy money bag without thanking Dumbledore, and
was now examining a fat gold Galleon.
“In Diagon Alley,” said Dumbledore. “I have your list of books
and school equipment with me. I can help you find everything —”
“You’re coming with me?” asked Riddle, looking up.
“Certainly, if you —”
“I don’t need you,” said Riddle. “I’m used to doing things for
myself, I go round London on my own all the time. How do you
get to this Diagon Alley — sir?” he added, catching Dumbledore’s
eye.
Harry thought that Dumbledore would insist upon accompanying Riddle, but once again he was surprised. Dumbledore handed
Riddle the envelope containing his list of equipment, and after
telling Riddle exactly how to get to the Leaky Cauldron from the
orphanage, he said, “You will be able to see it, although Muggles
around you — non-magical people, that is — will not. Ask for
Tom the barman — easy enough to remember, as he shares your
name —”
Riddle gave an irritable twitch, as though trying to displace an
irksome fly.
“You dislike the name ‘Tom’?”


274



THE SECRET RIDDLE
“There are a lot of Toms,” muttered Riddle. Then, as though he
could not suppress the question, as though it burst from him in
spite of himself, he asked, “Was my father a wizard? He was called
Tom Riddle too, they’ve told me.”
“I’m afraid I don’t know,” said Dumbledore, his voice gentle.
“My mother can’t have been magic, or she wouldn’t have died,”
said Riddle, more to himself than Dumbledore. “It must’ve been
him. So — when I’ve got all my stuff — when do I come to this
Hogwarts?”
“All the details are on the second piece of parchment in your envelope,” said Dumbledore. “You will leave from King’s Cross Station on the first of September. There is a train ticket in there too.”
Riddle nodded. Dumbledore got to his feet and held out his
hand again. Taking it, Riddle said, “I can speak to snakes. I found
out when we’ve been to the country on trips — they find me, they
whisper to me. Is that normal for a wizard?”
Harry could tell that he had withheld mention of this strangest
power until that moment, determined to impress.
“It is unusual,” said Dumbledore, after a moment’s hesitation,
“but not unheard of.”
His tone was casual but his eyes moved curiously over Riddle’s
face. They stood for a moment, man and boy, staring at each other.
Then the handshake was broken; Dumbledore was at the door.
“Good-bye, Tom. I shall see you at Hogwarts.”
“I think that will do,” said the white-haired Dumbledore at
Harry’s side, and seconds later, they were soaring weightlessly
through darkness once more, before landing squarely in the presentday office.
“Sit down,” said Dumbledore, landing beside Harry.


275

CHAPTER THIRTEEN
Harry obeyed, his mind still full of what he had just seen.
“He believed it much quicker than I did — I mean, when you
told him he was a wizard,” said Harry. “I didn’t believe Hagrid at
first, when he told me.”
“Yes, Riddle was perfectly ready to believe that he was — to use
his word — ‘special,’ ” said Dumbledore.
“Did you know — then?” asked Harry.
“Did I know that I had just met the most dangerous Dark wizard of all time?” said Dumbledore. “No, I had no idea that he was
to grow up to be what he is. However, I was certainly intrigued by
him. I returned to Hogwarts intending to keep an eye upon him,
something I should have done in any case, given that he was alone
and friendless, but which, already, I felt I ought to do for others’
sake as much as his.
“His powers, as you heard, were surprisingly well-developed for
such a young wizard and — most interestingly and ominously of
all — he had already discovered that he had some measure of control over them, and begun to use them consciously. And as you saw,
they were not the random experiments typical of young wizards:
He was already using magic against other people, to frighten, to
punish, to control. The little stories of the strangled rabbit and the
young boy and girl he lured into a cave were most suggestive. . . .
‘I can make them hurt if I want to. . . .’ ”
“And he was a Parselmouth,” interjected Harry.
“Yes, indeed; a rare ability, and one supposedly connected with
the Dark Arts, although as we know, there are Parselmouths among
the great and the good too. In fact, his ability to speak to serpents
did not make me nearly as uneasy as his obvious instincts for cruelty, secrecy, and domination.

“Time is making fools of us again,” said Dumbledore, indicating
the dark sky beyond the windows. “But before we part, I want to
draw your attention to certain features of the scene we have just
witnessed, for they have a great bearing on the matters we shall be
discussing in future meetings.
“Firstly, I hope you noticed Riddle’s reaction when I mentioned
that another shared his first name, ‘Tom’?”
Harry nodded.
“There he showed his contempt for anything that tied him to
other people, anything that made him ordinary. Even then, he
wished to be different, separate, notorious. He shed his name, as
you know, within a few short years of that conversation and created
the mask of ‘Lord Voldemort’ behind which he has been hidden for
so long.
“I trust that you also noticed that Tom Riddle was already highly
self-sufficient, secretive, and, apparently, friendless? He did not
want help or companionship on his trip to Diagon Alley. He preferred to operate alone. The adult Voldemort is the same. You will
hear many of his Death Eaters claiming that they are in his confidence, that they alone are close to him, even understand him. They
are deluded. Lord Voldemort has never had a friend, nor do I believe that he has ever wanted one.
“And lastly — I hope you are not too sleepy to pay attention to
this, Harry — the young Tom Riddle liked to collect trophies. You
saw the box of stolen articles he had hidden in his room. These
were taken from victims of his bullying behavior, souvenirs, if you
will, of particularly unpleasant bits of magic. Bear in mind this
magpie-like tendency, for this, particularly, will be important later.
“And now, it really is time for bed.”

Harry got to his feet. As he walked across the room, his eyes fell
upon the little table on which Marvolo Gaunt’s ring had rested last
time, but the ring was no longer there.
“Yes, Harry?” said Dumbledore, for Harry had come to a halt.
“The ring’s gone,” said Harry, looking around. “But I thought
you might have the mouth organ or something.”
Dumbledore beamed at him, peering over the top of his halfmoon spectacles.
“Very astute, Harry, but the mouth organ was only ever a mouth
organ.”
And on that enigmatic note he waved to Harry, who understood
himself to be dismissed.

H

arry had Herbology first thing the following morning.
He had been unable to tell Ron and Hermione about
his lesson with Dumbledore over breakfast for fear of being overheard, but he filled them in as they walked across the vegetable
patch toward the greenhouses. The weekend’s brutal wind had died
out at last; the weird mist had returned and it took them a little
longer than usual to find the correct greenhouse.
“Wow, scary thought, the boy You-Know-Who,” said Ron quietly, as they took their places around one of the gnarled Snargaluff
stumps that formed this term’s project, and began pulling on their
protective gloves. “But I still don’t get why Dumbledore’s showing
you all this. I mean, it’s really interesting and everything, but what’s
the point?”
“Dunno,” said Harry, inserting a gum shield. “But he says it’s all
important and it’ll help me survive.”
“I think it’s fascinating,” said Hermione earnestly. “It makes


279



CHAPTER FOURTEEN
absolute sense to know as much about Voldemort as possible. How
else will you find out his weaknesses?”
“So how was Slughorn’s latest party?” Harry asked her thickly
through the gum shield.
“Oh, it was quite fun, really,” said Hermione, now putting on
protective goggles. “I mean, he drones on about famous ex-pupils a
bit, and he absolutely fawns on McLaggen because he’s so wellconnected, but he gave us some really nice food and he introduced
us to Gwenog Jones.”
“Gwenog Jones?” said Ron, his eyes widening under his own
goggles. “The Gwenog Jones? Captain of the Holyhead Harpies?”
“That’s right,” said Hermione. “Personally, I thought she was a
bit full of herself, but —”
“Quite enough chat over here!” said Professor Sprout briskly,
bustling over and looking stern. “You’re lagging behind, everybody
else has started, and Neville’s already got his first pod!”
They looked around; sure enough, there sat Neville with a
bloody lip and several nasty scratches along the side of his face, but
clutching an unpleasantly pulsating green object about the size of a
grapefruit.
“Okay, Professor, we’re starting now!” said Ron, adding quietly,
when she had turned away again, “should’ve used Muffliato, Harry.”
“No, we shouldn’t!” said Hermione at once, looking, as she always did, intensely cross at the thought of the Half-Blood Prince
and his spells. “Well, come on . . . we’d better get going. . . .”
She gave the other two an apprehensive look; they all took deep
breaths and then dived at the gnarled stump between them.
It sprang to life at once; long, prickly, bramblelike vines flew out
of the top and whipped through the air. One tangled itself in


280



FELIX FELICIS
Hermione’s hair, and Ron beat it back with a pair of secateurs;
Harry succeeded in trapping a couple of vines and knotting them
together; a hole opened in the middle of all the tentaclelike
branches; Hermione plunged her arm bravely into this hole, which
closed like a trap around her elbow; Harry and Ron tugged and
wrenched at the vines, forcing the hole to open again, and Hermione snatched her arm free, clutching in her fingers a pod just like
Neville’s. At once, the prickly vines shot back inside, and the
gnarled stump sat there looking like an innocently dead lump of
wood.
“You know, I don’t think I’ll be having any of these in my garden
when I’ve got my own place,” said Ron, pushing his goggles up
onto his forehead and wiping sweat from his face.
“Pass me a bowl,” said Hermione, holding the pulsating pod at
arm’s length; Harry handed one over and she dropped the pod into
it with a look of disgust on her face.
“Don’t be squeamish, squeeze it out, they’re best when they’re
fresh!” called Professor Sprout.
“Anyway,” said Hermione, continuing their interrupted conversation as though a lump of wood had not just attacked them,
“Slughorn’s going to have a Christmas party, Harry, and there’s no
way you’ll be able to wriggle out of this one because he actually
asked me to check your free evenings, so he could be sure to have it
on a night you can come.”
Harry groaned. Meanwhile, Ron, who was attempting to burst
the pod in the bowl by putting both hands on it, standing up, and
squashing it as hard as he could, said angrily, “And this is another
party just for Slughorn’s favorites, is it?”
“Just for the Slug Club, yes,” said Hermione.


281



CHAPTER FOURTEEN
The pod flew out from under Ron’s fingers and hit the greenhouse glass, rebounding onto the back of Professor Sprout’s head
and knocking off her old, patched hat. Harry went to retrieve the
pod; when he got back, Hermione was saying, “Look, I didn’t make
up the name ‘Slug Club’ —”
“ ‘Slug Club,’ ” repeated Ron with a sneer worthy of Malfoy. “It’s
pathetic. Well, I hope you enjoy your party. Why don’t you try
hooking up with McLaggen, then Slughorn can make you King
and Queen Slug —”
“We’re allowed to bring guests,” said Hermione, who for some
reason had turned a bright, boiling scarlet, “and I was going to ask
you to come, but if you think it’s that stupid then I won’t bother!”
Harry suddenly wished the pod had flown a little farther, so that
he need not have been sitting here with the pair of them. Unnoticed by either, he seized the bowl that contained the pod and began to try and open it by the noisiest and most energetic means he
could think of; unfortunately, he could still hear every word of
their conversation.
“You were going to ask me?” asked Ron, in a completely different voice.
“Yes,” said Hermione angrily. “But obviously if you’d rather I
hooked up with McLaggen . . .”
There was a pause while Harry continued to pound the resilient
pod with a trowel.
“No, I wouldn’t,” said Ron, in a very quiet voice.
Harry missed the pod, hit the bowl, and shattered it.
“Reparo,” he said hastily, poking the pieces with his wand, and
the bowl sprang back together again. The crash, however, appeared
to have awoken Ron and Hermione to Harry’s presence. Hermione


282



FELIX FELICIS
looked flustered and immediately started fussing about for her
copy of Flesh-Eating Trees of the World to find out the correct way
to juice Snargaluff pods; Ron, on the other hand, looked sheepish
but also rather pleased with himself.
“Hand that over, Harry,” said Hermione hurriedly. “It says we’re
supposed to puncture them with something sharp. . . .”
Harry passed her the pod in the bowl; he and Ron both snapped
their goggles back over their eyes and dived, once more, for the
stump.
It was not as though he was really surprised, thought Harry, as
he wrestled with a thorny vine intent upon throttling him; he had
had an inkling that this might happen sooner or later. But he was
not sure how he felt about it. . . . He and Cho were now too embarrassed to look at each other, let alone talk to each other; what if
Ron and Hermione started going out together, then split up?
Could their friendship survive it? Harry remembered the few weeks
when they had not been talking to each other in the third year; he
had not enjoyed trying to bridge the distance between them. And
then, what if they didn’t split up? What if they became like Bill and
Fleur, and it became excruciatingly embarrassing to be in their
presence, so that he was shut out for good?
“Gotcha!” yelled Ron, pulling a second pod from the stump just
as Hermione managed to burst the first one open, so that the bowl
was full of tubers wriggling like pale green worms.
The rest of the lesson passed without further mention of
Slughorn’s party. Although Harry watched his two friends more
closely over the next few days, Ron and Hermione did not seem
any different except that they were a little politer to each other than
usual. Harry supposed he would just have to wait to see what


283



CHAPTER FOURTEEN
happened under the influence of butterbeer in Slughorn’s dimly lit
room on the night of the party. In the meantime, however, he had
more pressing worries.
Katie Bell was still in St. Mungo’s Hospital with no prospect of
leaving, which meant that the promising Gryffindor team Harry
had been training so carefully since September was one Chaser
short. He kept putting off replacing Katie in the hope that she
would return, but their opening match against Slytherin was looming, and he finally had to accept that she would not be back in time
to play.
Harry did not think he could stand another full-House tryout.
With a sinking feeling that had little to do with Quidditch, he cornered Dean Thomas after Transfiguration one day. Most of the
class had already left, although several twittering yellow birds were
still zooming around the room, all of Hermione’s creation; nobody
else had succeeded in conjuring so much as a feather from thin air.
“Are you still interested in playing Chaser?”
“Wha — ? Yeah, of course!” said Dean excitedly. Over Dean’s
shoulder, Harry saw Seamus Finnigan slamming his books into his
bag, looking sour. One of the reasons why Harry would have preferred not to have to ask Dean to play was that he knew Seamus
would not like it. On the other hand, he had to do what was best
for the team, and Dean had outflown Seamus at the tryouts.
“Well then, you’re in,” said Harry. “There’s a practice tonight,
seven o’clock.”
“Right,” said Dean. “Cheers, Harry! Blimey, I can’t wait to tell
Ginny!”
He sprinted out of the room, leaving Harry and Seamus alone
together, an uncomfortable moment made no easier when a bird


284



FELIX FELICIS
dropping landed on Seamus’s head as one of Hermione’s canaries
whizzed over them.
Seamus was not the only person disgruntled by the choice of
Katie’s substitute. There was much muttering in the common
room about the fact that Harry had now chosen two of his classmates for the team. As Harry had endured much worse mutterings
than this in his school career, he was not particularly bothered,
but all the same, the pressure was increasing to provide a win in
the upcoming match against Slytherin. If Gryffindor won, Harry
knew that the whole House would forget that they had criticized
him and swear that they had always known it was a great team. If
they lost . . . well, Harry thought wryly, he had still endured worse
mutterings. . . .
Harry had no reason to regret his choice once he saw Dean fly
that evening; he worked well with Ginny and Demelza. The Beaters, Peakes and Coote, were getting better all the time. The only
problem was Ron.
Harry had known all along that Ron was an inconsistent player
who suffered from nerves and a lack of confidence, and unfortunately, the looming prospect of the opening game of the season
seemed to have brought out all his old insecurities. After letting in
half a dozen goals, most of them scored by Ginny, his technique
became wilder and wilder, until he finally punched an oncoming
Demelza Robins in the mouth.
“It was an accident, I’m sorry, Demelza, really sorry!” Ron
shouted after her as she zigzagged back to the ground, dripping
blood everywhere. “I just —”
“Panicked,” Ginny said angrily, landing next to Demelza and examining her fat lip. “You prat, Ron, look at the state of her!”


285



CHAPTER FOURTEEN
“I can fix that,” said Harry, landing beside the two girls, pointing
his wand at Demelza’s mouth, and saying “Episkey.” “And Ginny,
don’t call Ron a prat, you’re not the Captain of this team —”
“Well, you seemed too busy to call him a prat and I thought
someone should —”
Harry forced himself not to laugh.
“In the air, everyone, let’s go. . . .”
Overall it was one of the worst practices they had had all term,
though Harry did not feel that honesty was the best policy when
they were this close to the match.
“Good work, everyone, I think we’ll flatten Slytherin,” he said
bracingly and the Chasers and Beaters left the changing room
looking reasonably happy with themselves.
“I played like a sack of dragon dung,” said Ron in a hollow voice
when the door had swung shut behind Ginny.
“No, you didn’t,” said Harry firmly. “You’re the best Keeper I
tried out, Ron. Your only problem is nerves.”
He kept up a relentless flow of encouragement all the way back
to the castle, and by the time they reached the second floor, Ron
was looking marginally more cheerful. When Harry pushed open
the tapestry to take their usual shortcut up to Gryffindor Tower,
however, they found themselves looking at Dean and Ginny, who
were locked in a close embrace and kissing fiercely as though glued
together.
It was as though something large and scaly erupted into life in
Harry’s stomach, clawing at his insides: Hot blood seemed to flood
his brain, so that all thought was extinguished, replaced by a savage
urge to jinx Dean into a jelly. Wrestling with this sudden madness,
he heard Ron’s voice as though from a great distance away.


286



FELIX FELICIS
“Oi!”
Dean and Ginny broke apart and looked around.
“What?” said Ginny.
“I don’t want to find my own sister snogging people in public!”
“This was a deserted corridor till you came butting in!” said
Ginny.
Dean was looking embarrassed. He gave Harry a shifty grin that
Harry did not return, as the newborn monster inside him was roaring for Dean’s instant dismissal from the team.
“Er . . . c’mon, Ginny,” said Dean, “let’s go back to the common
room. . . .”
“You go!” said Ginny. “I want a word with my dear brother!”
Dean left, looking as though he was not sorry to depart the
scene.
“Right,” said Ginny, tossing her long red hair out of her face and
glaring at Ron, “let’s get this straight once and for all. It is none of
your business who I go out with or what I do with them, Ron —”
“Yeah, it is!” said Ron, just as angrily. “D’you think I want people saying my sister’s a —”
“A what?” shouted Ginny, drawing her wand. “A what, exactly?”
“He doesn’t mean anything, Ginny —” said Harry automatically, though the monster was roaring its approval of Ron’s words.
“Oh yes he does!” she said, flaring up at Harry. “Just because he’s
never snogged anyone in his life, just because the best kiss he’s ever
had is from our Auntie Muriel —”
“Shut your mouth!” bellowed Ron, bypassing red and turning
maroon.
“No, I will not!” yelled Ginny, beside herself. “I’ve seen you with
Phlegm, hoping she’ll kiss you on the cheek every time you see her,


287



CHAPTER FOURTEEN
it’s pathetic! If you went out and got a bit of snogging done yourself, you wouldn’t mind so much that everyone else does it!”
Ron had pulled out his wand too; Harry stepped swiftly between
them.
“You don’t know what you’re talking about!” Ron roared, trying
to get a clear shot at Ginny around Harry, who was now standing
in front of her with his arms outstretched. “Just because I don’t do
it in public — !”
Ginny screamed with derisive laughter, trying to push Harry out
of the way.
“Been kissing Pigwidgeon, have you? Or have you got a picture
of Auntie Muriel stashed under your pillow?”
“You—”
A streak of orange light flew under Harry’s left arm and missed
Ginny by inches; Harry pushed Ron up against the wall.
“Don’t be stupid —”
“Harry’s snogged Cho Chang!” shouted Ginny, who sounded
close to tears now. “And Hermione snogged Viktor Krum, it’s only
you who acts like it’s something disgusting, Ron, and that’s because
you’ve got about as much experience as a twelve-year-old!”
And with that, she stormed away. Harry quickly let go of Ron;
the look on his face was murderous. They both stood there, breathing heavily, until Mrs. Norris, Filch’s cat, appeared around the corner, which broke the tension.
“C’mon,” said Harry, as the sound of Filch’s shuffling feet
reached their ears.
They hurried up the stairs and along a seventh-floor corridor.
“Oi, out of the way!” Ron barked at a small girl who jumped in
fright and dropped a bottle of toadspawn.


288



FELIX FELICIS
Harry hardly noticed the sound of shattering glass; he felt disoriented, dizzy; being struck by a lightning bolt must be something
like this. It’s just because she’s Ron’s sister, he told himself. You just
didn’t like seeing her kissing Dean because she’s Ron’s sister. . . .
But unbidden into his mind came an image of that same deserted corridor with himself kissing Ginny instead. . . . The monster in his chest purred . . . but then he saw Ron ripping open the
tapestry curtain and drawing his wand on Harry, shouting things
like “betrayal of trust” . . . “supposed to be my friend” . . .
“D’you think Hermione did snog Krum?” Ron asked abruptly,
as they approached the Fat Lady. Harry gave a guilty start and
wrenched his imagination away from a corridor in which no Ron
intruded, in which he and Ginny were quite alone —
“What?” he said confusedly. “Oh . . . er . . .”
The honest answer was “yes,” but he did not want to give it.
However, Ron seemed to gather the worst from the look on Harry’s
face.
“Dilligrout,” he said darkly to the Fat Lady, and they climbed
through the portrait hole into the common room.
Neither of them mentioned Ginny or Hermione again; indeed,
they barely spoke to each other that evening and got into bed in silence, each absorbed in his own thoughts.
Harry lay awake for a long time, looking up at the canopy of his
four-poster and trying to convince himself that his feelings for
Ginny were entirely elder-brotherly. They had lived, had they not,
like brother and sister all summer, playing Quidditch, teasing Ron,
and having a laugh about Bill and Phlegm? He had known Ginny
for years now. . . . It was natural that he should feel protective . . .
natural that he should want to look out for her . . . want to rip


289



CHAPTER FOURTEEN
Dean limb from limb for kissing her . . . No . . . he would have to
control that particular brotherly feeling. . . .
Ron gave a great grunting snore.
She’s Ron’s sister, Harry told himself firmly. Ron’s sister. She’s out-ofbounds. He would not risk his friendship with Ron for anything.
He punched his pillow into a more comfortable shape and waited
for sleep to come, trying his utmost not to allow his thoughts to
stray anywhere near Ginny.
Harry awoke next morning feeling slightly dazed and confused
by a series of dreams in which Ron had chased him with a Beater’s
bat, but by midday he would have happily exchanged the dream
Ron for the real one, who was not only cold-shouldering Ginny
and Dean, but also treating a hurt and bewildered Hermione with
an icy, sneering indifference. What was more, Ron seemed to have
become, overnight, as touchy and ready to lash out as the average
Blast-Ended Skrewt. Harry spent the day attempting to keep the
peace between Ron and Hermione with no success; finally, Hermione departed for bed in high dudgeon, and Ron stalked off to the
boys’ dormitory after swearing angrily at several frightened first
years for looking at him.
To Harry’s dismay, Ron’s new aggression did not wear off over the
next few days. Worse still, it coincided with an even deeper dip in his
Keeping skills, which made him still more aggressive, so that during
the final Quidditch practice before Saturday’s match, he failed to
save every single goal the Chasers aimed at him, but bellowed at
everybody so much that he reduced Demelza Robins to tears.
“You shut up and leave her alone!” shouted Peakes, who was about
two-thirds Ron’s height, though admittedly carrying a heavy bat.



290



FELIX FELICIS
“ENOUGH!” bellowed Harry, who had seen Ginny glowering
in Ron’s direction and, remembering her reputation as an accomplished caster of the Bat-Bogey Hex, soared over to intervene before things got out of hand. “Peakes, go and pack up the Bludgers.
Demelza, pull yourself together, you played really well today.
Ron . . .” he waited until the rest of the team were out of earshot
before saying it, “you’re my best mate, but carry on treating the rest
of them like this and I’m going to kick you off the team.”
He really thought for a moment that Ron might hit him, but then
something much worse happened: Ron seemed to sag on his broom;
all the fight went out of him and he said, “I resign. I’m pathetic.”
“You’re not pathetic and you’re not resigning!” said Harry
fiercely, seizing Ron by the front of his robes. “You can save anything when you’re on form, it’s a mental problem you’ve got!”
“You calling me mental?”
“Yeah, maybe I am!”
They glared at each other for a moment, then Ron shook his
head wearily. “I know you haven’t got any time to find another
Keeper, so I’ll play tomorrow, but if we lose, and we will, I’m taking myself off the team.”
Nothing Harry said made any difference. He tried boosting
Ron’s confidence all through dinner, but Ron was too busy being
grumpy and surly with Hermione to notice. Harry persisted in
the common room that evening, but his assertion that the whole
team would be devastated if Ron left was somewhat undermined
by the fact that the rest of the team was sitting in a huddle in a
distant corner, clearly muttering about Ron and casting him
nasty looks. Finally Harry tried getting angry again in the hope



291



CHAPTER FOURTEEN
of provoking Ron into a defiant, and hopefully goal-saving,
attitude, but this strategy did not appear to work any better than
encouragement; Ron went to bed as dejected and hopeless as
ever.
Harry lay awake for a very long time in the darkness. He did not
want to lose the upcoming match; not only was it his first as Captain, but he was determined to beat Draco Malfoy at Quidditch
even if he could not yet prove his suspicions about him. Yet if Ron
played as he had done in the last few practices, their chances of
winning were very slim. . . .
If only there was something he could do to make Ron pull himself together . . . make him play at the top of his form . . . something that would ensure that Ron had a really good day. . . .
And the answer came to Harry in one, sudden, glorious stroke of
inspiration.
Breakfast was the usual excitable affair next morning; the
Slytherins hissed and booed loudly as every member of the Gryffindor team entered the Great Hall. Harry glanced at the ceiling and
saw a clear, pale blue sky: a good omen.
The Gryffindor table, a solid mass of red and gold, cheered as
Harry and Ron approached. Harry grinned and waved; Ron grimaced weakly and shook his head.
“Cheer up, Ron!” called Lavender. “I know you’ll be brilliant!”
Ron ignored her.
“Tea?” Harry asked him. “Coffee? Pumpkin juice?”
“Anything,” said Ron glumly, taking a moody bite of toast.
A few minutes later Hermione, who had become so tired of
Ron’s recent unpleasant behavior that she had not come down to
breakfast with them, paused on her way up the table.


292



FELIX FELICIS
“How are you both feeling?” she asked tentatively, her eyes on
the back of Ron’s head.
“Fine,” said Harry, who was concentrating on handing Ron a
glass of pumpkin juice. “There you go, Ron. Drink up.”
Ron had just raised the glass to his lips when Hermione spoke
sharply.
“Don’t drink that, Ron!”
Both Harry and Ron looked up at her.
“Why not?” said Ron.
Hermione was now staring at Harry as though she could not believe her eyes.
“You just put something in that drink.”
“Excuse me?” said Harry.
“You heard me. I saw you. You just tipped something into Ron’s
drink. You’ve got the bottle in your hand right now!”
“I don’t know what you’re talking about,” said Harry, stowing
the little bottle hastily in his pocket.
“Ron, I warn you, don’t drink it!” Hermione said again,
alarmed, but Ron picked up the glass, drained it in one gulp, and
said, “Stop bossing me around, Hermione.”
She looked scandalized. Bending low so that only Harry could
hear her, she hissed, “You should be expelled for that. I’d never have
believed it of you, Harry!”
“Hark who’s talking,” he whispered back. “Confunded anyone
lately?”
She stormed up the table away from them. Harry watched her go
without regret. Hermione had never really understood what a
serious business Quidditch was. He then looked around at Ron,
who was smacking his lips.


293

CHAPTER FOURTEEN
“Nearly time,” said Harry blithely.
The frosty grass crunched underfoot as they strode down to the
stadium.
“Pretty lucky the weather’s this good, eh?” Harry asked Ron.
“Yeah,” said Ron, who was pale and sick-looking.
Ginny and Demelza were already wearing their Quidditch robes
and waiting in the changing room.
“Conditions look ideal,” said Ginny, ignoring Ron. “And guess
what? That Slytherin Chaser Vaisey — he took a Bludger in the
head yesterday during their practice, and he’s too sore to play! And
even better than that — Malfoy’s gone off sick too!”
“What?” said Harry, wheeling around to stare at her. “He’s ill?
What’s wrong with him?”
“No idea, but it’s great for us,” said Ginny brightly. “They’re
playing Harper instead; he’s in my year and he’s an idiot.”
Harry smiled back vaguely, but as he pulled on his scarlet robes
his mind was far from Quidditch. Malfoy had once before claimed
he could not play due to injury, but on that occasion he had made
sure the whole match was rescheduled for a time that suited the
Slytherins better. Why was he now happy to let a substitute go on?
Was he really ill, or was he faking?
“Fishy, isn’t it?” he said in an undertone to Ron. “Malfoy not
playing?”
“Lucky, I call it,” said Ron, looking slightly more animated.
“And Vaisey off too, he’s their best goal scorer, I didn’t fancy —
hey!” he said suddenly, freezing halfway through pulling on his
Keeper’s gloves and staring at Harry.
“What?”



294



FELIX FELICIS
“I . . . you . . .” Ron had dropped his voice, he looked both
scared and excited. “My drink . . . my pumpkin juice . . . you
didn’t . . . ?”
Harry raised his eyebrows, but said nothing except, “We’ll be
starting in about five minutes, you’d better get your boots on.”
They walked out onto the pitch to tumultuous roars and boos.
One end of the stadium was solid red and gold; the other, a sea of
green and silver. Many Hufflepuffs and Ravenclaws had taken sides
too: Amidst all the yelling and clapping Harry could distinctly hear
the roar of Luna Lovegood’s famous lion-topped hat.
Harry stepped up to Madam Hooch, the referee, who was standing ready to release the balls from the crate.
“Captains shake hands,” she said, and Harry had his hand
crushed by the new Slytherin Captain, Urquhart. “Mount your
brooms. On the whistle . . . three . . . two . . . one . . .”
The whistle sounded, Harry and the others kicked off hard from
the frozen ground, and they were away.
Harry soared around the perimeter of the grounds, looking
around for the Snitch and keeping one eye on Harper, who was
zigzagging far below him. Then a voice that was jarringly different
to the usual commentator’s started up.
“Well, there they go, and I think we’re all surprised to see the
team that Potter’s put together this year. Many thought, given
Ronald Weasley’s patchy performance as Keeper last year, that he
might be off the team, but of course, a close personal friendship
with the Captain does help. . . .”
These words were greeted with jeers and applause from the
Slytherin end of the pitch. Harry craned around on his broom to



295



CHAPTER FOURTEEN
look toward the commentator’s podium. A tall, skinny blond boy
with an upturned nose was standing there, talking into the magical
megaphone that had once been Lee Jordan’s; Harry recognized
Zacharias Smith, a Hufflepuff player whom he heartily disliked.
“Oh, and here comes Slytherin’s first attempt on goal, it’s
Urquhart streaking down the pitch and —”
Harry’s stomach turned over.
“— Weasley saves it, well, he’s bound to get lucky sometimes, I
suppose. . . .”
“That’s right, Smith, he is,” muttered Harry, grinning to himself, as he dived amongst the Chasers with his eyes searching all
around for some hint of the elusive Snitch.
With half an hour of the game gone, Gryffindor were leading
sixty points to zero, Ron having made some truly spectacular saves,
some by the very tips of his gloves, and Ginny having scored four of
Gryffindor’s six goals. This effectively stopped Zacharias wondering loudly whether the two Weasleys were only there because
Harry liked them, and he started on Peakes and Coote instead.
“Of course, Coote isn’t really the usual build for a Beater,” said
Zacharias loftily, “they’ve generally got a bit more muscle —”
“Hit a Bludger at him!” Harry called to Coote as he zoomed
past, but Coote, grinning broadly, chose to aim the next Bludger at
Harper instead, who was just passing Harry in the opposite direction. Harry was pleased to hear the dull thunk that meant the
Bludger had found its mark.
It seemed as though Gryffindor could do no wrong. Again and
again they scored, and again and again, at the other end of the
pitch, Ron saved goals with apparent ease. He was actually smiling
now, and when the crowd greeted a particularly good save with a


296



FELIX FELICIS
rousing chorus of the old favorite “Weasley Is Our King,” he pretended to conduct them from on high.
“Thinks he’s something special today, doesn’t he?” said a snide
voice, and Harry was nearly knocked off his broom as Harper collided with him hard and deliberately. “Your blood-traitor pal . . .”
Madam Hooch’s back was turned, and though Gryffindors below shouted in anger, by the time she looked around, Harper had
already sped off. His shoulder aching, Harry raced after him, determined to ram him back. . . .
“And I think Harper of Slytherin’s seen the Snitch!” said
Zacharias Smith through his megaphone. “Yes, he’s certainly seen
something Potter hasn’t!”
Smith really was an idiot, thought Harry, hadn’t he noticed them
collide? But next moment, his stomach seemed to drop out of the
sky — Smith was right and Harry was wrong: Harper had not sped
upward at random; he had spotted what Harry had not: The Snitch
was speeding along high above them, glinting brightly against the
clear blue sky.
Harry accelerated; the wind was whistling in his ears so that it
drowned all sound of Smith’s commentary or the crowd, but
Harper was still ahead of him, and Gryffindor was only a hundred
points up; if Harper got there first Gryffindor had lost . . . and now
Harper was feet from it, his hand outstretched. . . .
“Oi, Harper!” yelled Harry in desperation. “How much did
Malfoy pay you to come on instead of him?”
He did not know what made him say it, but Harper did a double-take; he fumbled the Snitch, let it slip through his fingers, and
shot right past it. Harry made a great swipe for the tiny, fluttering

“YES!” Harry yelled. Wheeling around, he hurtled back toward
the ground, the Snitch held high in his hand. As the crowd realized
what had happened, a great shout went up that almost drowned
the sound of the whistle that signaled the end of the game.
“Ginny, where’re you going?” yelled Harry, who had found himself trapped in the midst of a mass midair hug with the rest of the
team, but Ginny sped right on past them until, with an almighty
crash, she collided with the commentator’s podium. As the crowd
shrieked and laughed, the Gryffindor team landed beside the
wreckage of wood under which Zacharias was feebly stirring;
Harry heard Ginny saying blithely to an irate Professor McGonagall, “Forgot to brake, Professor, sorry.”
Laughing, Harry broke free of the rest of the team and hugged
Ginny, but let go very quickly. Avoiding her gaze, he clapped a
cheering Ron on the back instead as, all enmity forgotten, the
Gryffindor team left the pitch arm in arm, punching the air and
waving to their supporters.
The atmosphere in the changing room was jubilant.
“Party up in the common room, Seamus said!” yelled Dean exuberantly. “C’mon, Ginny, Demelza!”
Ron and Harry were the last two in the changing room. They
were just about to leave when Hermione entered. She was twisting
her Gryffindor scarf in her hands and looked upset but determined.
“I want a word with you, Harry.” She took a deep breath. “You
shouldn’t have done it. You heard Slughorn, it’s illegal.”
“What are you going to do, turn us in?” demanded Ron.
“What are you two talking about?” asked Harry, turning away to
hang up his robes so that neither of them would see him grinning.
“You know perfectly well what we’re talking about!” said Hermi

one shrilly. “You spiked Ron’s juice with lucky potion at breakfast!
Felix Felicis!”
“No, I didn’t,” said Harry, turning back to face them both.
“Yes you did, Harry, and that’s why everything went right, there
were Slytherin players missing and Ron saved everything!”
“I didn’t put it in!” said Harry, grinning broadly. He slipped his
hand inside his jacket pocket and drew out the tiny bottle that
Hermione had seen in his hand that morning. It was full of golden
potion and the cork was still tightly sealed with wax. “I wanted
Ron to think I’d done it, so I faked it when I knew you were looking.” He looked at Ron. “You saved everything because you felt
lucky. You did it all yourself.”
He pocketed the potion again.
“There really wasn’t anything in my pumpkin juice?” Ron said,
astounded. “But the weather’s good . . . and Vaisey couldn’t play.
. . . I honestly haven’t been given lucky potion?”
Harry shook his head. Ron gaped at him for a moment, then
rounded on Hermione, imitating her voice. “You added Felix Felicis
to Ron’s juice this morning, that’s why he saved everything! See! I can
save goals without help, Hermione!”
“I never said you couldn’t — Ron, you thought you’d been given
it too!”
But Ron had already strode past her out of the door with his
broomstick over his shoulder.
“Er,” said Harry into the sudden silence; he had not expected his
plan to backfire like this, “shall . . . shall we go up to the party,
then?”
“You go!” said Hermione, blinking back tears. “I’m sick of Ron
at the moment, I don’t know what I’m supposed to have done. . . .”

And she stormed out of the changing room too.
Harry walked slowly back up the grounds toward the castle
through the crowd, many of whom shouted congratulations at
him, but he felt a great sense of letdown; he had been sure that if
Ron won the match, he and Hermione would be friends again immediately. He did not see how he could possibly explain to Hermione that what she had done to offend Ron was kiss Viktor Krum,
not when the offense had occurred so long ago.
Harry could not see Hermione at the Gryffindor celebration
party, which was in full swing when he arrived. Renewed cheers
and clapping greeted his appearance, and he was soon surrounded
by a mob of people congratulating him. What with trying to shake
off the Creevey brothers, who wanted a blow-by-blow match
analysis, and the large group of girls that encircled him, laughing at
his least amusing comments and batting their eyelids, it was some
time before he could try and find Ron. At last, he extricated himself from Romilda Vane, who was hinting heavily that she would
like to go to Slughorn’s Christmas party with him. As he was ducking toward the drinks table, he walked straight into Ginny, Arnold
the Pygmy Puff riding on her shoulder and Crookshanks mewing
hopefully at her heels.
“Looking for Ron?” she asked, smirking. “He’s over there, the
filthy hypocrite.”
Harry looked into the corner she was indicating. There, in full
view of the whole room, stood Ron wrapped so closely around
Lavender Brown it was hard to tell whose hands were whose.
“It looks like he’s eating her face, doesn’t it?” said Ginny dispassionately. “But I suppose he’s got to refine his technique somehow.
Good game, Harry.”


FELIX FELICIS
She patted him on the arm; Harry felt a swooping sensation in his
stomach, but then she walked off to help herself to more butterbeer.
Crookshanks trotted after her, his yellow eyes fixed upon Arnold.
Harry turned away from Ron, who did not look like he would
be surfacing soon, just as the portrait hole was closing. With a sinking feeling, he thought he saw a mane of bushy brown hair whipping out of sight.
He darted forward, sidestepped Romilda Vane again, and
pushed open the portrait of the Fat Lady. The corridor outside
seemed to be deserted.
“Hermione?”
He found her in the first unlocked classroom he tried. She was
sitting on the teacher’s desk, alone except for a small ring of twittering yellow birds circling her head, which she had clearly just
conjured out of midair. Harry could not help admiring her spellwork at a time like this.
“Oh, hello, Harry,” she said in a brittle voice. “I was just practicing.”
“Yeah . . . they’re — er — really good. . . .” said Harry.
He had no idea what to say to her. He was just wondering
whether there was any chance that she had not noticed Ron, that
she had merely left the room because the party was a little too
rowdy, when she said, in an unnaturally high-pitched voice, “Ron
seems to be enjoying the celebrations.”
“Er . . . does he?” said Harry.
“Don’t pretend you didn’t see him,” said Hermione. “He wasn’t
exactly hiding it, was — ?”
The door behind them burst open. To Harry’s horror, Ron came
in, laughing, pulling Lavender by the hand.


CHAPTER FOURTEEN
“Oh,” he said, drawing up short at the sight of Harry and
Hermione.
“Oops!” said Lavender, and she backed out of the room, giggling. The door swung shut behind her.
There was a horrible, swelling, billowing silence. Hermione was
staring at Ron, who refused to look at her, but said with an odd
mixture of bravado and awkwardness, “Hi, Harry! Wondered
where you’d got to!”
Hermione slid off the desk. The little flock of golden birds continued to twitter in circles around her head so that she looked like
a strange, feathery model of the solar system.
“You shouldn’t leave Lavender waiting outside,” she said quietly.
“She’ll wonder where you’ve gone.”
She walked very slowly and erectly toward the door. Harry
glanced at Ron, who was looking relieved that nothing worse had
happened.
“Oppugno!” came a shriek from the doorway.
Harry spun around to see Hermione pointing her wand at Ron,
her expression wild: The little flock of birds was speeding like a hail
of fat golden bullets toward Ron, who yelped and covered his face
with his hands, but the birds attacked, pecking and clawing at
every bit of flesh they could reach.
“Gerremoffme!” he yelled, but with one last look of vindictive
fury, Hermione wrenched open the door and disappeared through
it. Harry thought he heard a sob before it slammed.

now was swirling against the icy windows once more; Christmas was approaching fast. Hagrid had already single-handedly
delivered the usual twelve Christmas trees for the Great Hall; garlands of holly and tinsel had been twisted around the banisters of
the stairs; everlasting candles glowed from inside the helmets of
suits of armor and great bunches of mistletoe had been hung at intervals along the corridors. Large groups of girls tended to converge
underneath the mistletoe bunches every time Harry went past,
which caused blockages in the corridors; fortunately, however,
Harry’s frequent nighttime wanderings had given him an unusually
good knowledge of the castle’s secret passageways, so that he was
able, without too much difficulty, to navigate mistletoe-free routes
between classes.
Ron, who might once have found the necessity of these detours
a cause for jealousy rather than hilarity, simply roared with laughter about it all. Although Harry much preferred this new laughing,


joking Ron to the moody, aggressive model he had been enduring
for the last few weeks, the improved Ron came at a heavy price.
Firstly, Harry had to put up with the frequent presence of Lavender Brown, who seemed to regard any moment that she was not
kissing Ron as a moment wasted; and secondly, Harry found himself once more the best friend of two people who seemed unlikely
ever to speak to each other again.
Ron, whose hands and forearms still bore scratches and cuts
from Hermione’s bird attack, was taking a defensive and resentful
tone.
“She can’t complain,” he told Harry. “She snogged Krum. So
she’s found out someone wants to snog me too. Well, it’s a free
country. I haven’t done anything wrong.”
Harry did not answer, but pretended to be absorbed in the book
they were supposed to have read before Charms next morning
(Quintessence: A Quest). Determined as he was to remain friends
with both Ron and Hermione, he was spending a lot of time with
his mouth shut tight.
“I never promised Hermione anything,” Ron mumbled. “I
mean, all right, I was going to go to Slughorn’s Christmas party
with her, but she never said . . . just as friends . . . I’m a free
agent. . . .”
Harry turned a page of Quintessence, aware that Ron was watching him. Ron’s voice tailed away in mutters, barely audible over the
loud crackling of the fire, though Harry thought he caught the
words “Krum” and “can’t complain” again.
Hermione’s schedule was so full that Harry could only talk to
her properly in the evenings, when Ron was, in any case, so tightly

wrapped around Lavender that he did not notice what Harry was
doing. Hermione refused to sit in the common room while Ron
was there, so Harry generally joined her in the library, which meant
that their conversations were held in whispers.
“He’s at perfect liberty to kiss whomever he likes,” said Hermione, while the librarian, Madam Pince, prowled the shelves behind
them. “I really couldn’t care less.”
She raised her quill and dotted an i so ferociously that she punctured a hole in her parchment. Harry said nothing. He thought his
voice might soon vanish from lack of use. He bent a little lower
over Advanced Potion-Making and continued to make notes on
Everlasting Elixirs, occasionally pausing to decipher the Prince’s
useful additions to Libatius Borage’s text.
“And incidentally,” said Hermione, after a few moments, “you
need to be careful.”
“For the last time,” said Harry, speaking in a slightly hoarse
whisper after three-quarters of an hour of silence, “I am not giving
back this book, I’ve learned more from the Half-Blood Prince than
Snape or Slughorn have taught me in —”
“I’m not talking about your stupid so-called Prince,” said Hermione, giving his book a nasty look as though it had been rude to
her. “I’m talking about earlier. I went into the girls’ bathroom just
before I came in here and there were about a dozen girls in there,
including that Romilda Vane, trying to decide how to slip you a
love potion. They’re all hoping they’re going to get you to take
them to Slughorn’s party, and they all seem to have bought Fred
and George’s love potions, which I’m afraid to say probably
work —”



305

CHAPTER FIFTEEN
“Why didn’t you confiscate them then?” demanded Harry. It
seemed extraordinary that Hermione’s mania for upholding rules
could have abandoned her at this crucial juncture.
“They didn’t have the potions with them in the bathroom,” said
Hermione scornfully. “They were just discussing tactics. As I doubt
whether even the Half-Blood Prince” — she gave the book another
nasty look — “could dream up an antidote for a dozen different
love potions at once, I’d just invite someone to go with you, that’ll
stop all the others thinking they’ve still got a chance. It’s tomorrow
night, they’re getting desperate.”
“There isn’t anyone I want to invite,” mumbled Harry, who was
still trying not to think about Ginny any more than he could help,
despite the fact that she kept cropping up in his dreams in ways
that made him devoutly thankful that Ron could not perform
Legilimency.
“Well, just be careful what you drink, because Romilda Vane
looked like she meant business,” said Hermione grimly.
She hitched up the long roll of parchment on which she was
writing her Arithmancy essay and continued to scratch away with
her quill. Harry watched her with his mind a long way away.
“Hang on a moment,” he said slowly. “I thought Filch had
banned anything bought at Weasleys’ Wizard Wheezes?”
“And when has anyone ever paid attention to what Filch has
banned?” asked Hermione, still concentrating on her essay.
“But I thought all the owls were being searched. So how come
these girls are able to bring love potions into school?”
“Fred and George send them disguised as perfumes and cough
potions,” said Hermione. “It’s part of their Owl Order Service.”
“You know a lot about it.”


306

THE UNBREAKABLE VOW
Hermione gave him the kind of nasty look she had just given his
copy of Advanced Potion-Making.
“It was all on the back of the bottles they showed Ginny and me
in the summer,” she said coldly. “I don’t go around putting potions
in people’s drinks . . . or pretending to, either, which is just as
bad. . . .”
“Yeah, well, never mind that,” said Harry quickly. “The point is,
Filch is being fooled, isn’t he? These girls are getting stuff into the
school disguised as something else! So why couldn’t Malfoy have
brought the necklace into the school — ?”
“Oh, Harry . . . not that again . . .”
“Come on, why not?” demanded Harry.
“Look,” sighed Hermione, “Secrecy Sensors detect jinxes, curses,
and concealment charms, don’t they? They’re used to find Dark
Magic and Dark objects. They’d have picked up a powerful curse,
like the one on that necklace, within seconds. But something that’s
just been put in the wrong bottle wouldn’t register — and anyway,
love potions aren’t Dark or dangerous —”
“Easy for you to say,” muttered Harry, thinking of Romilda
Vane.
“— so it would be down to Filch to realize it wasn’t a cough potion, and he’s not a very good wizard, I doubt he can tell one potion from —”
Hermione stopped dead; Harry had heard it too. Somebody had
moved close behind them among the dark bookshelves. They
waited, and a moment later the vulturelike countenance of Madam
Pince appeared around the corner, her sunken cheeks, her skin like
parchment, and her long hooked nose illuminated unflatteringly
by the lamp she was carrying.

“The library is now closed,” she said. “Mind you return anything you have borrowed to the correct — what have you been doing to that book, you depraved boy?”
“It isn’t the library’s, it’s mine!” said Harry hastily, snatching his
copy of Advanced Potion-Making off the table as she lunged at it
with a clawlike hand.
“Despoiled!” she hissed. “Desecrated! Befouled!”
“It’s just a book that’s been written on!” said Harry, tugging it
out of her grip.
She looked as though she might have a seizure; Hermione, who
had hastily packed her things, grabbed Harry by the arm and frogmarched him away.
“She’ll ban you from the library if you’re not careful. Why did
you have to bring that stupid book?”
“It’s not my fault she’s barking mad, Hermione. Or d’you think
she overheard you being rude about Filch? I’ve always thought there
might be something going on between them. . . .”
“Oh, ha ha . . .”
Enjoying the fact that they could speak normally again, they
made their way along the deserted, lamp-lit corridors back to the
common room, arguing about whether or not Filch and Madam
Pince were secretly in love with each other.
“Baubles,” said Harry to the Fat Lady, this being the new, festive
password.
“Same to you,” said the Fat Lady with a roguish grin, and she
swung forward to admit them.
“Hi, Harry!” said Romilda Vane, the moment he had climbed
through the portrait hole. “Fancy a gillywater?”

Hermione gave him a “what-did-I-tell-you?” look over her
shoulder.
“No thanks,” said Harry quickly. “I don’t like it much.”
“Well, take these anyway,” said Romilda, thrusting a box into his
hands. “Chocolate Cauldrons, they’ve got firewhisky in them. My
gran sent them to me, but I don’t like them.”
“Oh — right — thanks a lot,” said Harry, who could not think
what else to say. “Er — I’m just going over here with . . .”
He hurried off behind Hermione, his voice tailing away feebly.
“Told you,” said Hermione succinctly. “Sooner you ask someone, sooner they’ll all leave you alone and you can —”
But her face suddenly turned blank; she had just spotted Ron
and Lavender, who were entwined in the same armchair.
“Well, good night, Harry,” said Hermione, though it was only
seven o’clock in the evening, and she left for the girls’ dormitory
without another word.
Harry went to bed comforting himself that there was only one
more day of lessons to struggle through, plus Slughorn’s party, after
which he and Ron would depart together for the Burrow. It now
seemed impossible that Ron and Hermione would make up with
each other before the holidays began, but perhaps, somehow, the
break would give them time to calm down, think better of their
behavior. . . .
But his hopes were not high, and they sank still lower after enduring a Transfiguration lesson with them both next day. They had
just embarked upon the immensely difficult topic of human Transfiguration; working in front of mirrors, they were supposed to be
changing the color of their own eyebrows. Hermione laughed



309



CHAPTER FIFTEEN
unkindly at Ron’s disastrous first attempt, during which he somehow managed to give himself a spectacular handlebar mustache;
Ron retaliated by doing a cruel but accurate impression of Hermione jumping up and down in her seat every time Professor McGonagall asked a question, which Lavender and Parvati found deeply
amusing and which reduced Hermione to the verge of tears again.
She raced out of the classroom on the bell, leaving half her things
behind; Harry, deciding that her need was greater than Ron’s just
now, scooped up her remaining possessions and followed her.
He finally tracked her down as she emerged from a girls’ bathroom on the floor below. She was accompanied by Luna Lovegood,
who was patting her vaguely on the back.
“Oh, hello, Harry,” said Luna. “Did you know one of your eyebrows is bright yellow?”
“Hi, Luna. Hermione, you left your stuff. . . .”
He held out her books.
“Oh yes,” said Hermione in a choked voice, taking her things
and turning away quickly to hide the fact that she was wiping her
eyes on her pencil case. “Thank you, Harry. Well, I’d better get going. . . .”
And she hurried off, without giving Harry any time to offer
words of comfort, though admittedly he could not think of any.
“She’s a bit upset,” said Luna. “I thought at first it was Moaning
Myrtle in there, but it turned out to be Hermione. She said something about that Ron Weasley. . . .”
“Yeah, they’ve had a row,” said Harry.
“He says very funny things sometimes, doesn’t he?” said Luna, as
they set off down the corridor together. “But he can be a bit unkind. I noticed that last year.”

THE UNBREAKABLE VOW
“I s’pose,” said Harry. Luna was demonstrating her usual knack
of speaking uncomfortable truths; he had never met anyone quite
like her. “So have you had a good term?”
“Oh, it’s been all right,” said Luna. “A bit lonely without the
D.A. Ginny’s been nice, though. She stopped two boys in our
Transfiguration class calling me ‘Loony’ the other day —”
“How would you like to come to Slughorn’s party with me
tonight?”
The words were out of Harry’s mouth before he could stop
them; he heard himself say them as though it were a stranger
speaking.
Luna turned her protuberant eyes upon him in surprise.
“Slughorn’s party? With you?”
“Yeah,” said Harry. “We’re supposed to bring guests, so I
thought you might like . . . I mean . . .” He was keen to make his
intentions perfectly clear. “I mean, just as friends, you know. But if
you don’t want to . . .”
He was already half hoping that she didn’t want to.
“Oh, no, I’d love to go with you as friends!” said Luna, beaming
as he had never seen her beam before. “Nobody’s ever asked me to
a party before, as a friend! Is that why you dyed your eyebrow, for
the party? Should I do mine too?”
“No,” said Harry firmly, “that was a mistake. I’ll get Hermione
to put it right for me. So, I’ll meet you in the entrance hall at eight
o’clock then.”
“AHA!” screamed a voice from overhead and both of them
jumped; unnoticed by either of them, they had just passed right
underneath Peeves, who was hanging upside down from a chandelier and grinning maliciously at them.

“Potty asked Loony to go to the party! Potty lurves Loony! Potty
luuuuurves Looooooony!”
And he zoomed away, cackling and shrieking, “Potty loves Loony!”
“Nice to keep these things private,” said Harry. And sure
enough, in no time at all the whole school seemed to know that
Harry Potter was taking Luna Lovegood to Slughorn’s party.
“You could’ve taken anyone!” said Ron in disbelief over dinner.
“Anyone! And you chose Loony Lovegood?”
“Don’t call her that, Ron,” snapped Ginny, pausing behind
Harry on her way to join friends. “I’m really glad you’re taking her,
Harry, she’s so excited.”
And she moved on down the table to sit with Dean. Harry tried
to feel pleased that Ginny was glad he was taking Luna to the party,
but could not quite manage it. A long way along the table, Hermione was sitting alone, playing with her stew. Harry noticed Ron
looking at her furtively.
“You could say sorry,” suggested Harry bluntly.
“What, and get attacked by another flock of canaries?” muttered
Ron.
“What did you have to imitate her for?”
“She laughed at my mustache!”
“So did I, it was the stupidest thing I’ve ever seen.”
But Ron did not seem to have heard; Lavender had just arrived
with Parvati. Squeezing herself in between Harry and Ron, Lavender flung her arms around Ron’s neck.
“Hi, Harry,” said Parvati who, like him, looked faintly embarrassed and bored by the behavior of their two friends.
“Hi,” said Harry. “How’re you? You’re staying at Hogwarts,
then? I heard your parents wanted you to leave.”

THE UNBREAKABLE VOW
“I managed to talk them out of it for the time being,” said Parvati. “That Katie thing really freaked them out, but as there hasn’t
been anything since . . . Oh, hi, Hermione!”
Parvati positively beamed. Harry could tell that she was feeling
guilty for having laughed at Hermione in Transfiguration. He
looked around and saw that Hermione was beaming back, if possible even more brightly. Girls were very strange sometimes.
“Hi, Parvati!” said Hermione, ignoring Ron and Lavender completely. “Are you going to Slughorn’s party tonight?”
“No invite,” said Parvati gloomily. “I’d love to go, though, it
sounds like it’s going to be really good. . . . You’re going, aren’t you?”
“Yes, I’m meeting Cormac at eight, and we’re —”
There was a noise like a plunger being withdrawn from a
blocked sink and Ron surfaced. Hermione acted as though she had
not seen or heard anything.
“— we’re going up to the party together.”
“Cormac?” said Parvati. “Cormac McLaggen, you mean?”
“That’s right,” said Hermione sweetly. “The one who almost” —
she put a great deal of emphasis on the word — “became Gryffindor Keeper.”
“Are you going out with him, then?” asked Parvati, wide-eyed.
“Oh — yes — didn’t you know?” said Hermione, with a most
un-Hermione-ish giggle.
“No!” said Parvati, looking positively agog at this piece of gossip.
“Wow, you like your Quidditch players, don’t you? First Krum,
then McLaggen . . .”
“I like really good Quidditch players,” Hermione corrected her,
still smiling. “Well, see you . . . Got to go and get ready for the
party. . . .”

CHAPTER FIFTEEN
She left. At once Lavender and Parvati put their heads together
to discuss this new development, with everything they had ever
heard about McLaggen, and all they had ever guessed about Hermione. Ron looked strangely blank and said nothing. Harry was
left to ponder in silence the depths to which girls would sink to get
revenge.
When he arrived in the entrance hall at eight o’clock that night,
he found an unusually large number of girls lurking there, all of
whom seemed to be staring at him resentfully as he approached
Luna. She was wearing a set of spangled silver robes that were attracting a certain amount of giggles from the onlookers, but otherwise she looked quite nice. Harry was glad, in any case, that she
had left off her radish earrings, her butterbeer cork necklace, and
her Spectrespecs.
“Hi,” he said. “Shall we get going then?”
“Oh yes,” she said happily. “Where is the party?”
“Slughorn’s office,” said Harry, leading her up the marble staircase away from all the staring and muttering. “Did you hear, there’s
supposed to be a vampire coming?”
“Rufus Scrimgeour?” asked Luna.
“I — what?” said Harry, disconcerted. “You mean the Minister
of Magic?”
“Yes, he’s a vampire,” said Luna matter-of-factly. “Father wrote a
very long article about it when Scrimgeour first took over from
Cornelius Fudge, but he was forced not to publish by somebody
from the Ministry. Obviously, they didn’t want the truth to get
out!”
Harry, who thought it most unlikely that Rufus Scrimgeour was
a vampire, but who was used to Luna repeating her father’s bizarre


THE UNBREAKABLE VOW
views as though they were fact, did not reply; they were already
approaching Slughorn’s office and the sounds of laughter, music,
and loud conversation were growing louder with every step they
took.
Whether it had been built that way, or because he had used magical trickery to make it so, Slughorn’s office was much larger than
the usual teacher’s study. The ceiling and walls had been draped
with emerald, crimson, and gold hangings, so that it looked as
though they were all inside a vast tent. The room was crowded and
stuffy and bathed in the red light cast by an ornate golden lamp
dangling from the center of the ceiling in which real fairies were
fluttering, each a brilliant speck of light. Loud singing accompanied by what sounded like mandolins issued from a distant corner;
a haze of pipe smoke hung over several elderly warlocks deep in
conversation, and a number of house-elves were negotiating their
way squeakily through the forest of knees, obscured by the heavy
silver platters of food they were bearing, so that they looked like little roving tables.
“Harry, m’boy!” boomed Slughorn, almost as soon as Harry and
Luna had squeezed in through the door. “Come in, come in, so
many people I’d like you to meet!”
Slughorn was wearing a tasseled velvet hat to match his smoking
jacket. Gripping Harry’s arm so tightly he might have been hoping
to Disapparate with him, Slughorn led him purposefully into the
party; Harry seized Luna’s hand and dragged her along with him.
“Harry, I’d like you to meet Eldred Worple, an old student of
mine, author of Blood Brothers: My Life Amongst the Vampires —
and, of course, his friend Sanguini.”
Worple, who was a small, stout, bespectacled man, grabbed


315

CHAPTER FIFTEEN
Harry’s hand and shook it enthusiastically; the vampire Sanguini,
who was tall and emaciated with dark shadows under his eyes,
merely nodded. He looked rather bored. A gaggle of girls was
standing close to him, looking curious and excited.
“Harry Potter, I am simply delighted!” said Worple, peering
shortsightedly up into Harry’s face. “I was saying to Professor
Slughorn only the other day, ‘Where is the biography of Harry Potter
for which we have all been waiting?’ ”
“Er,” said Harry, “were you?”
“Just as modest as Horace described!” said Worple. “But seriously” — his manner changed; it became suddenly businesslike —
“I would be delighted to write it myself — people are craving to
know more about you, dear boy, craving! If you were prepared to
grant me a few interviews, say in four- or five-hour sessions, why,
we could have the book finished within months. And all with very
little effort on your part, I assure you — ask Sanguini here if it isn’t
quite — Sanguini, stay here!” added Worple, suddenly stern, for
the vampire had been edging toward the nearby group of girls, a
rather hungry look in his eye. “Here, have a pasty,” said Worple,
seizing one from a passing elf and stuffing it into Sanguini’s hand
before turning his attention back to Harry.
“My dear boy, the gold you could make, you have no idea —”
“I’m definitely not interested,” said Harry firmly, “and I’ve just
seen a friend of mine, sorry.”
He pulled Luna after him into the crowd; he had indeed just
seen a long mane of brown hair disappear between what looked
like two members of the Weird Sisters.
“Hermione! Hermione!”
“Harry! There you are, thank goodness! Hi, Luna!”

“What’s happened to you?” asked Harry, for Hermione looked
distinctly disheveled, rather as though she had just fought her way
out of a thicket of Devil’s Snare.
“Oh, I’ve just escaped — I mean, I’ve just left Cormac,” she
said. “Under the mistletoe,” she added in explanation, as Harry
continued to look questioningly at her.
“Serves you right for coming with him,” he told her severely.
“I thought he’d annoy Ron most,” said Hermione dispassionately. “I debated for a while about Zacharias Smith, but I thought,
on the whole —”
“You considered Smith?” said Harry, revolted.
“Yes, I did, and I’m starting to wish I’d chosen him, McLaggen
makes Grawp look a gentleman. Let’s go this way, we’ll be able to
see him coming, he’s so tall. . . .”
The three of them made their way over to the other side of the
room, scooping up goblets of mead on the way, realizing too late
that Professor Trelawney was standing there alone.
“Hello,” said Luna politely to Professor Trelawney.
“Good evening, my dear,” said Professor Trelawney, focusing
upon Luna with some difficulty. Harry could smell cooking sherry
again. “I haven’t seen you in my classes lately. . . .”
“No, I’ve got Firenze this year,” said Luna.
“Oh, of course,” said Professor Trelawney with an angry,
drunken titter. “Or Dobbin, as I prefer to think of him. You would
have thought, would you not, that now I am returned to the school
Professor Dumbledore might have got rid of the horse? But no . . .
we share classes. . . . It’s an insult, frankly, an insult. Do you
know . . .”
Professor Trelawney seemed too tipsy to have recognized Harry.

Under cover of her furious criticisms of Firenze, Harry drew closer
to Hermione and said, “Let’s get something straight. Are you planning to tell Ron that you interfered at Keeper tryouts?”
Hermione raised her eyebrows. “Do you really think I’d stoop
that low?”
Harry looked at her shrewdly. “Hermione, if you can ask out
McLaggen —”
“There’s a difference,” said Hermione with dignity. “I’ve got no
plans to tell Ron anything about what might, or might not, have
happened at Keeper tryouts.”
“Good,” said Harry fervently. “Because he’ll just fall apart again,
and we’ll lose the next match —”
“Quidditch!” said Hermione angrily. “Is that all boys care about?
Cormac hasn’t asked me one single question about myself, no, I’ve
just been treated to ‘A Hundred Great Saves Made by Cormac
McLaggen’ nonstop ever since — oh no, here he comes!”
She moved so fast it was as though she had Disapparated; one
moment she was there, the next, she had squeezed between two
guffawing witches and vanished.
“Seen Hermione?” asked McLaggen, forcing his way through
the throng a minute later.
“No, sorry,” said Harry, and he turned quickly to join in Luna’s
conversation, forgetting for a split second to whom she was talking.
“Harry Potter!” said Professor Trelawney in deep, vibrant tones,
noticing him for the first time.
“Oh, hello,” said Harry unenthusiastically.
“My dear boy!” she said in a very carrying whisper. “The rumors!
The stories! ‘The Chosen One’! Of course, I have known for a very
long time. . . . The omens were never good, Harry. . . . But why

have you not returned to Divination? For you, of all people, the
subject is of the utmost importance!”
“Ah, Sybill, we all think our subject’s most important!” said a
loud voice, and Slughorn appeared at Professor Trelawney’s other
side, his face very red, his velvet hat a little askew, a glass of mead
in one hand and an enormous mince pie in the other. “But I don’t
think I’ve ever known such a natural at Potions!” said Slughorn, regarding Harry with a fond, if bloodshot, eye. “Instinctive, you
know — like his mother! I’ve only ever taught a few with this kind
of ability, I can tell you that, Sybill — why even Severus —”
And to Harry’s horror, Slughorn threw out an arm and seemed
to scoop Snape out of thin air toward them.
“Stop skulking and come and join us, Severus!” hiccuped
Slughorn happily. “I was just talking about Harry’s exceptional potion-making! Some credit must go to you, of course, you taught
him for five years!”
Trapped, with Slughorn’s arm around his shoulders, Snape
looked down his hooked nose at Harry, his black eyes narrowed.
“Funny, I never had the impression that I managed to teach
Potter anything at all.”
“Well, then, it’s natural ability!” shouted Slughorn. “You should
have seen what he gave me, first lesson, Draught of Living Death —
never had a student produce finer on a first attempt, I don’t think
even you, Severus —”
“Really?” said Snape quietly, his eyes still boring into Harry, who
felt a certain disquiet. The last thing he wanted was for Snape to
start investigating the source of his newfound brilliance at Potions.
“Remind me what other subjects you’re taking, Harry?” asked
Slughorn.


319



CHAPTER FIFTEEN
“Defense Against the Dark Arts, Charms, Transfiguration,
Herbology . . .”
“All the subjects required, in short, for an Auror,” said Snape,
with the faintest sneer.
“Yeah, well, that’s what I’d like to do,” said Harry defiantly.
“And a great one you’ll make too!” boomed Slughorn.
“I don’t think you should be an Auror, Harry,” said Luna unexpectedly. Everybody looked at her. “The Aurors are part of the
Rotfang Conspiracy, I thought everyone knew that. They’re working to bring down the Ministry of Magic from within using a combination of Dark Magic and gum disease.”
Harry inhaled half his mead up his nose as he started to laugh.
Really, it had been worth bringing Luna just for this. Emerging
from his goblet, coughing, sopping wet but still grinning, he saw
something calculated to raise his spirits even higher: Draco Malfoy
being dragged by the ear toward them by Argus Filch.
“Professor Slughorn,” wheezed Filch, his jowls aquiver and the
maniacal light of mischief-detection in his bulging eyes, “I discovered this boy lurking in an upstairs corridor. He claims to have
been invited to your party and to have been delayed in setting out.
Did you issue him with an invitation?”
Malfoy pulled himself free of Filch’s grip, looking furious.
“All right, I wasn’t invited!” he said angrily. “I was trying to gatecrash, happy?”
“No, I’m not!” said Filch, a statement at complete odds with the
glee on his face. “You’re in trouble, you are! Didn’t the headmaster
say that nighttime prowling’s out, unless you’ve got permission,
didn’t he, eh?”
“That’s all right, Argus, that’s all right,” said Slughorn, waving a


320



THE UNBREAKABLE VOW
hand. “It’s Christmas, and it’s not a crime to want to come to a
party. Just this once, we’ll forget any punishment; you may stay,
Draco.”
Filch’s expression of outraged disappointment was perfectly predictable; but why, Harry wondered, watching him, did Malfoy
look almost equally unhappy? And why was Snape looking at Malfoy as though both angry and . . . was it possible? . . . a little afraid?
But almost before Harry had registered what he had seen, Filch
had turned and shuffled away, muttering under his breath; Malfoy
had composed his face into a smile and was thanking Slughorn for
his generosity, and Snape’s face was smoothly inscrutable again.
“It’s nothing, nothing,” said Slughorn, waving away Malfoy’s
thanks. “I did know your grandfather, after all. . . .”
“He always spoke very highly of you, sir,” said Malfoy quickly.
“Said you were the best potion-maker he’d ever known. . . .”
Harry stared at Malfoy. It was not the sucking-up that intrigued
him; he had watched Malfoy do that to Snape for a long time. It
was the fact that Malfoy did, after all, look a little ill. This was the
first time he had seen Malfoy close up for ages; he now saw that
Malfoy had dark shadows under his eyes and a distinctly grayish
tinge to his skin.
“I’d like a word with you, Draco,” said Snape suddenly.
“Oh, now, Severus,” said Slughorn, hiccuping again, “it’s Christmas, don’t be too hard —”
“I’m his Head of House, and I shall decide how hard, or otherwise, to be,” said Snape curtly. “Follow me, Draco.”
They left, Snape leading the way, Malfoy looking resentful.
Harry stood there for a moment, irresolute, then said, “I’ll be back
in a bit, Luna — er — bathroom.”

“All right,” she said cheerfully, and he thought he heard her, as
he hurried off into the crowd, resume the subject of the Rotfang
Conspiracy with Professor Trelawney, who seemed sincerely interested.
It was easy, once out of the party, to pull his Invisibility Cloak
out of his pocket and throw it over himself, for the corridor was
quite deserted. What was more difficult was finding Snape and
Malfoy. Harry ran down the corridor, the noise of his feet masked
by the music and loud talk still issuing from Slughorn’s office behind him. Perhaps Snape had taken Malfoy to his office in the dungeons . . . or perhaps he was escorting him back to the Slytherin
common room. . . . Harry pressed his ear against door after door as
he dashed down the corridor until, with a great jolt of excitement,
he crouched down to the keyhole of the last classroom in the corridor and heard voices.
“. . . cannot afford mistakes, Draco, because if you are expelled —”
“I didn’t have anything to do with it, all right?”
“I hope you are telling the truth, because it was both clumsy and
foolish. Already you are suspected of having a hand in it.”
“Who suspects me?” said Malfoy angrily. “For the last time, I
didn’t do it, okay? That Bell girl must’ve had an enemy no one
knows about — don’t look at me like that! I know what you’re doing, I’m not stupid, but it won’t work — I can stop you!”
There was a pause and then Snape said quietly, “Ah . . . Aunt
Bellatrix has been teaching you Occlumency, I see. What thoughts
are you trying to conceal from your master, Draco?”
“I’m not trying to conceal anything from him, I just don’t want
you butting in!”


322



THE UNBREAKABLE VOW
Harry pressed his ear still more closely against the keyhole. . . .
What had happened to make Malfoy speak to Snape like this —
Snape, toward whom he had always shown respect, even liking?
“So that is why you have been avoiding me this term? You have
feared my interference? You realize that, had anybody else failed to
come to my office when I had told them repeatedly to be there,
Draco —”
“So put me in detention! Report me to Dumbledore!” jeered
Malfoy.
There was another pause. Then Snape said, “You know perfectly
well that I do not wish to do either of those things.”
“You’d better stop telling me to come to your office then!”
“Listen to me,” said Snape, his voice so low now that Harry had
to push his ear very hard against the keyhole to hear. “I am trying
to help you. I swore to your mother I would protect you. I made
the Unbreakable Vow, Draco —”
“Looks like you’ll have to break it, then, because I don’t need
your protection! It’s my job, he gave it to me and I’m doing it, I’ve
got a plan and it’s going to work, it’s just taking a bit longer than I
thought it would!”
“What is your plan?”
“It’s none of your business!”
“If you tell me what you are trying to do, I can assist you —”
“I’ve got all the assistance I need, thanks, I’m not alone!”
“You were certainly alone tonight, which was foolish in the extreme, wandering the corridors without lookouts or backup, these
are elementary mistakes —”
“I would’ve had Crabbe and Goyle with me if you hadn’t put
them in detention!”


323



CHAPTER FIFTEEN
“Keep your voice down!” spat Snape, for Malfoy’s voice had
risen excitedly. “If your friends Crabbe and Goyle intend to pass
their Defense Against the Dark Arts O.W.L. this time around, they
will need to work a little harder than they are doing at pres —”
“What does it matter?” said Malfoy. “Defense Against the Dark
Arts — it’s all just a joke, isn’t it, an act? Like any of us need protecting against the Dark Arts —”
“It is an act that is crucial to success, Draco!” said Snape. “Where
do you think I would have been all these years, if I had not known
how to act? Now listen to me! You are being incautious, wandering
around at night, getting yourself caught, and if you are placing
your reliance in assistants like Crabbe and Goyle —”
“They’re not the only ones, I’ve got other people on my side,
better people!”
“Then why not confide in me, and I can —”
“I know what you’re up to! You want to steal my glory!”
There was another pause, then Snape said coldly, “You are
speaking like a child. I quite understand that your father’s capture
and imprisonment has upset you, but —”
Harry had barely a second’s warning; he heard Malfoy’s footsteps
on the other side of the door and flung himself out of the way just
as it burst open; Malfoy was striding away down the corridor, past
the open door of Slughorn’s office, around the distant corner, and
out of sight.
Hardly daring to breathe, Harry remained crouched down as
Snape emerged slowly from the classroom. His expression unfathomable, he returned to the party. Harry remained on the floor, hidden beneath the cloak, his mind racing.

S

o Snape was offering to help him? He was definitely offering to
help him?”
“If you ask that once more,” said Harry, “I’m going to stick this
sprout —”
“I’m only checking!” said Ron. They were standing alone at the
Burrow’s kitchen sink, peeling a mountain of sprouts for Mrs.
Weasley. Snow was drifting past the window in front of them.
“Yes, Snape was offering to help him!” said Harry. “He said he’d
promised Malfoy’s mother to protect him, that he’d made an Unbreakable Oath or something —”
“An Unbreakable Vow?” said Ron, looking stunned. “Nah, he
can’t have. . . . Are you sure?”
“Yes, I’m sure,” said Harry. “Why, what does it mean?”
“Well, you can’t break an Unbreakable Vow. . . .”
“I’d worked that much out for myself, funnily enough. What
happens if you break it, then?”

“You die,” said Ron simply. “Fred and George tried to get me to
make one when I was about five. I nearly did too, I was holding
hands with Fred and everything when Dad found us. He went
mental,” said Ron, with a reminiscent gleam in his eyes. “Only
time I’ve ever seen Dad as angry as Mum. Fred reckons his left buttock has never been the same since.”
“Yeah, well, passing over Fred’s left buttock —”
“I beg your pardon?” said Fred’s voice as the twins entered the
kitchen.
“Aaah, George, look at this. They’re using knives and everything.
Bless them.”
“I’ll be seventeen in two and a bit months’ time,” said Ron
grumpily, “and then I’ll be able to do it by magic!”
“But meanwhile,” said George, sitting down at the kitchen table
and putting his feet up on it, “we can enjoy watching you demonstrate the correct use of a — whoops-a-daisy!”
“You made me do that!” said Ron angrily, sucking his cut
thumb. “You wait, when I’m seventeen —”
“I’m sure you’ll dazzle us all with hitherto unsuspected magical
skills,” yawned Fred.
“And speaking of hitherto unsuspected skills, Ronald,” said
George, “what is this we hear from Ginny about you and a young
lady called — unless our information is faulty — Lavender Brown?”
Ron turned a little pink, but did not look displeased as he
turned back to the sprouts. “Mind your own business.”
“What a snappy retort,” said Fred. “I really don’t know how you
think of them. No, what we wanted to know was . . . how did it
happen?”



A VERY FROSTY

“What d’you mean?”
“Did she have an accident or something?”
“What?”
“Well, how did she sustain such extensive brain damage? Careful, now!”
Mrs. Weasley entered the room just in time to see Ron throw the
sprout knife at Fred, who had turned it into a paper airplane with
one lazy flick of his wand.
“Ron!” she said furiously. “Don’t you ever let me see you throwing knives again!”
“I won’t,” said Ron, “let you see,” he added under his breath, as
he turned back to the sprout mountain.
“Fred, George, I’m sorry, dears, but Remus is arriving tonight, so
Bill will have to squeeze in with you two.”
“No problem,” said George.
“Then, as Charlie isn’t coming home, that just leaves Harry and
Ron in the attic, and if Fleur shares with Ginny —”
“— that’ll make Ginny’s Christmas —” muttered Fred.
“— everyone should be comfortable. Well, they’ll have a bed,
anyway,” said Mrs. Weasley, sounding slightly harassed.
“Percy definitely not showing his ugly face, then?” asked Fred.
Mrs. Weasley turned away before she answered. “No, he’s busy, I
expect, at the Ministry.”
“Or he’s the world’s biggest prat,” said Fred, as Mrs. Weasley left
the kitchen. “One of the two. Well, let’s get going, then, George.”
“What are you two up to?” asked Ron. “Can’t you help us with
these sprouts? You could just use your wand and then we’ll be free
too!”

CHAPTER SIXTEEN
“No, I don’t think we can do that,” said Fred seriously. “It’s very
character-building stuff, learning to peel sprouts without magic,
makes you appreciate how difficult it is for Muggles and Squibs —”
“— and if you want people to help you, Ron,” added George,
throwing the paper airplane at him, “I wouldn’t chuck knives at
them. Just a little hint. We’re off to the village, there’s a very pretty
girl working in the paper shop who thinks my card tricks are something marvelous . . . almost like real magic. . . .”
“Gits,” said Ron darkly, watching Fred and George setting off
across the snowy yard. “Would’ve only taken them ten seconds and
then we could’ve gone too.”
“I couldn’t,” said Harry. “I promised Dumbledore I wouldn’t
wander off while I’m staying here.”
“Oh yeah,” said Ron. He peeled a few more sprouts and then
said, “Are you going to tell Dumbledore what you heard Snape and
Malfoy saying to each other?”
“Yep,” said Harry. “I’m going to tell anyone who can put a stop
to it, and Dumbledore’s top of the list. I might have another word
with your dad too.”
“Pity you didn’t hear what Malfoy’s actually doing, though.”
“I couldn’t have done, could I? That was the whole point, he was
refusing to tell Snape.”
There was silence for a moment or two, then Ron said, “ ’Course,
you know what they’ll all say? Dad and Dumbledore and all of
them? They’ll say Snape isn’t really trying to help Malfoy, he was
just trying to find out what Malfoy’s up to.”
“They didn’t hear him,” said Harry flatly. “No one’s that good an
actor, not even Snape.”
“Yeah . . . I’m just saying, though,” said Ron.


328



A VERY FROSTY
CHRISTMAS
Harry turned to face him, frowning. “You think I’m right,
though?”
“Yeah, I do!” said Ron hastily. “Seriously, I do! But they’re all
convinced Snape’s in the Order, aren’t they?”
Harry said nothing. It had already occurred to him that this
would be the most likely objection to his new evidence; he could
hear Hermione now: Obviously, Harry, he was pretending to offer
help so he could trick Malfoy into telling him what he’s doing. . . .
This was pure imagination, however, as he had had no opportunity to tell Hermione what he had overheard. She had disappeared
from Slughorn’s parry before he returned to it, or so he had been
informed by an irate McLaggen, and she had already gone to bed
by the time he returned to the common room. As he and Ron had
left for the Burrow early the next day, he had barely had time to
wish her a happy Christmas and to tell her that he had some very
important news when they got back from the holidays. He was not
entirely sure that she had heard him, though; Ron and Lavender
had been saying a thoroughly nonverbal good-bye just behind him
at the time.
Still, even Hermione would not be able to deny one thing: Malfoy was definitely up to something, and Snape knew it, so Harry
felt fully justified in saying “I told you so,” which he had done several times to Ron already.
Harry did not get the chance to speak to Mr. Weasley, who was
working very long hours at the Ministry, until Christmas Eve
night. The Weasleys and their guests were sitting in the living
room, which Ginny had decorated so lavishly that it was rather like
sitting in a paper-chain explosion. Fred, George, Harry, and Ron
were the only ones who knew that the angel on top of the tree was


329



CHAPTER SIXTEEN
actually a garden gnome that had bitten Fred on the ankle as he
pulled up carrots for Christmas dinner. Stupefied, painted gold,
stuffed into a miniature tutu and with small wings glued to its
back, it glowered down at them all, the ugliest angel Harry had ever
seen, with a large bald head like a potato and rather hairy feet.
They were all supposed to be listening to a Christmas broadcast
by Mrs. Weasley’s favorite singer, Celestina Warbeck, whose voice
was warbling out of the large wooden wireless set. Fleur, who seemed
to find Celestina very dull, was talking so loudly in the corner that a
scowling Mrs. Weasley kept pointing her wand at the volume control, so that Celestina grew louder and louder. Under cover of a particularly jazzy number called “A Cauldron Full of Hot, Strong
Love,” Fred and George started a game of Exploding Snap with
Ginny. Ron kept shooting Bill and Fleur covert looks, as though
hoping to pick up tips. Meanwhile, Remus Lupin, who was thinner
and more ragged-looking than ever, was sitting beside the fire, staring into its depths as though he could not hear Celestina’s voice.
Oh, come and stir my cauldron,
And if you do it right,
I’ll boil you up some hot strong love
To keep you warm tonight.
“We danced to this when we were eighteen!” said Mrs. Weasley,
wiping her eyes on her knitting. “Do you remember, Arthur?”
“Mphf?” said Mr. Weasley, whose head had been nodding over
the satsuma he was peeling. “Oh yes . . . marvelous tune . . .”
With an effort, he sat up a little straighter and looked around at
Harry, who was sitting next to him.


330



A VERY FROSTY
CHRISTMAS
“Sorry about this,” he said, jerking his head toward the wireless
as Celestina broke into the chorus. “Be over soon.”
“No problem,” said Harry, grinning. “Has it been busy at the
Ministry?”
“Very,” said Mr. Weasley. “I wouldn’t mind if we were getting
anywhere, but of the three arrests we’ve made in the last couple of
months, I doubt that one of them is a genuine Death Eater — only
don’t repeat that, Harry,” he added quickly, looking much more
awake all of a sudden.
“They’re not still holding Stan Shunpike, are they?” asked Harry.
“I’m afraid so,” said Mr. Weasley. “I know Dumbledore’s tried
appealing directly to Scrimgeour about Stan. . . . I mean, anybody
who has actually interviewed him agrees that he’s about as much a
Death Eater as this satsuma . . . but the top levels want to look as
though they’re making some progress, and ‘three arrests’ sounds
better than ‘three mistaken arrests and releases’. . . but again, this is
all top secret. . . .”
“I won’t say anything,” said Harry. He hesitated for a moment,
wondering how best to embark on what he wanted to say; as he
marshaled his thoughts, Celestina Warbeck began a ballad called
“You Charmed the Heart Right Out of Me.”
“Mr. Weasley, you know what I told you at the station when we
were setting off for school?”
“I checked, Harry,” said Mr. Weasley at once. “I went and
searched the Malfoys’ house. There was nothing, either broken or
whole, that shouldn’t have been there.”
“Yeah, I know, I saw in the Prophet that you’d looked . . . but this
is something different. . . . Well, something more . . .”
And he told Mr. Weasley everything he had overheard between


331



CHAPTER SIXTEEN
Malfoy and Snape. As Harry spoke, he saw Lupin’s head turn a little toward him, taking in every word. When he had finished, there
was silence, except for Celestina’s crooning.
Oh, my poor heart, where has it gone?
It’s left me for a spell . . .
“Has it occurred to you, Harry,” said Mr. Weasley, “that Snape
was simply pretending — ?”
“Pretending to offer help, so that he could find out what Malfoy’s up to?” said Harry quickly. “Yeah, I thought you’d say that.
But how do we know?”
“It isn’t our business to know,” said Lupin unexpectedly. He had
turned his back on the fire now and faced Harry across Mr.
Weasley. “It’s Dumbledore’s business. Dumbledore trusts Severus,
and that ought to be good enough for all of us.”
“But,” said Harry, “just say — just say Dumbledore’s wrong
about Snape —”
“People have said it, many times. It comes down to whether or
not you trust Dumbledore’s judgment. I do; therefore, I trust
Severus.”
“But Dumbledore can make mistakes,” argued Harry. “He says
it himself. And you” — he looked Lupin straight in the eye — “do
you honestly like Snape?”
“I neither like nor dislike Severus,” said Lupin. “No, Harry, I am
speaking the truth,” he added, as Harry pulled a skeptical expression. “We shall never be bosom friends, perhaps; after all that happened between James and Sirius and Severus, there is too much
bitterness there. But I do not forget that during the year I taught at


332



A VERY FROSTY
CHRISTMAS
Hogwarts, Severus made the Wolfsbane Potion for me every
month, made it perfectly, so that I did not have to suffer as I usually do at the full moon.”
“But he ‘accidentally’ let it slip that you’re a werewolf, so you had
to leave!” said Harry angrily.
Lupin shrugged. “The news would have leaked out anyway. We
both know he wanted my job, but he could have wreaked much
worse damage on me by tampering with the potion. He kept me
healthy. I must be grateful.”
“Maybe he didn’t dare mess with the potion with Dumbledore
watching him!” said Harry.
“You are determined to hate him, Harry,” said Lupin with a
faint smile. “And I understand; with James as your father, with Sirius as your godfather, you have inherited an old prejudice. By all
means tell Dumbledore what you have told Arthur and me, but do
not expect him to share your view of the matter; do not even expect
him to be surprised by what you tell him. It might have been on
Dumbledore’s orders that Severus questioned Draco.”
. . . and now you’ve torn it quite apart
I’ll thank you to give back my heart!
Celestina ended her song on a very long, high-pitched note and
loud applause issued out of the wireless, which Mrs. Weasley joined
in with enthusiastically.
“Eez eet over?” said Fleur loudly. “Thank goodness, what an ’orrible —”
“Shall we have a nightcap, then?” asked Mr. Weasley loudly,
leaping to his feet. “Who wants eggnog?”


333



CHAPTER SIXTEEN
“What have you been up to lately?” Harry asked Lupin, as Mr.
Weasley bustled off to fetch the eggnog, and everybody else
stretched and broke into conversation.
“Oh, I’ve been underground,” said Lupin. “Almost literally.
That’s why I haven’t been able to write, Harry; sending letters to
you would have been something of a giveaway.”
“What do you mean?”
“I’ve been living among my fellows, my equals,” said Lupin.
“Werewolves,” he added, at Harry’s look of incomprehension.
“Nearly all of them are on Voldemort’s side. Dumbledore wanted a
spy and here I was . . . ready-made.”
He sounded a little bitter, and perhaps realized it, for he smiled
more warmly as he went on, “I am not complaining; it is necessary
work and who can do it better than I? However, it has been difficult gaining their trust. I bear the unmistakable signs of having
tried to live among wizards, you see, whereas they have shunned
normal society and live on the margins, stealing — and sometimes
killing — to eat.”
“How come they like Voldemort?”
“They think that, under his rule, they will have a better life,”
said Lupin. “And it is hard to argue with Greyback out there. . . .”
“Who’s Greyback?”
“You haven’t heard of him?” Lupin’s hands closed convulsively in
his lap. “Fenrir Greyback is, perhaps, the most savage werewolf
alive today. He regards it as his mission in life to bite and to contaminate as many people as possible; he wants to create enough werewolves to overcome the wizards. Voldemort has promised him prey
in return for his services. Greyback specializes in children. . . . Bite
them young, he says, and raise them away from their parents, raise


334



A VERY FROSTY
CHRISTMAS
them to hate normal wizards. Voldemort has threatened to unleash
him upon people’s sons and daughters; it is a threat that usually
produces good results.”
Lupin paused and then said, “It was Greyback who bit me.”
“What?” said Harry, astonished. “When — when you were a
kid, you mean?”
“Yes. My father had offended him. I did not know, for a very
long time, the identity of the werewolf who had attacked me; I
even felt pity for him, thinking that he had had no control, knowing by then how it felt to transform. But Greyback is not like that.
At the full moon, he positions himself close to victims, ensuring
that he is near enough to strike. He plans it all. And this is the man
Voldemort is using to marshal the werewolves. I cannot pretend
that my particular brand of reasoned argument is making much
headway against Greyback’s insistence that we werewolves deserve
blood, that we ought to revenge ourselves on normal people.”
“But you are normal!” said Harry fiercely. “You’ve just got a — a
problem —”
Lupin burst out laughing. “Sometimes you remind me a lot of
James. He called it my ‘furry little problem’ in company. Many
people were under the impression that I owned a badly behaved
rabbit.”
He accepted a glass of eggnog from Mr. Weasley with a word of
thanks, looking slightly more cheerful. Harry, meanwhile, felt a
rush of excitement: This last mention of his father had reminded
him that there was something he had been looking forward to asking Lupin.
“Have you ever heard of someone called the Half-Blood Prince?”
“The Half-Blood what?”


CHAPTER SIXTEEN
“Prince,” said Harry, watching him closely for signs of recognition.
“There are no Wizarding princes,” said Lupin, now smiling. “Is
this a title you’re thinking of adopting? I should have thought being ‘the Chosen One’ would be enough.”
“It’s nothing to do with me!” said Harry indignantly. “The HalfBlood Prince is someone who used to go to Hogwarts, I’ve got his
old Potions book. He wrote spells all over it, spells he invented.
One of them was Levicorpus —”
“Oh, that one had a great vogue during my time at Hogwarts,”
said Lupin reminiscently. “There were a few months in my fifth
year when you couldn’t move for being hoisted into the air by your
ankle.”
“My dad used it,” said Harry. “I saw him in the Pensieve, he used
it on Snape.”
He tried to sound casual, as though this was a throwaway comment of no real importance, but he was not sure he had achieved
the right effect; Lupin’s smile was a little too understanding.
“Yes,” he said, “but he wasn’t the only one. As I say, it was very
popular. . . . You know how these spells come and go. . . .”
“But it sounds like it was invented while you were at school,”
Harry persisted.
“Not necessarily,” said Lupin. “Jinxes go in and out of fashion
like everything else.”
He looked into Harry’s face and then said quietly, “James was a
pureblood, Harry, and I promise you, he never asked us to call him
‘Prince.’ ”
Abandoning pretense, Harry said, “And it wasn’t Sirius? Or you?”



A VERY FROSTY

“Definitely not.”
“Oh.” Harry stared into the fire. “I just thought — well, he’s
helped me out a lot in Potions classes, the Prince has.”
“How old is this book, Harry?”
“I dunno, I’ve never checked.”
“Well, perhaps that will give you some clue as to when the
Prince was at Hogwarts,” said Lupin.
Shortly after this, Fleur decided to imitate Celestina singing “A
Cauldron Full of Hot, Strong Love,” which was taken by everyone,
once they had glimpsed Mrs. Weasley’s expression, to be the cue to
go to bed. Harry and Ron climbed all the way up to Ron’s attic
bedroom, where a camp bed had been added for Harry.
Ron fell asleep almost immediately, but Harry delved into his
trunk and pulled out his copy of Advanced Potion-Making before
getting into bed. There he turned its pages, searching, until he
finally found, at the front of the book, the date that it had been published. It was nearly fifty years old. Neither his father, nor his father’s
friends, had been at Hogwarts fifty years ago. Feeling disappointed,
Harry threw the book back into his trunk, turned off the lamp, and
rolled over, thinking of werewolves and Snape, Stan Shunpike and
the Half-Blood Prince, and finally falling into an uneasy sleep full of
creeping shadows and the cries of bitten children. . . .
“She’s got to be joking. . . .”
Harry woke with a start to find a bulging stocking lying over the
end of his bed. He put on his glasses and looked around; the tiny
window was almost completely obscured with snow and, in front
of it, Ron was sitting bolt upright in bed and examining what appeared to be a thick gold chain.



337

CHAPTER SIXTEEN
“What’s that?” asked Harry.
“It’s from Lavender,” said Ron, sounding revolted. “She can’t
honestly think I’d wear . . .”
Harry looked more closely and let out a shout of laughter. Dangling from the chain in large gold letters were the words:

My Sweet heart
“Nice,” he said. “Classy. You should definitely wear it in front of
Fred and George.”
“If you tell them,” said Ron, shoving the necklace out of sight
under his pillow, “I — I — I’ll —”
“Stutter at me?” said Harry, grinning. “Come on, would I?”
“How could she think I’d like something like that, though?”
Ron demanded of thin air, looking rather shocked.
“Well, think back,” said Harry. “Have you ever let it slip that
you’d like to go out in public with the words ‘My Sweetheart’
round your neck?”
“Well . . . we don’t really talk much,” said Ron. “It’s mainly . . .”
“Snogging,” said Harry.
“Well, yeah,” said Ron. He hesitated a moment, then said, “Is
Hermione really going out with McLaggen?”
“I dunno,” said Harry. “They were at Slughorn’s party together,
but I don’t think it went that well.”
Ron looked slightly more cheerful as he delved deeper into his
stocking.
Harry’s presents included a sweater with a large Golden Snitch
worked onto the front, hand-knitted by Mrs. Weasley, a large box
of Weasleys’ Wizard Wheezes products from the twins, and a


338



A VERY FROSTY
CHRISTMAS
slightly damp, moldy-smelling package that came with a label reading To Master, From Kreacher.
Harry stared at it. “D’you reckon this is safe to open?” he asked.
“Can’t be anything dangerous, all our mail’s still being searched
at the Ministry,” replied Ron, though he was eyeing the parcel
suspiciously.
“I didn’t think of giving Kreacher anything. Do people usually
give their house-elves Christmas presents?” asked Harry, prodding
the parcel cautiously.
“Hermione would,” said Ron. “But let’s wait and see what it is
before you start feeling guilty.”
A moment later, Harry had given a loud yell and leapt out of his
camp bed; the package contained a large number of maggots.
“Nice,” said Ron, roaring with laughter. “Very thoughtful.”
“I’d rather have them than that necklace,” said Harry, which
sobered Ron up at once.
Everybody was wearing new sweaters when they all sat down for
Christmas lunch, everyone except Fleur (on whom, it appeared,
Mrs. Weasley had not wanted to waste one) and Mrs. Weasley
herself, who was sporting a brand-new midnight blue witch’s hat
glittering with what looked like tiny starlike diamonds, and a spectacular golden necklace.
“Fred and George gave them to me! Aren’t they beautiful?”
“Well, we find we appreciate you more and more, Mum, now
we’re washing our own socks,” said George, waving an airy hand.
“Parsnips, Remus?”
“Harry, you’ve got a maggot in your hair,” said Ginny cheerfully,
leaning across the table to pick it out; Harry felt goose bumps erupt
up his neck that had nothing to do with the maggot.

CHAPTER SIXTEEN
“ ’Ow ’orrible,” said Fleur, with an affected little shudder.
“Yes, isn’t it?” said Ron. “Gravy, Fleur?”
In his eagerness to help her, he knocked the gravy boat flying;
Bill waved his wand and the gravy soared up in the air and returned
meekly to the boat.
“You are as bad as zat Tonks,” said Fleur to Ron, when she had
finished kissing Bill in thanks. “She is always knocking —”
“I invited dear Tonks to come along today,” said Mrs. Weasley,
setting down the carrots with unnecessary force and glaring at Fleur.
“But she wouldn’t come. Have you spoken to her lately, Remus?”
“No, I haven’t been in contact with anybody very much,” said
Lupin. “But Tonks has got her own family to go to, hasn’t she?”
“Hmmm,” said Mrs. Weasley. “Maybe. I got the impression she
was planning to spend Christmas alone, actually.”
She gave Lupin an annoyed look, as though it was all his fault
she was getting Fleur for a daughter-in-law instead of Tonks, but
Harry, glancing across at Fleur, who was now feeding Bill bits of
turkey off her own fork, thought that Mrs. Weasley was fighting a
long-lost battle. He was, however, reminded of a question he had
with regard to Tonks, and who better to ask than Lupin, the man
who knew all about Patronuses?
“Tonks’s Patronus has changed its form,” he told him. “Snape
said so anyway. I didn’t know that could happen. Why would your
Patronus change?”
Lupin took his time chewing his turkey and swallowing before
saying slowly, “Sometimes . . . a great shock . . . an emotional upheaval . . .”
“It looked big, and it had four legs,” said Harry, struck by a sudden thought and lowering his voice. “Hey . . . it couldn’t be — ?”


A VERY FROSTY
CHRISTMAS
“Arthur!” said Mrs. Weasley suddenly. She had risen from her
chair; her hand was pressed over her heart and she was staring out
of the kitchen window. “Arthur — it’s Percy!”
“What?”
Mr. Weasley looked around. Everybody looked quickly at the
window; Ginny stood up for a better look. There, sure enough, was
Percy Weasley, striding across the snowy yard, his horn-rimmed
glasses glinting in the sunlight. He was not, however, alone.
“Arthur, he’s — he’s with the Minister!”
And sure enough, the man Harry had seen in the Daily Prophet
was following along in Percy’s wake, limping slightly, his mane of
graying hair and his black cloak flecked with snow. Before any of
them could say anything, before Mr. and Mrs. Weasley could do
more than exchange stunned looks, the back door opened and
there stood Percy.
There was a moment’s painful silence. Then Percy said rather
stiffly, “Merry Christmas, Mother.”
“Oh, Percy!” said Mrs. Weasley, and she threw herself into his
arms.
Rufus Scrimgeour paused in the doorway, leaning on his walking stick and smiling as he observed this affecting scene.
“You must forgive this intrusion,” he said, when Mrs. Weasley
looked around at him, beaming and wiping her eyes. “Percy and I
were in the vicinity — working, you know — and he couldn’t resist dropping in and seeing you all.”
But Percy showed no sign of wanting to greet any of the rest of
the family. He stood, poker-straight and awkward-looking, and
stared over everybody else’s heads. Mr. Weasley, Fred, and George
were all observing him, stony-faced.


CHAPTER SIXTEEN
“Please, come in, sit down, Minister!” fluttered Mrs. Weasley,
straightening her hat. “Have a little purkey, or some tooding. . . . I
mean —”
“No, no, my dear Molly,” said Scrimgeour. Harry guessed that
he had checked her name with Percy before they entered the house.
“I don’t want to intrude, wouldn’t be here at all if Percy hadn’t
wanted to see you all so badly. . . .”
“Oh, Perce!” said Mrs. Weasley tearfully, reaching up to kiss
him.
“. . . We’ve only looked in for five minutes, so I’ll have a stroll
around the yard while you catch up with Percy. No, no, I assure
you I don’t want to butt in! Well, if anybody cared to show me your
charming garden . . . Ah, that young man’s finished, why doesn’t
he take a stroll with me?”
The atmosphere around the table changed perceptibly. Everybody looked from Scrimgeour to Harry. Nobody seemed to find
Scrimgeour s pretense that he did not know Harry’s name convincing, or find it natural that he should be chosen to accompany the
Minister around the garden when Ginny, Fleur, and George also
had clean plates.
“Yeah, all right,” said Harry into the silence.
He was not fooled; for all Scrimgeour’s talk that they had just
been in the area, that Percy wanted to look up his family, this must
be the real reason that they had come, so that Scrimgeour could
speak to Harry alone.
“It’s fine,” he said quietly, as he passed Lupin, who had half risen
from his chair. “Fine,” he added, as Mr. Weasley opened his mouth
to speak.
“Wonderful!” said Scrimgeour, standing back to let Harry pass


342

A VERY FROSTY
CHRISTMAS
through the door ahead of him. “We’ll just take a turn around the
garden, and Percy and I’ll be off. Carry on, everyone!”
Harry walked across the yard toward the Weasleys’ overgrown,
snow-covered garden, Scrimgeour limping slightly at his side. He
had, Harry knew, been Head of the Auror office; he looked tough
and battle-scarred, very different from portly Fudge in his bowler
hat.
“Charming,” said Scrimgeour, stopping at the garden fence and
looking out over the snowy lawn and the indistinguishable plants.
“Charming.”
Harry said nothing. He could tell that Scrimgeour was watching
him.
“I’ve wanted to meet you for a very long time,” said Scrimgeour,
after a few moments. “Did you know that?”
“No,” said Harry truthfully.
“Oh yes, for a very long time. But Dumbledore has been very
protective of you,” said Scrimgeour. “Natural, of course, natural,
after what you’ve been through. . . . Especially what happened at
the Ministry . . .”
He waited for Harry to say something, but Harry did not oblige,
so he went on, “I have been hoping for an occasion to talk to you
ever since I gained office, but Dumbledore has — most understandably, as I say — prevented this.”
Still, Harry said nothing, waiting.
“The rumors that have flown around!” said Scrimgeour. “Well,
of course, we both know how these stories get distorted . . . all these
whispers of a prophecy . . . of you being ‘the Chosen One’. . .”
They were getting near it now, Harry thought, the reason Scrimgeour was here.


343



CHAPTER SIXTEEN
“. . . I assume that Dumbledore has discussed these matters with
you?”
Harry deliberated, wondering whether he ought to lie or not.
He looked at the little gnome prints all around the flowerbeds, and
the scuffed-up patch that marked the spot where Fred had caught
the gnome now wearing the tutu at the top of the Christmas tree.
Finally, he decided on the truth . . . or a bit of it.
“Yeah, we’ve discussed it.”
“Have you, have you . . .” said Scrimgeour. Harry could see, out
of the corner of his eye, Scrimgeour squinting at him, so he pretended to be very interested in a gnome that had just poked its
head out from underneath a frozen rhododendron. “And what has
Dumbledore told you, Harry?”
“Sorry, but that’s between us,” said Harry. He kept his voice as
pleasant as he could, and Scrimgeour’s tone, too, was light and
friendly as he said, “Oh, of course, if it’s a question of confidences,
I wouldn’t want you to divulge . . . no, no . . . and in any case, does
it really matter whether you are ‘the Chosen One’ or not?”
Harry had to mull that one over for a few seconds before responding. “I don’t really know what you mean, Minister.”
“Well, of course, to you it will matter enormously,” said Scrimgeour with a laugh. “But to the Wizarding community at large . . .
it’s all perception, isn’t it? It’s what people believe that’s important.”
Harry said nothing. He thought he saw, dimly, where they were
heading, but he was not going to help Scrimgeour get there. The
gnome under the rhododendron was now digging for worms at its
roots, and Harry kept his eyes fixed upon it.
“People believe you are ‘the Chosen One,’ you see,” said Scrimgeour. “They think you quite the hero — which, of course, you


344



A VERY FROSTY
CHRISTMAS
are, Harry, chosen or not! How many times have you faced HeWho-Must-Not-Be-Named now? Well, anyway,” he pressed on,
without waiting for a reply, “the point is, you are a symbol of hope
for many, Harry. The idea that there is somebody out there who
might be able, who might even be destined, to destroy He-WhoMust-Not-Be-Named — well, naturally, it gives people a lift. And
I can’t help but feel that, once you realize this, you might consider
it, well, almost a duty, to stand alongside the Ministry, and give
everyone a boost.”
The gnome had just managed to get hold of a worm. It was now
tugging very hard on it, trying to get it out of the frozen ground.
Harry was silent so long that Scrimgeour said, looking from Harry
to the gnome, “Funny little chaps, aren’t they? But what say you,
Harry?”
“I don’t exactly understand what you want,” said Harry slowly.
“ ‘Stand alongside the Ministry’ . . . What does that mean?”
“Oh, well, nothing at all onerous, I assure you,” said Scrimgeour. “If you were to be seen popping in and out of the Ministry
from time to time, for instance, that would give the right impression. And of course, while you were there, you would have ample
opportunity to speak to Gawain Robards, my successor as Head of
the Auror office. Dolores Umbridge has told me that you cherish
an ambition to become an Auror. Well, that could be arranged very
easily. . . .”
Harry felt anger bubbling in the pit of his stomach: So Dolores
Umbridge was still at the Ministry, was she?
“So basically,” he said, as though he just wanted to clarify a few
points, “you’d like to give the impression that I’m working for the
Ministry?”


345



CHAPTER SIXTEEN
“It would give everyone a lift to think you were more involved,
Harry,” said Scrimgeour, sounding relieved that Harry had cottoned on so quickly. “ ‘The Chosen One,’ you know . . . It’s all
about giving people hope, the feeling that exciting things are happening. . . .”
“But if I keep running in and out of the Ministry,” said Harry,
still endeavoring to keep his voice friendly, “won’t that seem as
though I approve of what the Ministry’s up to?”
“Well,” said Scrimgeour, frowning slightly, “well, yes, that’s
partly why we’d like —”
“No, I don’t think that’ll work,” said Harry pleasantly. “You see,
I don’t like some of the things the Ministry’s doing. Locking up
Stan Shunpike, for instance.”
Scrimgeour did not speak for a moment but his expression hardened instantly. “I would not expect you to understand,” he said,
and he was not as successful at keeping anger out of his voice as
Harry had been. “These are dangerous times, and certain measures
need to be taken. You are sixteen years old —”
“Dumbledore’s a lot older than sixteen, and he doesn’t think
Stan should be in Azkaban either,” said Harry. “You’re making Stan
a scapegoat, just like you want to make me a mascot.”
They looked at each other, long and hard. Finally Scrimgeour
said, with no pretense at warmth, “I see. You prefer — like your
hero, Dumbledore — to disassociate yourself from the Ministry?”
“I don’t want to be used,” said Harry.
“Some would say it’s your duty to be used by the Ministry!”
“Yeah, and others might say it’s your duty to check that people
really are Death Eaters before you chuck them in prison,” said
Harry, his temper rising now. “You’re doing what Barty Crouch


346



A VERY FROSTY
CHRISTMAS
did. You never get it right, you people, do you? Either we’ve got
Fudge, pretending everything’s lovely while people get murdered
right under his nose, or we’ve got you, chucking the wrong people
into jail and trying to pretend you’ve got ‘the Chosen One’ working for you!”
“So you’re not ‘the Chosen One’?” said Scrimgeour.
“I thought you said it didn’t matter either way?” said Harry, with
a bitter laugh. “Not to you anyway.”
“I shouldn’t have said that,” said Scrimgeour quickly. “It was
tactless —”
“No, it was honest,” said Harry. “One of the only honest things
you’ve said to me. You don’t care whether I live or die, but you do
care that I help you convince everyone you’re winning the war
against Voldemort. I haven’t forgotten, Minister. . . .”
He raised his right fist. There, shining white on the back of his
cold hand, were the scars which Dolores Umbridge had forced him
to carve into his own flesh: I must not tell lies.
“I don’t remember you rushing to my defense when I was trying
to tell everyone Voldemort was back. The Ministry wasn’t so keen
to be pals last year.”
They stood in silence as icy as the ground beneath their feet. The
gnome had finally managed to extricate his worm and was now
sucking on it happily, leaning against the bottommost branches of
the rhododendron bush.
“What is Dumbledore up to?” said Scrimgeour brusquely.
“Where does he go when he is absent from Hogwarts?”
“No idea,” said Harry.
“And you wouldn’t tell me if you knew,” said Scrimgeour,
“would you?”


347



CHAPTER SIXTEEN
“No, I wouldn’t,” said Harry.
“Well, then, I shall have to see whether I can’t find out by other
means.”
“You can try,” said Harry indifferently. “But you seem cleverer
than Fudge, so I’d have thought you’d have learned from his mistakes. He tried interfering at Hogwarts. You might have noticed
he’s not Minister anymore, but Dumbledore’s still headmaster. I’d
leave Dumbledore alone, if I were you.”
There was a long pause.
“Well, it is clear to me that he has done a very good job on you,”
said Scrimgeour, his eyes cold and hard behind his wire-rimmed
glasses. “Dumbledore’s man through and through, aren’t you, Potter?”
“Yeah, I am,” said Harry. “Glad we straightened that out.”
And turning his back on the Minister of Magic, he strode back
toward the house.

ate in the afternoon, a few days after New Year, Harry, Ron,
and Ginny lined up beside the kitchen fire to return to Hogwarts. The Ministry had arranged this one-off connection to the
Floo Network to return students quickly and safely to the school.
Only Mrs. Weasley was there to say good-bye, as Mr. Weasley,
Fred, George, Bill, and Fleur were all at work. Mrs. Weasley dissolved into tears at the moment of parting. Admittedly, it took very
little to set her off lately; she had been crying on and off ever since
Percy had stormed from the house on Christmas Day with his
glasses splattered with mashed parsnip (for which Fred, George,
and Ginny all claimed credit).
“Don’t cry, Mum,” said Ginny, patting her on the back as Mrs.
Weasley sobbed into her shoulder. “It’s okay. . . .”
“Yeah, don’t worry about us,” said Ron, permitting his mother
to plant a very wet kiss on his cheek, “or about Percy. He’s such a
prat, it’s not really a loss, is it?”


349



CHAPTER SEVENTEEN
Mrs. Weasley sobbed harder than ever as she enfolded Harry in
her arms.
“Promise me you’ll look after yourself. . . . Stay out of trouble. . . .”
“I always do, Mrs. Weasley,” said Harry. “I like a quiet life, you
know me.”
She gave a watery chuckle and stood back. “Be good, then, all of
you. . . .”
Harry stepped into the emerald fire and shouted “Hogwarts!”
He had one last fleeting view of the Weasleys’ kitchen and Mrs.
Weasley’s tearful face before the flames engulfed him; spinning very
fast, he caught blurred glimpses of other Wizarding rooms, which
were whipped out of sight before he could get a proper look; then
he was slowing down, finally stopping squarely in the fireplace in
Professor McGonagall’s office. She barely glanced up from her
work as he clambered out over the grate.
“Evening, Potter. Try not to get too much ash on the carpet.”
“No, Professor.”
Harry straightened his glasses and flattened his hair as Ron came
spinning into view. When Ginny had arrived, all three of them
trooped out of McGonagall’s office and off toward Gryffindor
Tower. Harry glanced out of the corridor windows as they passed;
the sun was already sinking over grounds carpeted in deeper snow
than had lain over the Burrow garden. In the distance, he could see
Hagrid feeding Buckbeak in front of his cabin.
“Baubles,” said Ron confidently, when they reached the Fat
Lady, who was looking rather paler than usual and winced at his
loud voice.
“No,” she said.


A SLUGGISH MEMORY
“What d’you mean, ‘no’?”
“There is a new password,” she said. “And please don’t shout.”
“But we’ve been away, how’re we supposed to — ?”
“Harry! Ginny!”
Hermione was hurrying toward them, very pink-faced and wearing a cloak, hat, and gloves.
“I got back a couple of hours ago, I’ve just been down to visit
Hagrid and Buck — I mean Witherwings,” she said breathlessly.
“Did you have a good Christmas?”
“Yeah,” said Ron at once, “pretty eventful, Rufus Scrim —”
“I’ve got something for you, Harry,” said Hermione, neither
looking at Ron nor giving any sign that she had heard him. “Oh,
hang on — password. Abstinence.”
“Precisely,” said the Fat Lady in a feeble voice, and swung forward to reveal the portrait hole.
“What’s up with her?” asked Harry.
“Overindulged over Christmas, apparently,” said Hermione,
rolling her eyes as she led the way into the packed common room.
“She and her friend Violet drank their way through all the wine
in that picture of drunk monks down by the Charms corridor.
Anyway . . .”
She rummaged in her pocket for a moment, then pulled out a
scroll of parchment with Dumbledore’s writing on it.
“Great,” said Harry, unrolling it at once to discover that his next
lesson with Dumbledore was scheduled for the following night.
“I’ve got loads to tell him — and you. Let’s sit down —”
But at that moment there was a loud squeal of “Won-Won!” and
Lavender Brown came hurtling out of nowhere and flung herself
into Ron’s arms. Several onlookers sniggered; Hermione gave a


351



CHAPTER SEVENTEEN
tinkling laugh and said, “There’s a table over here. . . . Coming,
Ginny?”
“No, thanks, I said I’d meet Dean,” said Ginny, though Harry
could not help noticing that she did not sound very enthusiastic.
Leaving Ron and Lavender locked in a kind of vertical wrestling
match, Harry led Hermione over to the spare table.
“So how was your Christmas?”
“Oh, fine,” she shrugged. “Nothing special. How was it at WonWon’s?”
“I’ll tell you in a minute,” said Harry. “Look, Hermione, can’t
you — ?”
“No, I can’t,” she said flatly. “So don’t even ask.”
“I thought maybe, you know, over Christmas —”
“It was the Fat Lady who drank a vat of five-hundred-year-old
wine, Harry, not me. So what was this important news you wanted
to tell me?”
She looked too fierce to argue with at that moment, so Harry
dropped the subject of Ron and recounted all that he had overheard
between Malfoy and Snape. When he had finished, Hermione sat in
thought for a moment and then said, “Don’t you think — ?”
“— he was pretending to offer help so that he could trick Malfoy into telling him what he’s doing?”
“Well, yes,” said Hermione.
“Ron’s dad and Lupin think so,” Harry said grudgingly. “But
this definitely proves Malfoy’s planning something, you can’t deny
that.”
“No, I can’t,” she answered slowly.
“And he’s acting on Voldemort’s orders, just like I said!”



352



A SLUGGISH MEMORY
“Hmm . . . did either of them actually mention Voldemort’s
name?”
Harry frowned, trying to remember. “I’m not sure . . . Snape
definitely said ‘your master,’ and who else would that be?”
“I don’t know,” said Hermione, biting her lip. “Maybe his
father?”
She stared across the room, apparently lost in thought, not even
noticing Lavender tickling Ron. “How’s Lupin?”
“Not great,” said Harry, and he told her all about Lupin’s mission
among the werewolves and the difficulties he was facing. “Have you
heard of this Fenrir Greyback?”
“Yes, I have!” said Hermione, sounding startled. “And so have
you, Harry!”
“When, History of Magic? You know full well I never listened . . .”
“No, no, not History of Magic — Malfoy threatened Borgin
with him!” said Hermione. “Back in Knockturn Alley, don’t you remember? He told Borgin that Greyback was an old family friend
and that he’d be checking up on Borgin’s progress!”
Harry gaped at her. “I forgot! But this proves Malfoy’s a Death
Eater, how else could he be in contact with Greyback and telling
him what to do?”
“It is pretty suspicious,” breathed Hermione. “Unless . . .”
“Oh, come on,” said Harry in exasperation, “you can’t get round
this one!”
“Well . . . there is the possibility it was an empty threat.”
“You’re unbelievable, you are,” said Harry, shaking his head.
“We’ll see who’s right. . . . You’ll be eating your words, Hermione,

just like the Ministry. Oh yeah, I had a row with Rufus Scrimgeour
as well. . . .”
And the rest of the evening passed amicably with both of them
abusing the Minister of Magic, for Hermione, like Ron, thought
that after all the Ministry had put Harry through the previous year,
they had a great deal of nerve asking him for help now.
The new term started next morning with a pleasant surprise for
the sixth years: a large sign had been pinned to the common room
notice boards overnight.

Harry and Ron joined the crowd that was jostling around the
notice and taking it in turns to write their names at the bottom.
Ron was just taking out his quill to sign after Hermione when
Lavender crept up behind him, slipped her hands over his eyes, and
trilled, “Guess who, Won-Won?” Harry turned to see Hermione
stalking off; he caught up with her, having no wish to stay behind
with Ron and Lavender, but to his surprise, Ron caught up with
them only a little way beyond the portrait hole, his ears bright red
and his expression disgruntled. Without a word, Hermione sped
up to walk with Neville.
“So — Apparition,” said Ron, his tone making it perfectly plain



that Harry was not to mention what had just happened. “Should
be a laugh, eh?”
“I dunno,” said Harry. “Maybe it’s better when you do it yourself, I didn’t enjoy it much when Dumbledore took me along for
the ride.”
“I forgot you’d already done it. . . . I’d better pass my test first
time,” said Ron, looking anxious. “Fred and George did.”
“Charlie failed, though, didn’t he?”
“Yeah, but Charlie’s bigger than me” — Ron held his arms out
from his body as though he was a gorilla — “so Fred and George
didn’t go on about it much . . . not to his face anyway . . .”
“When can we take the actual test?”
“Soon as we’re seventeen. That’s only March for me!”
“Yeah, but you wouldn’t be able to Apparate in here, not in the
castle . . .”
“Not the point, is it? Everyone would know I could Apparate if I
wanted.”
Ron was not the only one to be excited at the prospect of Apparition. All that day there was much talk about the forthcoming
lessons; a great deal of store was set by being able to vanish and
reappear at will.
“How cool will it be when we can just —” Seamus clicked his
fingers to indicate disappearance. “Me cousin Fergus does it just to
annoy me, you wait till I can do it back . . . He’ll never have another peaceful moment. . . .”
Lost in visions of this happy prospect, he flicked his wand a little too enthusiastically, so that instead of producing the fountain of
pure water that was the object of today’s Charms lesson, he let out



CHAPTER SEVENTEEN
a hoselike jet that ricocheted off the ceiling and knocked Professor
Flitwick flat on his face.
“Harry’s already Apparated,” Ron told a slightly abashed Seamus, after Professor Flitwick had dried himself off with a wave of
his wand and set Seamus lines: “I am a wizard, not a baboon brandishing a stick.” “Dum — er — someone took him. Side-AlongApparition, you know.”
“Whoa!” whispered Seamus, and he, Dean, and Neville put their
heads a little closer to hear what Apparition felt like. For the rest of
the day, Harry was besieged with requests from the other sixth
years to describe the sensation of Apparition. All of them seemed
awed, rather than put off, when he told them how uncomfortable
it was, and he was still answering detailed questions at ten to eight
that evening, when he was forced to lie and say that he needed to
return a book to the library, so as to escape in time for his lesson
with Dumbledore.
The lamps in Dumbledore’s office were lit, the portraits of previous headmasters were snoring gently in their frames, and the Pensieve was ready upon the desk once more. Dumbledore’s hands lay
on either side of it, the right one as blackened and burnt-looking as
ever. It did not seem to have healed at all and Harry wondered, for
perhaps the hundredth time, what had caused such a distinctive injury, but did not ask; Dumbledore had said that he would know
eventually and there was, in any case, another subject he wanted to
discuss. But before Harry could say anything about Snape and
Malfoy, Dumbledore spoke.
“I hear that you met the Minister of Magic over Christmas?”
“Yes,” said Harry. “He’s not very happy with me.”



356



A SLUGGISH MEMORY
“No,” sighed Dumbledore. “He is not very happy with me
either. We must try not to sink beneath our anguish, Harry, but
battle on.”
Harry grinned.
“He wanted me to tell the Wizarding community that the Ministry’s doing a wonderful job.”
Dumbledore smiled.
“It was Fudge’s idea originally, you know. During his last days in
office, when he was trying desperately to cling to his post, he
sought a meeting with you, hoping that you would give him your
support —”
“After everything Fudge did last year?” said Harry angrily. “After
Umbridge?”
“I told Cornelius there was no chance of it, but the idea did not
die when he left office. Within hours of Scrimgeour’s appointment
we met and he demanded that I arrange a meeting with you —”
“So that’s why you argued!” Harry blurted out. “It was in the
Daily Prophet.”
“The Prophet is bound to report the truth occasionally,” said
Dumbledore, “if only accidentally. Yes, that was why we argued.
Well, it appears that Rufus found a way to corner you at last.”
“He accused me of being ‘Dumbledore’s man through and
through.’ ”
“How very rude of him.”
“I told him I was.”
Dumbledore opened his mouth to speak and then closed it
again. Behind Harry, Fawkes the phoenix let out a low, soft, musical cry. To Harry’s intense embarrassment, he suddenly realized



357



CHAPTER SEVENTEEN
that Dumbledore’s bright blue eyes looked rather watery, and
stared hastily at his own knees. When Dumbledore spoke, however, his voice was quite steady.
“I am very touched, Harry.”
“Scrimgeour wanted to know where you go when you’re not at
Hogwarts,” said Harry, still looking fixedly at his knees.
“Yes, he is very nosy about that,” said Dumbledore, now sounding cheerful, and Harry thought it safe to look up again. “He has
even attempted to have me followed. Amusing, really. He set
Dawlish to tail me. It wasn’t kind. I have already been forced to jinx
Dawlish once; I did it again with the greatest regret.”
“So they still don’t know where you go?” asked Harry, hoping for
more information on this intriguing subject, but Dumbledore
merely smiled over the top of his half-moon spectacles.
“No, they don’t, and the time is not quite right for you to know
either. Now, I suggest we press on, unless there’s anything else — ?”
“There is, actually, sir,” said Harry. “It’s about Malfoy and
Snape.”
“Professor Snape, Harry.”
“Yes, sir. I overheard them during Professor Slughorn’s party . . .
well, I followed them, actually. . . .”
Dumbledore listened to Harry’s story with an impassive face.
When Harry had finished he did not speak for a few moments,
then said, “Thank you for telling me this, Harry, but I suggest that
you put it out of your mind. I do not think that it is of great
importance.”
“Not of great importance?” repeated Harry incredulously. “Professor, did you understand — ?”
“Yes, Harry, blessed as I am with extraordinary brainpower, I


358



A SLUGGISH MEMORY
understood everything you told me,” said Dumbledore, a little
sharply. “I think you might even consider the possibility that I understood more than you did. Again, I am glad that you have confided in me, but let me reassure you that you have not told me
anything that causes me disquiet.”
Harry sat in seething silence, glaring at Dumbledore. What was
going on? Did this mean that Dumbledore had indeed ordered
Snape to find out what Malfoy was doing, in which case he had
already heard everything Harry had just told him from Snape? Or
was he really worried by what he had heard, but pretending not
to be?
“So, sir,” said Harry, in what he hoped was a polite, calm voice,
“you definitely still trust — ?”
“I have been tolerant enough to answer that question already,”
said Dumbledore, but he did not sound very tolerant anymore.
“My answer has not changed.”
“I should think not,” said a snide voice; Phineas Nigellus was evidently only pretending to be asleep. Dumbledore ignored him.
“And now, Harry, I must insist that we press on. I have more important things to discuss with you this evening.”
Harry sat there feeling mutinous. How would it be if he refused
to permit the change of subject, if he insisted upon arguing the case
against Malfoy? As though he had read Harry’s mind, Dumbledore
shook his head.
“Ah, Harry, how often this happens, even between the best of
friends! Each of us believes that what he has to say is much more
important than anything the other might have to contribute!”
“I don’t think what you’ve got to say is unimportant, sir,” said
Harry stiffly.


359



CHAPTER SEVENTEEN
“Well, you are quite right, because it is not,” said Dumbledore
briskly. “I have two more memories to show you this evening, both
obtained with enormous difficulty, and the second of them is, I
think, the most important I have collected.”
Harry did not say anything to this; he still felt angry at the reception his confidences had received, but could not see what was to
be gained by arguing further.
“So,” said Dumbledore, in a ringing voice, “we meet this evening to continue the tale of Tom Riddle, whom we left last lesson
poised on the threshold of his years at Hogwarts. You will remember how excited he was to hear that he was a wizard, that he refused
my company on a trip to Diagon Alley, and that I, in turn, warned
him against continued thievery when he arrived at school.
“Well, the start of the school year arrived and with it came Tom
Riddle, a quiet boy in his secondhand robes, who lined up with the
other first years to be sorted. He was placed in Slytherin House almost the moment that the Sorting Hat touched his head,” continued Dumbledore, waving his blackened hand toward the shelf over
his head where the Sorting Hat sat, ancient and unmoving. “How
soon Riddle learned that the famous founder of the House could
talk to snakes, I do not know — perhaps that very evening. The
knowledge can only have excited him and increased his sense of
self-importance.
“However, if he was frightening or impressing fellow Slytherins
with displays of Parseltongue in their common room, no hint of it
reached the staff. He showed no sign of outward arrogance or aggression at all. As an unusually talented and very good-looking orphan, he naturally drew attention and sympathy from the staff
almost from the moment of his arrival. He seemed polite, quiet,


360



A SLUGGISH MEMORY
and thirsty for knowledge. Nearly all were most favorably impressed by him.”
“Didn’t you tell them, sir, what he’d been like when you met him
at the orphanage?” asked Harry.
“No, I did not. Though he had shown no hint of remorse, it was
possible that he felt sorry for how he had behaved before and was
resolved to turn over a fresh leaf. I chose to give him that chance.”
Dumbledore paused and looked inquiringly at Harry, who had
opened his mouth to speak. Here, again, was Dumbledore’s tendency to trust people in spite of overwhelming evidence that they
did not deserve it! But then Harry remembered something. . . .
“But you didn’t really trust him, sir, did you? He told me . . . the
Riddle who came out of that diary said, ‘Dumbledore never
seemed to like me as much as the other teachers did.’ ”
“Let us say that I did not take it for granted that he was trustworthy,” said Dumbledore. “I had, as I have already indicated, resolved to keep a close eye upon him, and so I did. I cannot pretend
that I gleaned a great deal from my observations at first. He was
very guarded with me; he felt, I am sure, that in the thrill of discovering his true identity he had told me a little too much. He was
careful never to reveal as much again, but he could not take back
what he had let slip in his excitement, nor what Mrs. Cole had confided in me. However, he had the sense never to try and charm me
as he charmed so many of my colleagues.
“As he moved up the school, he gathered about him a group
of dedicated friends; I call them that, for want of a better term,
although as I have already indicated, Riddle undoubtedly felt no
affection for any of them. This group had a kind of dark glamour
within the castle. They were a motley collection; a mixture of the


361



CHAPTER SEVENTEEN
weak seeking protection, the ambitious seeking some shared glory,
and the thuggish gravitating toward a leader who could show them
more refined forms of cruelty. In other words, they were the forerunners of the Death Eaters, and indeed some of them became the
first Death Eaters after leaving Hogwarts.
“Rigidly controlled by Riddle, they were never detected in open
wrongdoing, although their seven years at Hogwarts were marked
by a number of nasty incidents to which they were never satisfactorily linked, the most serious of which was, of course, the opening
of the Chamber of Secrets, which resulted in the death of a girl. As
you know, Hagrid was wrongly accused of that crime.
“I have not been able to find many memories of Riddle at Hogwarts,” said Dumbledore, placing his withered hand on the Pensieve. “Few who knew him then are prepared to talk about him;
they are too terrified. What I know, I found out after he had left
Hogwarts, after much painstaking effort, after tracing those few
who could be tricked into speaking, after searching old records and
questioning Muggle and wizard witnesses alike.
“Those whom I could persuade to talk told me that Riddle was
obsessed with his parentage. This is understandable, of course; he
had grown up in an orphanage and naturally wished to know how
he came to be there. It seems that he searched in vain for some trace
of Tom Riddle senior on the shields in the trophy room, on the
lists of prefects in the old school records, even in the books of Wizarding history. Finally he was forced to accept that his father had
never set foot in Hogwarts. I believe that it was then that he
dropped the name forever, assumed the identity of Lord Voldemort, and began his investigations into his previously despised

362

A SLUGGISH MEMORY
mother’s family — the woman whom, you will remember, he had
thought could not be a witch if she had succumbed to the shameful human weakness of death.
“All he had to go upon was the single name ‘Marvolo,’ which he
knew from those who ran the orphanage had been his mother’s father’s name. Finally, after painstaking research through old books
of Wizarding families, he discovered the existence of Slytherin’s
surviving line. In the summer of his sixteenth year, he left the orphanage to which he returned annually and set off to find his
Gaunt relatives. And now, Harry, if you will stand . . .”
Dumbledore rose, and Harry saw that he was again holding a
small crystal bottle filled with swirling, pearly memory.
“I was very lucky to collect this,” he said, as he poured the
gleaming mass into the Pensieve. “As you will understand when we
have experienced it. Shall we?”
Harry stepped up to the stone basin and bowed obediently until
his face sank through the surface of the memory; he felt the familiar sensation of falling through nothingness and then landed upon
a dirty stone floor in almost total darkness.
It took him several seconds to recognize the place, by which time
Dumbledore had landed beside him. The Gaunts’ house was now
more indescribably filthy than anywhere Harry had ever seen. The
ceiling was thick with cobwebs, the floor coated in grime; moldy
and rotting food lay upon the table amidst a mass of crusted pots.
The only light came from a single guttering candle placed at the
feet of a man with hair and beard so overgrown Harry could see
neither eyes nor mouth. He was slumped in an armchair by the
fire, and Harry wondered for a moment whether he was dead. But



363



CHAPTER SEVENTEEN
then there came a loud knock on the door and the man jerked
awake, raising a wand in his right hand and a short knife in his
left.
The door creaked open. There on the threshold, holding an oldfashioned lamp, stood a boy Harry recognized at once: tall, pale,
dark-haired, and handsome — the teenage Voldemort.
Voldemort’s eyes moved slowly around the hovel and then found
the man in the armchair. For a few seconds they looked at each
other, then the man staggered upright, the many empty bottles at
his feet clattering and tinkling across the floor.
“YOU!” he bellowed. “YOU!”
And he hurtled drunkenly at Riddle, wand and knife held aloft.
“Stop.”
Riddle spoke in Parseltongue. The man skidded into the table,
sending moldy pots crashing to the floor. He stared at Riddle.
There was a long silence while they contemplated each other. The
man broke it.
“You speak it?”
“Yes, I speak it,” said Riddle. He moved forward into the room,
allowing the door to swing shut behind him. Harry could not help
but feel a resentful admiration for Voldemort’s complete lack of
fear. His face merely expressed disgust and, perhaps, disappointment.
“Where is Marvolo?” he asked.
“Dead,” said the other. “Died years ago, didn’t he?”
Riddle frowned.
“Who are you, then?”
“I’m Morfin, ain’t I ?”



364



A SLUGGISH MEMORY
“Marvolo’s son?”
“ ’Course I am, then . . .”
Morfin pushed the hair out of his dirty face, the better to see
Riddle, and Harry saw that he wore Marvolo’s black-stoned ring on
his right hand.
“I thought you was that Muggle,” whispered Morfin. “You look
mighty like that Muggle.”
“What Muggle?” said Riddle sharply.
“That Muggle what my sister took a fancy to, that Muggle what lives
in the big house over the way,” said Morfin, and he spat unexpectedly
upon the floor between them. “You look right like him. Riddle. But
he’s older now, in ’e? He’s older’n you, now I think on it. . . .”
Morfin looked slightly dazed and swayed a little, still clutching
the edge of the table for support. “He come back, see,” he added
stupidly.
Voldemort was gazing at Morfin as though appraising his possibilities. Now he moved a little closer and said, “Riddle came back?”
“Ar, he left her, and serve her right, marrying filth!” said Morfin,
spitting on the floor again. “Robbed us, mind, before she ran off !
Where’s the locket, eh, where’s Slytherin’s locket?”
Voldemort did not answer. Morfin was working himself into a
rage again; he brandished his knife and shouted, “Dishonored us,
she did, that little slut! And who’re you, coming here and asking questions about all that? It’s over, innit. . . . It’s over. . . .”
He looked away, staggering slightly, and Voldemort moved forward. As he did so, an unnatural darkness fell, extinguishing Voldemort’s lamp and Morfin’s candle, extinguishing everything. . . .
Dumbledore’s fingers closed tightly around Harry’s arm and



365



CHAPTER SEVENTEEN
they were soaring back into the present again. The soft golden light
in Dumbledore’s office seemed to dazzle Harry’s eyes after that impenetrable darkness.
“Is that all?” said Harry at once. “Why did it go dark, what happened?”
“Because Morfin could not remember anything from that point
onward,” said Dumbledore, gesturing Harry back into his seat.
“When he awoke next morning, he was lying on the floor, quite
alone. Marvolo’s ring had gone.
“Meanwhile, in the village of Little Hangleton, a maid was running along the High Street, screaming that there were three bodies
lying in the drawing room of the big house: Tom Riddle Senior and
his mother and father.
“The Muggle authorities were perplexed. As far as I am aware,
they do not know to this day how the Riddles died, for the Avada
Kedavra curse does not usually leave any sign of damage. . . . The
exception sits before me,” Dumbledore added, with a nod to
Harry’s scar. “The Ministry, on the other hand, knew at once that
this was a wizard’s murder. They also knew that a convicted Mugglehater lived across the valley from the Riddle house, a Muggle-hater
who had already been imprisoned once for attacking one of the
murdered people.
“So the Ministry called upon Morfin. They did not need to
question him, to use Veritaserum or Legilimency. He admitted to
the murder on the spot, giving details only the murderer could
know. He was proud, he said, to have killed the Muggles, had been
awaiting his chance all these years. He handed over his wand,
which was proved at once to have been used to kill the Riddles.
And he permitted himself to be led off to Azkaban without a fight.


366



A SLUGGISH MEMORY
All that disturbed him was the fact that his father’s ring had disappeared. ‘He’ll kill me for losing it,’ he told his captors over and over
again. ‘He’ll kill me for losing his ring.’ And that, apparently, was
all he ever said again. He lived out the remainder of his life in Azkaban, lamenting the loss of Marvolo’s last heirloom, and is buried
beside the prison, alongside the other poor souls who have expired
within its walls.”
“So Voldemort stole Morfin’s wand and used it?” said Harry, sitting up straight.
“That’s right,” said Dumbledore. “We have no memories to
show us this, but I think we can be fairly sure what happened.
Voldemort Stupefied his uncle, took his wand, and proceeded
across the valley to ‘the big house over the way’ There he murdered
the Muggle man who had abandoned his witch mother, and, for
good measure, his Muggle grandparents, thus obliterating the last
of the unworthy Riddle line and revenging himself upon the father
who never wanted him. Then he returned to the Gaunt hovel, performed the complex bit of magic that would implant a false memory in his uncle’s mind, laid Morfin’s wand beside its unconscious
owner, pocketed the ancient ring he wore, and departed.”
“And Morfin never realized he hadn’t done it?”
“Never,” said Dumbledore. “He gave, as I say, a full and boastful
confession.”
“But he had this real memory in him all the time!”
“Yes, but it took a great deal of skilled Legilimency to coax it out
of him,” said Dumbledore, “and why should anybody delve further
into Morfin’s mind when he had already confessed to the crime?
However, I was able to secure a visit to Morfin in the last weeks of
his life, by which time I was attempting to discover as much as I


367



CHAPTER SEVENTEEN
could about Voldemort’s past. I extracted this memory with difficulty. When I saw what it contained, I attempted to use it to secure
Morfin’s release from Azkaban. Before the Ministry reached their
decision, however, Morfin had died.”
“But how come the Ministry didn’t realize that Voldemort had
done all that to Morfin?” Harry asked angrily. “He was underage at
the time, wasn’t he? I thought they could detect underage magic!”
“You are quite right — they can detect magic, but not the perpetrator: You will remember that you were blamed by the Ministry
for the Hover Charm that was, in fact, cast by —”
“Dobby,” growled Harry; this injustice still rankled. “So if you’re
underage and you do magic inside an adult witch or wizard’s house,
the Ministry won’t know?”
“They will certainly be unable to tell who performed the magic,”
said Dumbledore, smiling slightly at the look of great indignation
on Harry’s face. “They rely on witch and wizard parents to enforce
their offspring’s obedience while within their walls.”
“Well, that’s rubbish,” snapped Harry. “Look what happened
here, look what happened to Morfin!”
“I agree,” said Dumbledore. “Whatever Morfin was, he did not
deserve to die as he did, blamed for murders he had not committed. But it is getting late, and I want you to see this other memory
before we part. . . .”
Dumbledore took from an inside pocket another crystal phial
and Harry fell silent at once, remembering that Dumbledore had
said it was the most important one he had collected. Harry noticed
that the contents proved difficult to empty into the Pensieve, as
though they had congealed slightly; did memories go bad?
“This will not take long,” said Dumbledore, when he had finally


368



A SLUGGISH MEMORY
emptied the phial. “We shall be back before you know it. Once
more into the Pensieve, then . . .”
And Harry fell again through the silver surface, landing this time
right in front of a man he recognized at once.
It was a much younger Horace Slughorn. Harry was so used to
him bald that he found the sight of Slughorn with thick, shiny,
straw-colored hair quite disconcerting; it looked as though he had
had his head thatched, though there was already a shiny Galleonsized bald patch on his crown. His mustache, less massive than it
was these days, was gingery-blond. He was not quite as rotund as
the Slughorn Harry knew, though the golden buttons on his richly
embroidered waistcoat were taking a fair amount of strain. His little feet resting upon a velvet pouffe, he was sitting well back in a
comfortable winged armchair, one hand grasping a small glass of
wine, the other searching through a box of crystalized pineapple.
Harry looked around as Dumbledore appeared beside him and
saw that they were standing in Slughorn’s office. Half a dozen boys
were sitting around Slughorn, all on harder or lower seats than his,
and all in their mid-teens. Harry recognized Voldemort at once.
His was the most handsome face and he looked the most relaxed of
all the boys. His right hand lay negligently upon the arm of his
chair; with a jolt, Harry saw that he was wearing Marvolo’s goldand-black ring; he had already killed his father.
“Sir, is it true that Professor Merrythought is retiring?” he asked.
“Tom, Tom, if I knew I couldn’t tell you,” said Slughorn, wagging a reproving, sugar-covered finger at Riddle, though ruining
the effect slightly by winking. “I must say, I’d like to know where
you get your information, boy, more knowledgeable than half the
staff, you are.”


369



CHAPTER SEVENTEEN
Riddle smiled; the other boys laughed and cast him admiring
looks.
“What with your uncanny ability to know things you shouldn’t,
and your careful flattery of the people who matter — thank you for
the pineapple, by the way, you’re quite right, it is my favorite —”
As several of the boys tittered, something very odd happened.
The whole room was suddenly filled with a thick white fog, so that
Harry could see nothing but the face of Dumbledore, who was
standing beside him. Then Slughorn’s voice rang out through the
mist, unnaturally loudly, “You’ll go wrong, boy, mark my words.”
The fog cleared as suddenly as it had appeared and yet nobody
made any allusion to it, nor did anybody look as though anything
unusual had just happened. Bewildered, Harry looked around as a
small golden clock standing upon Slughorn’s desk chimed eleven
o’clock.
“Good gracious, is it that time already?” said Slughorn. “You’d
better get going, boys, or we’ll all be in trouble. Lestrange, I want
your essay by tomorrow or it’s detention. Same goes for you, Avery.”
Slughorn pulled himself out of his armchair and carried his
empty glass over to his desk as the boys filed out. Voldemort, however, stayed behind. Harry could tell he had dawdled deliberately,
wanting to be last in the room with Slughorn.
“Look sharp, Tom,” said Slughorn, turning around and finding
him still present. “You don’t want to be caught out of bed out of
hours, and you a prefect . . .”
“Sir, I wanted to ask you something.”
“Ask away, then, m’boy, ask away. . . .”
“Sir, I wondered what you know about . . . about Horcruxes?”
And it happened all over again: The dense fog filled the room


370



A SLUGGISH MEMORY
so that Harry could not see Slughorn or Voldemort at all; only
Dumbledore, smiling serenely beside him. Then Slughorn’s voice
boomed out again, just as it had done before.
“I don’t know anything about Horcruxes and I wouldn’t tell you if I
did! Now get out of here at once and don’t let me catch you mentioning
them again!”
“Well, that’s that,” said Dumbledore placidly beside Harry.
“Time to go.”
And Harry’s feet left the floor to fall, seconds later, back onto the
rug in front of Dumbledore’s desk.
“That’s all there is?” said Harry blankly.
Dumbledore had said that this was the most important memory
of all, but he could not see what was so significant about it. Admittedly the fog, and the fact that nobody seemed to have noticed
it, was odd, but other than that nothing seemed to have happened
except that Voldemort had asked a question and failed to get an
answer.
“As you might have noticed,” said Dumbledore, reseating himself behind his desk, “that memory has been tampered with.”
“Tampered with?” repeated Harry, sitting back down too.
“Certainly,” said Dumbledore. “Professor Slughorn has meddled
with his own recollections.”
“But why would he do that?”
“Because, I think, he is ashamed of what he remembers,” said
Dumbledore. “He has tried to rework the memory to show himself
in a better light, obliterating those parts which he does not wish me
to see. It is, as you will have noticed, very crudely done, and that is
all to the good, for it shows that the true memory is still there beneath the alterations.


371



CHAPTER SEVENTEEN
“And so, for the first time, I am giving you homework, Harry. It
will be your job to persuade Professor Slughorn to divulge the real
memory, which will undoubtedly be our most crucial piece of information of all.”
Harry stared at him.
“But surely, sir,” he said, keeping his voice as respectful as possible, “you don’t need me — you could use Legilimency . . . or
Veritaserum. . . .”
“Professor Slughorn is an extremely able wizard who will be expecting both,” said Dumbledore. “He is much more accomplished
at Occlumency than poor Morfin Gaunt, and I would be astonished if he has not carried an antidote to Veritaserum with him ever
since I coerced him into giving me this travesty of a recollection.
“No, I think it would be foolish to attempt to wrest the truth
from Professor Slughorn by force, and might do much more harm
than good; I do not wish him to leave Hogwarts. However, he has
his weaknesses like the rest of us, and I believe that you are the one
person who might be able to penetrate his defenses. It is most important that we secure the true memory, Harry. . . . How important, we will only know when we have seen the real thing. So, good
luck . . . and good night.”
A little taken aback by the abrupt dismissal, Harry got to his feet
quickly. “Good night, sir.”
As he closed the study door behind him, he distinctly heard
Phineas Nigellus say, “I can’t see why the boy should be able to do
it better than you, Dumbledore.”
“I wouldn’t expect you to, Phineas,” replied Dumbledore, and
Fawkes gave another low, musical cry.

BIRTHDAY SURPRISES

T

he next day Harry confided in both Ron and Hermione
the task that Dumbledore had set him, though separately,
for Hermione still refused to remain in Ron’s presence longer than
it took to give him a contemptuous look.
Ron thought that Harry was unlikely to have any trouble with
Slughorn at all.
“He loves you,” he said over breakfast, waving an airy forkful of
fried egg. “Won’t refuse you anything, will he? Not his little Potions
Prince. Just hang back after class this afternoon and ask him.”
Hermione, however, took a gloomier view. “He must be determined to hide what really happened if Dumbledore couldn’t get it
out of him,” she said in a low voice, as they stood in the deserted,
snowy courtyard at break. “Horcruxes . . . Horcruxes . . . I’ve never
even heard of them. . . .”
“You haven’t?” Harry was disappointed; he had hoped that



373



CHAPTER EIGHTEEN
Hermione might have been able to give him a clue as to what Horcruxes were.
“They must be really advanced Dark Magic, or why would
Voldemort have wanted to know about them? I think it’s going
to be difficult to get the information, Harry, you’ll have to be very
careful about how you approach Slughorn, think out a strategy. . . .”
“Ron reckons I should just hang back after Potions this afternoon. . . .”
“Oh, well, if Won-Won thinks that, you’d better do it,” she said,
flaring up at once. “After all, when has Won-Won’s judgment ever
been faulty?”
“Hermione, can’t you — ?”
“No!” she said angrily, and stormed away, leaving Harry alone
and ankle-deep in snow.
Potions lessons were uncomfortable enough these days, seeing as
Harry, Ron, and Hermione had to share a desk. Today, Hermione
moved her cauldron around the table so that she was close to Ernie,
and ignored both Harry and Ron.
“What’ve you done?” Ron muttered to Harry, looking at Hermione’s haughty profile.
But before Harry could answer, Slughorn was calling for silence
from the front of the room.
“Settle down, settle down, please! Quickly, now, lots of work to
get through this afternoon! Golpalott’s Third Law . . . who can tell
me — ? But Miss Granger can, of course!”
Hermione recited at top speed: “Golpalott’s-Third-Law-statesthat-the-antidote-for-a-blended-poison-will-be-equal-to-more-thanthe-sum-of-the-antidotes-for-each-of-the-separate-components.”


374



BIRTHDAY SURPRISES
“Precisely!” beamed Slughorn. “Ten points for Gryffindor! Now,
if we accept Golpalott’s Third Law as true . . .”
Harry was going to have to take Slughorn’s word for it that Golpalott’s Third Law was true, because he had not understood any of
it. Nobody apart from Hermione seemed to be following what
Slughorn said next either.
“. . . which means, of course, that assuming we have achieved
correct identification of the potion’s ingredients by Scarpin’s Revelaspell, our primary aim is not the relatively simple one of selecting
antidotes to those ingredients in and of themselves, but to find that
added component that will, by an almost alchemical process, transform these disparate elements —”
Ron was sitting beside Harry with his mouth half open, doodling absently on his new copy of Advanced Potion-Making. Ron
kept forgetting that he could no longer rely on Hermione to help
him out of trouble when he failed to grasp what was going on.
“. . . and so,” finished Slughorn, “I want each of you to come
and take one of these phials from my desk. You are to create an antidote for the poison within it before the end of the lesson. Good
luck, and don’t forget your protective gloves!”
Hermione had left her stool and was halfway toward Slughorn’s
desk before the rest of the class had realized it was time to move,
and by the time Harry, Ron, and Ernie returned to the table, she
had already tipped the contents of her phial into her cauldron and
was kindling a fire underneath it.
“It’s a shame that the Prince won’t be able to help you much
with this, Harry,” she said brightly as she straightened up. “You
have to understand the principles involved this time. No shortcuts
or cheats!”


375

CHAPTER EIGHTEEN
Annoyed, Harry uncorked the poison he had taken from Slughorn’s desk, which was a garish shade of pink, tipped it into his
cauldron, and lit a fire underneath it. He did not have the faintest
idea what he was supposed to do next. He glanced around at Ron,
who was now standing there looking rather gormless, having
copied everything Harry had done.
“You sure the Prince hasn’t got any tips?” Ron muttered to
Harry.
Harry pulled out his trusty copy of Advanced Potion-Making and
turned to the chapter on antidotes. There was Golpalott’s Third
Law, stated word for word as Hermione had recited it, but not a
single illuminating note in the Prince’s hand to explain what it
meant. Apparently the Prince, like Hermione, had had no difficulty understanding it.
“Nothing,” said Harry gloomily.
Hermione was now waving her wand enthusiastically over her
cauldron. Unfortunately, they could not copy the spell she was doing because she was now so good at nonverbal incantations that she
did not need to say the words aloud. Ernie Macmillan, however,
was muttering, “Specialis Revelio!” over his cauldron, which sounded
impressive, so Harry and Ron hastened to imitate him.
It took Harry only five minutes to realize that his reputation as
the best potion-maker in the class was crashing around his ears.
Slughorn had peered hopefully into his cauldron on his first circuit
of the dungeon, preparing to exclaim in delight as he usually did,
and instead had withdrawn his head hastily, coughing, as the smell
of bad eggs overwhelmed him. Hermione’s expression could not
have been any smugger; she had loathed being outperformed in
every Potions class. She was now decanting the mysteriously sepa

376



BIRTHDAY SURPRISES
rated ingredients of her poison into ten different crystal phials.
More to avoid watching this irritating sight than anything else,
Harry bent over the Half-Blood Prince’s book and turned a few
pages with unnecessary force.
And there it was, scrawled right across a long list of antidotes:
Just shove a bezoar down their throats.
Harry stared at these words for a moment. Hadn’t he once, long
ago, heard of bezoars? Hadn’t Snape mentioned them in their firstever Potions lesson? “A stone taken from the stomach of a goat, which
will protect from most poisons.”
It was not an answer to the Golpalott problem, and had Snape
still been their teacher, Harry would not have dared do it, but this
was a moment for desperate measures. He hastened toward the
store cupboard and rummaged within it, pushing aside unicorn
horns and tangles of dried herbs until he found, at the very back, a
small cardboard box on which had been scribbled the word
bezoars.
He opened the box just as Slughorn called, “Two minutes left,
everyone!” Inside were half a dozen shriveled brown objects, looking more like dried-up kidneys than real stones. Harry seized one,
put the box back in the cupboard, and hurried back to his
cauldron.
“Time’s . . . UP!” called Slughorn genially. “Well, let’s see how
you’ve done! Blaise . . . what have you got for me?”
Slowly, Slughorn moved around the room, examining the various antidotes. Nobody had finished the task, although Hermione
was trying to cram a few more ingredients into her bottle before


377



CHAPTER EIGHTEEN
Slughorn reached her. Ron had given up completely, and was
merely trying to avoid breathing in the putrid fumes issuing from
his cauldron. Harry stood there waiting, the bezoar clutched in a
slightly sweaty hand.
Slughorn reached their table last. He sniffed Ernie’s potion and
passed on to Ron’s with a grimace. He did not linger over Ron’s
cauldron, but backed away swiftly, retching slightly.
“And you, Harry,” he said. “What have you got to show me?”
Harry held out his hand, the bezoar sitting on his palm.
Slughorn looked down at it for a full ten seconds. Harry wondered, for a moment, whether he was going to shout at him. Then
he threw back his head and roared with laughter.
“You’ve got nerve, boy!” he boomed, taking the bezoar and holding it up so that the class could see it. “Oh, you’re like your mother.
. . . Well, I can’t fault you. . . . A bezoar would certainly act as an
antidote to all these potions!”
Hermione, who was sweaty-faced and had soot on her nose,
looked livid. Her half-finished antidote, comprising fifty-two ingredients, including a chunk of her own hair, bubbled sluggishly
behind Slughorn, who had eyes for nobody but Harry.
“And you thought of a bezoar all by yourself, did you, Harry?”
she asked through gritted teeth.
“That’s the individual spirit a real potion-maker needs!” said
Slughorn happily, before Harry could reply. “Just like his mother,
she had the same intuitive grasp of potion-making, it’s undoubtedly from Lily he gets it. . . . Yes, Harry, yes, if you’ve got a bezoar
to hand, of course that would do the trick . . . although as they
don’t work on everything, and are pretty rare, it’s still worth knowing how to mix antidotes. . . .”


378

BIRTHDAY SURPRISES
The only person in the room looking angrier than Hermione
was Malfoy, who, Harry was pleased to see, had spilled something
that looked like cat-sick over himself. Before either of them could
express their fury that Harry had come top of the class by not doing any work, however, the bell rang.
“Time to pack up!” said Slughorn. “And an extra ten points to
Gryffindor for sheer cheek!”
Still chuckling, he waddled back to his desk at the front of the
dungeon.
Harry dawdled behind, taking an inordinate amount of time to
do up his bag. Neither Ron nor Hermione wished him luck as they
left; both looked rather annoyed. At last Harry and Slughorn were
the only two left in the room.
“Come on, now, Harry, you’ll be late for your next lesson,” said
Slughorn affably, snapping the gold clasps shut on his dragon-skin
briefcase.
“Sir,” said Harry, reminding himself irresistibly of Voldemort, “I
wanted to ask you something.”
“Ask away, then, my dear boy, ask away. . . .”
“Sir, I wondered what you know about . . . about Horcruxes?”
Slughorn froze. His round face seemed to sink in upon itself. He
licked his lips and said hoarsely, “What did you say?”
“I asked whether you know anything about Horcruxes, sir. You
see —”
“Dumbledore put you up to this,” whispered Slughorn. His
voice had changed completely. It was not genial anymore, but
shocked, terrified. He fumbled in his breast pocket and pulled out
a handkerchief, mopping his sweating brow. “Dumbledore’s shown
you that — that memory. Well? Hasn’t he?”


379



CHAPTER EIGHTEEN
“Yes,” said Harry, deciding on the spot that it was best not to lie.
“Yes, of course,” said Slughorn quietly, still dabbing at his white
face. “Of course . . . well, if you’ve seen that memory, Harry, you’ll
know that I don’t know anything — anything” — he repeated the
word forcefully — “about Horcruxes.”
He seized his dragon-skin briefcase, stuffed his handkerchief
back into his pocket, and marched to the dungeon door.
“Sir,” said Harry desperately, “I just thought there might be a bit
more to the memory —”
“Did you?” said Slughorn. “Then you were wrong, weren’t you?
WRONG!”
He bellowed the last word and, before Harry could say another
word, slammed the dungeon door behind him.
Neither Ron nor Hermione was at all sympathetic when Harry
told them of this disastrous interview. Hermione was still seething
at the way Harry had triumphed without doing the work properly.
Ron was resentful that Harry hadn’t slipped him a bezoar too.
“It would’ve just looked stupid if we’d both done it!” said Harry
irritably. “Look, I had to try and soften him up so I could ask him
about Voldemort, didn’t I? Oh, will you get a grip!” he added in exasperation, as Ron winced at the sound of the name.
Infuriated by his failure and by Ron’s and Hermione’s attitudes,
Harry brooded for the next few days over what to do next about
Slughorn. He decided that, for the time being, he would let Slughorn think that he had forgotten all about Horcruxes; it was surely
best to lull him into a false sense of security before returning to the
attack.
When Harry did not question Slughorn again, the Potions
master reverted to his usual affectionate treatment of him, and


380



BIRTHDAY SURPRISES
appeared to have put the matter from his mind. Harry awaited an
invitation to one of his little evening parties, determined to accept
this time, even if he had to reschedule Quidditch practice. Unfortunately, however, no such invitation arrived. Harry checked with
Hermione and Ginny: Neither of them had received an invitation
and nor, as far as they knew, had anybody else. Harry could not
help wondering whether this meant that Slughorn was not quite as
forgetful as he appeared, simply determined to give Harry no additional opportunities to question him.
Meanwhile, the Hogwarts library had failed Hermione for the
first time in living memory. She was so shocked, she even forgot
that she was annoyed at Harry for his trick with the bezoar.
“I haven’t found one single explanation of what Horcruxes do!”
she told him. “Not a single one! I’ve been right through the restricted section and even in the most horrible books, where they tell
you how to brew the most gruesome potions — nothing! All I could
find was this, in the introduction to Magick Moste Evile — listen —
‘Of the Horcrux, wickedest of magical inventions, we shall not
speak nor give direction. . . .’ I mean, why mention it then?” she
said impatiently, slamming the old book shut; it let out a ghostly
wail. “Oh, shut up,” she snapped, stuffing it back into her bag.
The snow melted around the school as February arrived, to be
replaced by cold, dreary wetness. Purplish-gray clouds hung low
over the castle and a constant fall of chilly rain made the lawns slippery and muddy. The upshot of this was that the sixth years’ first
Apparition lesson, which was scheduled for a Saturday morning so
that no normal lessons would be missed, took place in the Great
Hall instead of in the grounds.
When Harry and Hermione arrived in the Hall (Ron had come


381



CHAPTER EIGHTEEN
down with Lavender), they found that the tables had disappeared.
Rain lashed against the high windows and the enchanted ceiling
swirled darkly above them as they assembled in front of Professors
McGonagall, Snape, Flitwick, and Sprout — the Heads of Houses
— and a small wizard whom Harry took to be the Apparition instructor from the Ministry. He was oddly colorless, with transparent eyelashes, wispy hair, and an insubstantial air, as though a single
gust of wind might blow him away. Harry wondered whether constant disappearances and reappearances had somehow diminished
his substance, or whether this frail build was ideal for anyone wishing to vanish.
“Good morning,” said the Ministry wizard, when all the students had arrived and the Heads of Houses had called for quiet.
“My name is Wilkie Twycross and I shall be your Ministry Apparition instructor for the next twelve weeks. I hope to be able to
prepare you for your Apparition Tests in this time —”
“Malfoy, be quiet and pay attention!” barked Professor McGonagall.
Everybody looked around. Malfoy had flushed a dull pink; he
looked furious as he stepped away from Crabbe, with whom he appeared to have been having a whispered argument. Harry glanced
quickly at Snape, who also looked annoyed, though Harry strongly
suspected that this was less because of Malfoy’s rudeness than the
fact that McGonagall had reprimanded one of his House.
“— by which time, many of you may be ready to take your
tests,” Twycross continued, as though there had been no interruption.
“As you may know, it is usually impossible to Apparate or
Disapparate within Hogwarts. The headmaster has lifted this en

BIRTHDAY SURPRISES
chantment, purely within the Great Hall, for one hour, so as to enable you to practice. May I emphasize that you will not be able to
Apparate outside the walls of this Hall, and that you would be unwise to try.
“I would like each of you to place yourselves now so that you
have a clear five feet of space in front of you.”
There was a great scrambling and jostling as people separated,
banged into each other, and ordered others out of their space. The
Heads of Houses moved among the students, marshaling them
into position and breaking up arguments.
“Harry, where are you going?” demanded Hermione.
But Harry did not answer; he was moving quickly through the
crowd, past the place where Professor Flitwick was making squeaky
attempts to position a few Ravenclaws, all of whom wanted to be
near the front, past Professor Sprout, who was chivying the Hufflepuffs into line, until, by dodging around Ernie Macmillan, he
managed to position himself right at the back of the crowd, directly
behind Malfoy, who was taking advantage of the general upheaval
to continue his argument with Crabbe, standing five feet away and
looking mutinous.
“I don’t know how much longer, all right?” Malfoy shot at him,
oblivious to Harry standing right behind him. “It’s taking longer
than I thought it would.”
Crabbe opened his mouth, but Malfoy appeared to second-guess
what he was going to say. “Look, it’s none of your business what
I’m doing, Crabbe, you and Goyle just do as you’re told and keep a
lookout!”
“I tell my friends what I’m up to, if I want them to keep a lookout for me,” Harry said, just loud enough for Malfoy to hear him.


383

CHAPTER EIGHTEEN
Malfoy spun around on the spot, his hand flying to his wand,
but at that precise moment the four Heads of House shouted,
“Quiet!” and silence fell again. Malfoy turned slowly to face the
front again.
“Thank you,” said Twycross. “Now then . . .”
He waved his wand. Old-fashioned wooden hoops instantly appeared on the floor in front of every student.
“The important things to remember when Apparating are the
three D’s!” said Twycross. “Destination, Determination, Deliberation!
“Step one: Fix your mind firmly upon the desired destination,”
said Twycross. “In this case, the interior of your hoop. Kindly concentrate upon that destination now.”
Everybody looked around furtively to check that everyone else
was staring into their hoop, then hastily did as they were told.
Harry gazed at the circular patch of dusty floor enclosed by his
hoop and tried hard to think of nothing else. This proved impossible, as he couldn’t stop puzzling over what Malfoy was doing that
needed lookouts.
“Step two,” said Twycross, “focus your determination to occupy
the visualized space! Let your yearning to enter it flood from your
mind to every particle of your body!”
Harry glanced around surreptitiously. A little way to his left,
Ernie Macmillan was contemplating his hoop so hard that his face
had turned pink; it looked as though he was straining to lay a
Quaffle-sized egg. Harry bit back a laugh and hastily returned his
gaze to his own hoop.
“Step three,” called Twycross, “and only when I give the com-



384



BIRTHDAY SURPRISES
mand . . . Turn on the spot, feeling your way into nothingness,
moving with deliberation! On my command, now . . . one —”
Harry glanced around again; lots of people were looking positively alarmed at being asked to Apparate so quickly.
“— two —”
Harry tried to fix his thoughts on his hoop again; he had already
forgotten what the three D’s stood for.
“— THREE!”
Harry spun on the spot, lost balance, and nearly fell over. He
was not the only one. The whole Hall was suddenly full of staggering people; Neville was flat on his back; Ernie Macmillan, on the
other hand, had done a kind of pirouetting leap into his hoop and
looked momentarily thrilled, until he caught sight of Dean
Thomas roaring with laughter at him.
“Never mind, never mind,” said Twycross dryly, who did not
seem to have expected anything better. “Adjust your hoops, please,
and back to your original positions. . . .”
The second attempt was no better than the first. The third was
just as bad. Not until the fourth did anything exciting happen.
There was a horrible screech of pain and everybody looked around,
terrified, to see Susan Bones of Hufflepuff wobbling in her hoop
with her left leg still standing five feet away where she had started.
The Heads of House converged on her; there was a great bang
and a puff of purple smoke, which cleared to reveal Susan sobbing,
reunited with her leg but looking horrified.
“Splinching, or the separation of random body parts,” said
Wilkie Twycross dispassionately, “occurs when the mind is insufficiently determined. You must concentrate continuously upon your



385



CHAPTER EIGHTEEN
destination, and move, without haste, but with deliberation . . .
thus.”
Twycross stepped forward, turned gracefully on the spot with his
arms outstretched, and vanished in a swirl of robes, reappearing at
the back of the Hall.
“Remember the three D’s,” he said, “and try again . . . one —
two — three —”
But an hour later, Susan’s Splinching was still the most interesting thing that had happened. Twycross did not seem discouraged.
Fastening his cloak at his neck, he merely said, “Until next Saturday, everybody, and do not forget: Destination. Determination.
Deliberation.”
With that, he waved his wand, Vanishing the hoops, and walked
out of the Hall accompanied by Professor McGonagall. Talk broke
out at once as people began moving toward the entrance hall.
“How did you do?” asked Ron, hurrying toward Harry. “I think
I felt something the last time I tried — a kind of tingling in my
feet.”
“I expect your trainers are too small, Won-Won,” said a voice behind them, and Hermione stalked past, smirking.
“I didn’t feel anything,” said Harry, ignoring this interruption.
“But I don’t care about that now —”
“What d’you mean, you don’t care? Don’t you want to learn to
Apparate?” said Ron incredulously.
“I’m not fussed, really, I prefer flying,” said Harry, glancing over
his shoulder to see where Malfoy was, and speeding up as they
came into the entrance hall. “Look, hurry up, will you, there’s
something I want to do. . . .”
Perplexed, Ron followed Harry back to the Gryffindor Tower at

a run. They were temporarily detained by Peeves, who had jammed
a door on the fourth floor shut and was refusing to let anyone pass
until they set fire to their own pants, but Harry and Ron simply
turned back and took one of their trusted shortcuts. Within five
minutes, they were climbing through the portrait hole.
“Are you going to tell me what we’re doing, then?” asked Ron,
panting slightly.
“Up here,” said Harry, and he crossed the common room and led
the way through the door to the boys’ staircase.
Their dormitory was, as Harry had hoped, empty. He flung open
his trunk and began to rummage in it, while Ron watched
impatiently.
“Harry . . .”
“Malfoy’s using Crabbe and Goyle as lookouts. He was arguing
with Crabbe just now. I want to know — aha.”
He had found it, a folded square of apparently blank parchment,
which he now smoothed out and tapped with the tip of his wand.
“I solemnly swear that I am up to no good . . . or Malfoy is anyway.”
At once, the Marauder’s Map appeared on the parchment’s surface. Here was a detailed plan of every one of the castle’s floors and,
moving around it, the tiny, labeled black dots that signified each of
the castle’s occupants.
“Help me find Malfoy,” said Harry urgently.
He laid the map upon his bed, and he and Ron leaned over it,
searching.
“There!” said Ron, after a minute or so. “He’s in the Slytherin
common room, look . . . with Parkinson and Zabini and Crabbe
and Goyle . . .”


387



CHAPTER EIGHTEEN
Harry looked down at the map, disappointed, but rallied almost
at once.
“Well, I’m keeping an eye on him from now on,” he said firmly.
“And the moment I see him lurking somewhere with Crabbe and
Goyle keeping watch outside, it’ll be on with the old Invisibility
Cloak and off to find out what he’s —”
He broke off as Neville entered the dormitory, bringing with
him a strong smell of singed material, and began rummaging in his
trunk for a fresh pair of pants.
Despite his determination to catch Malfoy out, Harry had no
luck at all over the next couple of weeks. Although he consulted the
map as often as he could, sometimes making unnecessary visits to
the bathroom between lessons to search it, he did not once see Malfoy anywhere suspicious. Admittedly, he spotted Crabbe and Goyle
moving around the castle on their own more often than usual,
sometimes remaining stationary in deserted corridors, but at these
times Malfoy was not only nowhere near them, but impossible to
locate on the map at all. This was most mysterious. Harry toyed
with the possibility that Malfoy was actually leaving the school
grounds, but could not see how he could be doing it, given the very
high level of security now operating within the castle. He could
only suppose that he was missing Malfoy amongst the hundreds of
tiny black dots upon the map. As for the fact that Malfoy, Crabbe,
and Goyle appeared to be going their different ways when they
were usually inseparable, these things happened as people got
older — Ron and Hermione, Harry reflected sadly, were living
proof.
February moved toward March with no change in the weather
except that it became windy as well as wet. To general indignation,


388



BIRTHDAY SURPRISES
a sign went up on all common room notice boards that the next
trip into Hogsmeade had been canceled. Ron was furious.
“It was on my birthday!” he said. “I was looking forward to
that!”
“Not a big surprise, though, is it?” said Harry. “Not after what
happened to Katie.”
She had still not returned from St. Mungo’s. What was more,
further disappearances had been reported in the Daily Prophet, including several relatives of students at Hogwarts.
“But now all I’ve got to look forward to is stupid Apparition!”
said Ron grumpily. “Big birthday treat . . .”
Three lessons on, Apparition was proving as difficult as ever,
though a few more people had managed to Splinch themselves.
Frustration was running high and there was a certain amount of illfeeling toward Wilkie Twycross and his three D’s, which had inspired a number of nicknames for him, the politest of which were
Dogbreath and Dunghead.
“Happy birthday, Ron,” said Harry, when they were woken on
the first of March by Seamus and Dean leaving noisily for breakfast. “Have a present.”
He threw the package across onto Ron’s bed, where it joined a
small pile of them that must, Harry assumed, have been delivered
by house-elves in the night.
“Cheers,” said Ron drowsily and, as he ripped off the paper,
Harry got out of bed, opened his own trunk, and began rummaging in it for the Marauder’s Map, which he hid after every use. He
turfed out half the contents of his trunk before he found it hiding
beneath the rolled-up socks in which he was still keeping his bottle
of lucky potion, Felix Felicis.


CHAPTER EIGHTEEN
“Right,” he murmured, taking it back to bed with him, tapping
it quietly and murmuring, “I solemnly swear that I am up to no
good,” so that Neville, who was passing the foot of his bed at the
time, would not hear.
“Nice one, Harry!” said Ron enthusiastically, waving the new
pair of Quidditch Keeper’s gloves Harry had given him.
“No problem,” said Harry absentmindedly, as he searched the
Slytherin dormitory closely for Malfoy. “Hey . . . I don’t think he’s
in his bed. . . .”
Ron did not answer; he was too busy unwrapping presents, every
now and then letting out an exclamation of pleasure.
“Seriously good haul this year!” he announced, holding up a
heavy gold watch with odd symbols around the edge and tiny moving stars instead of hands. “See what Mum and Dad got me?
Blimey, I think I’ll come of age next year too. . . .”
“Cool,” muttered Harry, sparing the watch a glance before peering more closely at the map. Where was Malfoy? He did not seem
to be at the Slytherin table in the Great Hall, eating breakfast. . . .
He was nowhere near Snape, who was sitting in his study. . . . He
wasn’t in any of the bathrooms or in the hospital wing. . . .
“Want one?” said Ron thickly, holding out a box of Chocolate
Cauldrons.
“No thanks,” said Harry, looking up. “Malfoy’s gone again!”
“Can’t have done,” said Ron, stuffing a second Cauldron into his
mouth as he slid out of bed to get dressed. “Come on, if you don’t
hurry up, you’ll have to Apparate on an empty stomach. . . . Might
make it easier, I suppose . . .” Ron looked thoughtfully at the box
of Chocolate Cauldrons, then shrugged and helped himself to a
third.


390



BIRTHDAY SURPRISES
Harry tapped the map with his wand, muttered, “Mischief managed,” though it hadn’t been, and got dressed, thinking hard. There
had to be an explanation for Malfoy’s periodic disappearances, but
he simply could not think what it could be. The best way of finding out would be to tail him, but even with the Invisibility Cloak
this was an impractical idea: Harry had lessons, Quidditch practice, homework, and Apparition; he could not follow Malfoy
around school all day without his absence being remarked upon.
“Ready?” he said to Ron.
He was halfway to the dormitory door when he realized that
Ron had not moved, but was leaning on his bedpost, staring out of
the rain-washed window with a strangely unfocused look on his
face.
“Ron? Breakfast.”
“I’m not hungry.”
Harry stared at him.
“I thought you just said — ?”
“Well, all right, I’ll come down with you,” sighed Ron, “but I
don’t want to eat.”
Harry scrutinized him suspiciously.
“You’ve just eaten half a box of Chocolate Cauldrons, haven’t
you?”
“It’s not that,” Ron sighed again. “You . . . you wouldn’t understand.”
“Fair enough,” said Harry, albeit puzzled, as he turned to open
the door.
“Harry!” said Ron suddenly.
“What?”
“Harry, I can’t stand it!”




CHAPTER EIGHTEEN
“You can’t stand what?” asked Harry, now starting to feel definitely alarmed. Ron was rather pale and looked as though he was
about to be sick.
“I can’t stop thinking about her!” said Ron hoarsely.
Harry gaped at him. He had not expected this and was not sure
he wanted to hear it. Friends they might be, but if Ron started calling Lavender “Lav-Lav,” he would have to put his foot down.
“Why does that stop you having breakfast?” Harry asked, trying
to inject a note of common sense into the proceedings.
“I don’t think she knows I exist,” said Ron with a desperate
gesture.
“She definitely knows you exist,” said Harry, bewildered. “She
keeps snogging you, doesn’t she?”
Ron blinked. “Who are you talking about?”
“Who are you talking about?” said Harry, with an increasing
sense that all reason had dropped out of the conversation.
“Romilda Vane,” said Ron softly, and his whole face seemed to
illuminate as he said it, as though hit by a ray of purest sunlight.
They stared at each other for almost a whole minute, before
Harry said, “This is a joke, right? You’re joking.”
“I think . . . Harry, I think I love her,” said Ron in a strangled
voice.
“Okay,” said Harry, walking up to Ron to get a better look at the
glazed eyes and the pallid complexion, “okay. . . Say that again
with a straight face.”
“I love her,” repeated Ron breathlessly. “Have you seen her hair,
it’s all black and shiny and silky . . . and her eyes? Her big dark
eyes? And her —”

“This is really funny and everything,” said Harry impatiently,
“but joke’s over, all right? Drop it.”
He turned to leave; he had got two steps toward the door when
a crashing blow hit him on the right ear. Staggering, he looked
around. Ron’s fist was drawn right back; his face was contorted
with rage; he was about to strike again.
Harry reacted instinctively; his wand was out of his pocket and
the incantation sprang to mind without conscious thought: Levicorpus!
Ron yelled as his heel was wrenched upward once more; he dangled helplessly, upside down, his robes hanging off him.
“What was that for?” Harry bellowed.
“You insulted her, Harry! You said it was a joke!” shouted Ron,
who was slowly turning purple in the face as all the blood rushed to
his head.
“This is insane!” said Harry. “What’s got into — ?”
And then he saw the box lying open on Ron’s bed, and the truth
hit him with the force of a stampeding troll.
“Where did you get those Chocolate Cauldrons?”
“They were a birthday present!” shouted Ron, revolving slowly in
midair as he struggled to get free. “I offered you one, didn’t I?”
“You just picked them up off the floor, didn’t you?”
“They’d fallen off my bed, all right? Let me go!”
“They didn’t fall off your bed, you prat, don’t you understand?
They were mine, I chucked them out of my trunk when I was looking for the map, they’re the Chocolate Cauldrons Romilda gave me
before Christmas, and they’re all spiked with love potion!”
But only one word of this seemed to have registered with Ron.

“Romilda?” he repeated. “Did you say Romilda? Harry — do
you know her? Can you introduce me?”
Harry stared at the dangling Ron, whose face now looked
tremendously hopeful, and fought a strong desire to laugh. A part
of him — the part closest to his throbbing right ear — was quite
keen on the idea of letting Ron down and watching him run amok
until the effects of the potion wore off. . . . But on the other hand,
they were supposed to be friends, Ron had not been himself when
he had attacked, and Harry thought that he would deserve another
punching if he permitted Ron to declare undying love for Romilda
Vane.
“Yeah, I’ll introduce you,” said Harry, thinking fast. “I’m going
to let you down now, okay?”
He sent Ron crashing back to the floor (his ear did hurt quite a
lot), but Ron simply bounded to his feet again, grinning.
“She’ll be in Slughorn’s office,” said Harry confidently, leading
the way to the door.
“Why will she be in there?” asked Ron anxiously, hurrying to
keep up.
“Oh, she has extra Potions lessons with him,” said Harry, inventing wildly.
“Maybe I could ask if I can have them with her?” said Ron
eagerly.
“Great idea,” said Harry.
Lavender was waiting beside the portrait hole, a complication
Harry had not foreseen.
“You’re late, Won-Won!” she pouted. “I’ve got you a birthday —”
“Leave me alone,” said Ron impatiently. “Harry’s going to introduce me to Romilda Vane.”

And without another word to her, he pushed his way out of the
portrait hole. Harry tried to make an apologetic face to Lavender,
but it might have turned out simply amused, because she looked
more offended than ever as the Fat Lady swung shut behind them.
Harry had been slightly worried that Slughorn might be at
breakfast, but he answered his office door at the first knock, wearing a green velvet dressing gown and matching nightcap and looking rather bleary-eyed.
“Harry,” he mumbled. “This is very early for a call. . . . I generally sleep late on a Saturday. . . .”
“Professor, I’m really sorry to disturb you,” said Harry as quietly
as possible, while Ron stood on tiptoe, attempting to see past
Slughorn into his room, “but my friend Ron’s swallowed a love potion by mistake. You couldn’t make him an antidote, could you? I’d
take him to Madam Pomfrey, but we’re not supposed to have anything from Weasleys’ Wizard Wheezes and, you know . . . awkward questions . . .”
“I’d have thought you could have whipped him up a remedy,
Harry, an expert potioneer like you?” asked Slughorn.
“Er,” said Harry, somewhat distracted by the fact that Ron was
now elbowing him in the ribs in an attempt to force his way into
the room, “well, I’ve never mixed an antidote for a love potion,
sir, and by the time I get it right, Ron might’ve done something
serious —”
Helpfully, Ron chose this moment to moan, “I can’t see her,
Harry — is he hiding her?”
“Was this potion within date?” asked Slughorn, now eyeing Ron
with professional interest. “They can strengthen, you know, the
longer they’re kept.”

“That would explain a lot,” panted Harry, now positively
wrestling with Ron to keep him from knocking Slughorn over. “It’s
his birthday, Professor,” he added imploringly.
“Oh, all right, come in, then, come in,” said Slughorn, relenting. “I’ve got the necessary here in my bag, it’s not a difficult
antidote. . . .”
Ron burst through the door into Slughorn’s overheated, crowded
study, tripped over a tasseled footstool, regained his balance by seizing Harry around the neck, and muttered, “She didn’t see that, did
she?”
“She’s not here yet,” said Harry, watching Slughorn opening his
potion kit and adding a few pinches of this and that to a small crystal bottle.
“That’s good,” said Ron fervently. “How do I look?”
“Very handsome,” said Slughorn smoothly, handing Ron a glass
of clear liquid. “Now drink that up, it’s a tonic for the nerves, keep
you calm when she arrives, you know.”
“Brilliant,” said Ron eagerly, and he gulped the antidote down
noisily.
Harry and Slughorn watched him. For a moment, Ron beamed
at them. Then, very slowly, his grin sagged and vanished, to be replaced by an expression of utmost horror.
“Back to normal, then?” said Harry, grinning. Slughorn chuckled. “Thanks a lot, Professor.”
“Don’t mention it, m’boy, don’t mention it,” said Slughorn, as
Ron collapsed into a nearby armchair, looking devastated. “Pickme-up, that’s what he needs,” Slughorn continued, now bustling
over to a table loaded with drinks. “I’ve got butterbeer, I’ve got
wine, I’ve got one last bottle of this oak-matured mead . . . hmm . . .

meant to give that to Dumbledore for Christmas . . . ah, well . . .”
He shrugged. “He can’t miss what he’s never had! Why don’t we
open it now and celebrate Mr. Weasley’s birthday? Nothing like a
fine spirit to chase away the pangs of disappointed love. . . .”
He chortled again, and Harry joined in. This was the first time
he had found himself almost alone with Slughorn since his disastrous first attempt to extract the true memory from him. Perhaps,
if he could just keep Slughorn in a good mood . . . perhaps if they
got through enough of the oak-matured mead . . .
“There you are then,” said Slughorn, handing Harry and Ron a
glass of mead each before raising his own. “Well, a very happy
birthday, Ralph —”
“Ron —” whispered Harry.
But Ron, who did not appear to be listening to the toast, had already thrown the mead into his mouth and swallowed it.
There was one second, hardly more than a heartbeat, in which
Harry knew there was something terribly wrong and Slughorn, it
seemed, did not.
“— and may you have many more —”
“Ron!”
Ron had dropped his glass; he half-rose from his chair and then
crumpled, his extremities jerking uncontrollably. Foam was dribbling from his mouth, and his eyes were bulging from their sockets.
“Professor!” Harry bellowed. “Do something!”
But Slughorn seemed paralyzed by shock. Ron twitched and
choked: His skin was turning blue.
“What — but —” spluttered Slughorn.
Harry leapt over a low table and sprinted toward Slughorn’s
open potion kit, pulling out jars and pouches, while the terrible


sound of Ron’s gargling breath filled the room. Then he found it —
the shriveled kidneylike stone Slughorn had taken from him in
Potions.
He hurtled back to Ron’s side, wrenched open his jaw, and
thrust the bezoar into his mouth. Ron gave a great shudder, a rattling gasp, and his body became limp and still.

o, all in all, not one of Ron’s better birthdays?” said Fred.
It was evening; the hospital wing was quiet, the windows
curtained, the lamps lit. Ron’s was the only occupied bed. Harry,
Hermione, and Ginny were sitting around him; they had spent all
day waiting outside the double doors, trying to see inside whenever
somebody went in or out. Madam Pomfrey had only let them enter at eight o’clock. Fred and George had arrived at ten past.
“This isn’t how we imagined handing over our present,” said
George grimly, putting down a large wrapped gift on Ron’s bedside
cabinet and sitting beside Ginny.
“Yeah, when we pictured the scene, he was conscious,” said Fred.
“There we were in Hogsmeade, waiting to surprise him —” said
George.
“You were in Hogsmeade?” asked Ginny, looking up.
“We were thinking of buying Zonko’s,” said Fred gloomily. “A
Hogsmeade branch, you know, but a fat lot of good it’ll do us if

you lot aren’t allowed out at weekends to buy our stuff anymore.
. . . But never mind that now.”
He drew up a chair beside Harry and looked at Ron’s pale face.
“How exactly did it happen, Harry?”
Harry retold the story he had already recounted, it felt like a
hundred times to Dumbledore, to McGonagall, to Madam Pomfrey, to Hermione, and to Ginny.
“. . . and then I got the bezoar down his throat and his breathing
eased up a bit, Slughorn ran for help, McGonagall and Madam
Pomfrey turned up, and they brought Ron up here. They reckon
he’ll be all right. Madam Pomfrey says he’ll have to stay here a week
or so . . . keep taking essence of rue . . .”
“Blimey, it was lucky you thought of a bezoar,” said George in a
low voice.
“Lucky there was one in the room,” said Harry, who kept turning cold at the thought of what would have happened if he had not
been able to lay hands on the little stone.
Hermione gave an almost inaudible sniff. She had been exceptionally quiet all day. Having hurtled, white-faced, up to Harry
outside the hospital wing and demanded to know what had happened, she had taken almost no part in Harry and Ginny’s obsessive discussion about how Ron had been poisoned, but merely
stood beside them, clench-jawed and frightened-looking, until at
last they had been allowed in to see him.
“Do Mum and Dad know?” Fred asked Ginny.
“They’ve already seen him, they arrived an hour ago — they’re
in Dumbledore’s office now, but they’ll be back soon. . . .”
There was a pause while they all watched Ron mumble a little in
his sleep.

“So the poison was in the drink?” said Fred quietly.
“Yes,” said Harry at once; he could think of nothing else and was
