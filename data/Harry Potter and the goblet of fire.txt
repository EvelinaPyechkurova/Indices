CHAPTER ONE

THE RIDDLE HOUSE

T

he villagers of Little Hangleton still called it “the Riddle
House,” even though it had been many years since the Riddle family had lived there. It stood on a hill overlooking the village,
some of its windows boarded, tiles missing from its roof, and ivy
spreading unchecked over its face. Once a fine-looking manor, and
easily the largest and grandest building for miles around, the Riddle House was now damp, derelict, and unoccupied.
The Little Hangletons all agreed that the old house was “creepy.”
Half a century ago, something strange and horrible had happened
there, something that the older inhabitants of the village still liked
to discuss when topics for gossip were scarce. The story had been
picked over so many times, and had been embroidered in so many
places, that nobody was quite sure what the truth was anymore.
Every version of the tale, however, started in the same place: Fifty
years before, at daybreak on a fine summer’s morning, when the




CHAPTER ONE
Riddle House had still been well kept and impressive, a maid had
entered the drawing room to find all three Riddles dead.
The maid had run screaming down the hill into the village and
roused as many people as she could.
“Lying there with their eyes wide open! Cold as ice! Still in their
dinner things!”
The police were summoned, and the whole of Little Hangleton
had seethed with shocked curiosity and ill-disguised excitement.
Nobody wasted their breath pretending to feel very sad about the
Riddles, for they had been most unpopular. Elderly Mr. and Mrs.
Riddle had been rich, snobbish, and rude, and their grown-up son,
Tom, had been, if anything, worse. All the villagers cared about was
the identity of their murderer — for plainly, three apparently
healthy people did not all drop dead of natural causes on the same
night.
The Hanged Man, the village pub, did a roaring trade that
night; the whole village seemed to have turned out to discuss the
murders. They were rewarded for leaving their firesides when the
Riddles’ cook arrived dramatically in their midst and announced
to the suddenly silent pub that a man called Frank Bryce had just
been arrested.
“Frank!” cried several people. “Never!”
Frank Bryce was the Riddles’ gardener. He lived alone in a rundown cottage on the grounds of the Riddle House. Frank had
come back from the war with a very stiff leg and a great dislike of
crowds and loud noises, and had been working for the Riddles ever
since.
There was a rush to buy the cook drinks and hear more details.
“Always thought he was odd,” she told the eagerly listening vil



THE RIDDLE HOUSE
lagers, after her fourth sherry. “Unfriendly, like. I’m sure if I’ve offered him a cuppa once, I’ve offered it a hundred times. Never
wanted to mix, he didn’t.”
“Ah, now,” said a woman at the bar, “he had a hard war, Frank.
He likes the quiet life. That’s no reason to —”
“Who else had a key to the back door, then?” barked the cook.
“There’s been a spare key hanging in the gardener’s cottage far back
as I can remember! Nobody forced the door last night! No broken
windows! All Frank had to do was creep up to the big house while
we was all sleeping. . . .”
The villagers exchanged dark looks.
“I always thought he had a nasty look about him, right enough,”
grunted a man at the bar.
“War turned him funny, if you ask me,” said the landlord.
“Told you I wouldn’t like to get on the wrong side of Frank,
didn’t I, Dot?” said an excited woman in the corner.
“Horrible temper,” said Dot, nodding fervently. “I remember,
when he was a kid . . .”
By the following morning, hardly anyone in Little Hangleton
doubted that Frank Bryce had killed the Riddles.
But over in the neighboring town of Great Hangleton, in the
dark and dingy police station, Frank was stubbornly repeating,
again and again, that he was innocent, and that the only person he
had seen near the house on the day of the Riddles’ deaths had been
a teenage boy, a stranger, dark-haired and pale. Nobody else in the
village had seen any such boy, and the police were quite sure that
Frank had invented him.
Then, just when things were looking very serious for Frank, the
report on the Riddles’ bodies came back and changed everything.


3



CHAPTER ONE
The police had never read an odder report. A team of doctors
had examined the bodies and had concluded that none of the Riddles had been poisoned, stabbed, shot, strangled, suffocated, or (as
far as they could tell) harmed at all. In fact (the report continued,
in a tone of unmistakable bewilderment), the Riddles all appeared
to be in perfect health — apart from the fact that they were all
dead. The doctors did note (as though determined to find something wrong with the bodies) that each of the Riddles had a look of
terror upon his or her face — but as the frustrated police said,
whoever heard of three people being frightened to death?
As there was no proof that the Riddles had been murdered at all,
the police were forced to let Frank go. The Riddles were buried in
the Little Hangleton churchyard, and their graves remained objects
of curiosity for a while. To everyone’s surprise, and amid a cloud of
suspicion, Frank Bryce returned to his cottage on the grounds of the
Riddle House.
“ ’S far as I’m concerned, he killed them, and I don’t care what
the police say,” said Dot in the Hanged Man. “And if he had any
decency, he’d leave here, knowing as how we knows he did it.”
But Frank did not leave. He stayed to tend the garden for the
next family who lived in the Riddle House, and then the next —
for neither family stayed long. Perhaps it was partly because of
Frank that the new owners said there was a nasty feeling about the
place, which, in the absence of inhabitants, started to fall into
disrepair.
The wealthy man who owned the Riddle House these days neither
lived there nor put it to any use; they said in the village that he kept
it for “tax reasons,” though nobody was very clear what these might




THE RIDDLE HOUSE
be. The wealthy owner continued to pay Frank to do the gardening, however. Frank was nearing his seventy-seventh birthday now,
very deaf, his bad leg stiffer than ever, but could be seen pottering
around the flower beds in fine weather, even though the weeds were
starting to creep up on him, try as he might to suppress them.
Weeds were not the only things Frank had to contend with either. Boys from the village made a habit of throwing stones
through the windows of the Riddle House. They rode their bicycles
over the lawns Frank worked so hard to keep smooth. Once or
twice, they broke into the old house for a dare. They knew that old
Frank’s devotion to the house and grounds amounted almost to an
obsession, and it amused them to see him limping across the garden, brandishing his stick and yelling croakily at them. Frank, for
his part, believed the boys tormented him because they, like their
parents and grandparents, thought him a murderer. So when Frank
awoke one night in August and saw something very odd up at the
old house, he merely assumed that the boys had gone one step further in their attempts to punish him.
It was Frank’s bad leg that woke him; it was paining him worse
than ever in his old age. He got up and limped downstairs into the
kitchen with the idea of refilling his hot-water bottle to ease the
stiffness in his knee. Standing at the sink, filling the kettle, he
looked up at the Riddle House and saw lights glimmering in its upper windows. Frank knew at once what was going on. The boys
had broken into the house again, and judging by the flickering
quality of the light, they had started a fire.
Frank had no telephone, and in any case, he had deeply mistrusted the police ever since they had taken him in for questioning
about the Riddles’ deaths. He put down the kettle at once, hurried


5



CHAPTER ONE
back upstairs as fast as his bad leg would allow, and was soon back
in his kitchen, fully dressed and removing a rusty old key from its
hook by the door. He picked up his walking stick, which was
propped against the wall, and set off into the night.
The front door of the Riddle House bore no sign of being
forced, nor did any of the windows. Frank limped around to the
back of the house until he reached a door almost completely hidden by ivy, took out the old key, put it into the lock, and opened
the door noiselessly.
He let himself into the cavernous kitchen. Frank had not entered it for many years; nevertheless, although it was very dark, he
remembered where the door into the hall was, and he groped his
way toward it, his nostrils full of the smell of decay, ears pricked for
any sound of footsteps or voices from overhead. He reached the
hall, which was a little lighter owing to the large mullioned windows on either side of the front door, and started to climb the
stairs, blessing the dust that lay thick upon the stone, because it
muffled the sound of his feet and stick.
On the landing, Frank turned right, and saw at once where the
intruders were: At the very end of the passage a door stood ajar, and
a flickering light shone through the gap, casting a long sliver of
gold across the black floor. Frank edged closer and closer, grasping
his walking stick firmly. Several feet from the entrance, he was able
to see a narrow slice of the room beyond.
The fire, he now saw, had been lit in the grate. This surprised
him. Then he stopped moving and listened intently, for a man’s
voice spoke within the room; it sounded timid and fearful.
“There is a little more in the bottle, My Lord, if you are still
hungry.”


6



THE RIDDLE HOUSE
“Later,” said a second voice. This too belonged to a man — but
it was strangely high-pitched, and cold as a sudden blast of icy
wind. Something about that voice made the sparse hairs on the
back of Frank’s neck stand up. “Move me closer to the fire,
Wormtail.”
Frank turned his right ear toward the door, the better to hear.
There came the clink of a bottle being put down upon some hard
surface, and then the dull scraping noise of a heavy chair being
dragged across the floor. Frank caught a glimpse of a small man, his
back to the door, pushing the chair into place. He was wearing a
long black cloak, and there was a bald patch at the back of his head.
Then he went out of sight again.
“Where is Nagini?” said the cold voice.
“I — I don’t know, My Lord,” said the first voice nervously. “She
set out to explore the house, I think. . . .”
“You will milk her before we retire, Wormtail,” said the second
voice. “I will need feeding in the night. The journey has tired me
greatly.”
Brow furrowed, Frank inclined his good ear still closer to the
door, listening very hard. There was a pause, and then the man
called Wormtail spoke again.
“My Lord, may I ask how long we are going to stay here?”
“A week,” said the cold voice. “Perhaps longer. The place is moderately comfortable, and the plan cannot proceed yet. It would be
foolish to act before the Quidditch World Cup is over.”
Frank inserted a gnarled finger into his ear and rotated it. Owing, no doubt, to a buildup of earwax, he had heard the word
“Quidditch,” which was not a word at all.
“The — the Quidditch World Cup, My Lord?” said Wormtail.


7



CHAPTER ONE
(Frank dug his finger still more vigorously into his ear.) “Forgive
me, but — I do not understand — why should we wait until the
World Cup is over?”
“Because, fool, at this very moment wizards are pouring into the
country from all over the world, and every meddler from the Ministry of Magic will be on duty, on the watch for signs of unusual activity, checking and double-checking identities. They will be
obsessed with security, lest the Muggles notice anything. So we
wait.”
Frank stopped trying to clear out his ear. He had distinctly heard
the words “Ministry of Magic,” “wizards,” and “Muggles.” Plainly,
each of these expressions meant something secret, and Frank could
think of only two sorts of people who would speak in code: spies
and criminals. Frank tightened his hold on his walking stick once
more, and listened more closely still.
“Your Lordship is still determined, then?” Wormtail said quietly.
“Certainly I am determined, Wormtail.” There was a note of
menace in the cold voice now.
A slight pause followed — and then Wormtail spoke, the words
tumbling from him in a rush, as though he was forcing himself to
say this before he lost his nerve.
“It could be done without Harry Potter, My Lord.”
Another pause, more protracted, and then —
“Without Harry Potter?” breathed the second voice softly. “I
see . . .”
“My Lord, I do not say this out of concern for the boy!” said
Wormtail, his voice rising squeakily. “The boy is nothing to me,
nothing at all! It is merely that if we were to use another witch or


8



THE RIDDLE HOUSE
wizard — any wizard — the thing could be done so much more
quickly! If you allowed me to leave you for a short while — you
know that I can disguise myself most effectively — I could be back
here in as little as two days with a suitable person —”
“I could use another wizard,” said the cold voice softly, “that is
true. . . .”
“My Lord, it makes sense,” said Wormtail, sounding thoroughly
relieved now. “Laying hands on Harry Potter would be so difficult,
he is so well protected —”
“And so you volunteer to go and fetch me a substitute? I wonder . . . perhaps the task of nursing me has become wearisome for
you, “Wormtail? Could this suggestion of abandoning the plan be
nothing more than an attempt to desert me?”
“My Lord! I — I have no wish to leave you, none at all —”
“Do not lie to me!” hissed the second voice. “I can always tell,
Wormtail! You are regretting that you ever returned to me. I revolt
you. I see you flinch when you look at me, feel you shudder when
you touch me. . . .”
“No! My devotion to Your Lordship —”
“Your devotion is nothing more than cowardice. You would not
be here if you had anywhere else to go. How am I to survive without you, when I need feeding every few hours? Who is to milk
Nagini?”
“But you seem so much stronger, My Lord —”
“Liar,” breathed the second voice. “I am no stronger, and a few
days alone would be enough to rob me of the little health I have regained under your clumsy care. Silence!”
Wormtail, who had been sputtering incoherently, fell silent at


9



CHAPTER ONE
once. For a few seconds, Frank could hear nothing but the fire
crackling. Then the second man spoke once more, in a whisper
that was almost a hiss.
“I have my reasons for using the boy, as I have already explained
to you, and I will use no other. I have waited thirteen years. A few
more months will make no difference. As for the protection surrounding the boy, I believe my plan will be effective. All that is
needed is a little courage from you, Wormtail — courage you will
find, unless you wish to feel the full extent of Lord Voldemort’s
wrath —”
“My Lord, I must speak!” said Wormtail, panic in his voice now.
“All through our journey I have gone over the plan in my head —
My Lord, Bertha Jorkins’s disappearance will not go unnoticed for
long, and if we proceed, if I murder —”
“If?” whispered the second voice. “If ? If you follow the plan,
Wormtail, the Ministry need never know that anyone else has died.
You will do it quietly and without fuss; I only wish that I could do
it myself, but in my present condition . . . Come, Wormtail, one
more death and our path to Harry Potter is clear. I am not asking
you to do it alone. By that time, my faithful servant will have rejoined us —”
“I am a faithful servant,” said Wormtail, the merest trace of sullenness in his voice.
“Wormtail, I need somebody with brains, somebody whose loyalty has never wavered, and you, unfortunately, fulfill neither
requirement.”
“I found you,” said Wormtail, and there was definitely a sulky
edge to his voice now. “I was the one who found you. I brought
you Bertha Jorkins.”


10



THE RIDDLE HOUSE
“That is true,” said the second man, sounding amused. “A stroke
of brilliance I would not have thought possible from you, Wormtail — though, if truth be told, you were not aware how useful she
would be when you caught her, were you?”
“I — I thought she might be useful, My Lord —”
“Liar,” said the second voice again, the cruel amusement more
pronounced than ever. “However, I do not deny that her information was invaluable. Without it, I could never have formed our
plan, and for that, you will have your reward, Wormtail. I will allow you to perform an essential task for me, one that many of my
followers would give their right hands to perform. . . .”
“R-really, My Lord? What — ?” Wormtail sounded terrified
again.
“Ah, Wormtail, you don’t want me to spoil the surprise? Your
part will come at the very end . . . but I promise you, you will have
the honor of being just as useful as Bertha Jorkins.”
“You . . . you . . .” Wormtail’s voice suddenly sounded hoarse, as
though his mouth had gone very dry. “You . . . are going . . . to kill
me too?”
“Wormtail, Wormtail,” said the cold voice silkily, “why would I
kill you? I killed Bertha because I had to. She was fit for nothing after my questioning, quite useless. In any case, awkward questions
would have been asked if she had gone back to the Ministry with
the news that she had met you on her holidays. Wizards who are
supposed to be dead would do well not to run into Ministry of
Magic witches at wayside inns. . . .”
Wormtail muttered something so quietly that Frank could not
hear it, but it made the second man laugh — an entirely mirthless
laugh, cold as his speech.


11



CHAPTER ONE
“We could have modified her memory? But Memory Charms can
be broken by a powerful wizard, as I proved when I questioned her.
It would be an insult to her memory not to use the information I extracted from her, Wormtail.”
Out in the corridor, Frank suddenly became aware that the hand
gripping his walking stick was slippery with sweat. The man with
the cold voice had killed a woman. He was talking about it without
any kind of remorse — with amusement. He was dangerous — a
madman. And he was planning more murders — this boy, Harry
Potter, whoever he was — was in danger —
Frank knew what he must do. Now, if ever, was the time to go to
the police. He would creep out of the house and head straight for
the telephone box in the village . . . but the cold voice was speaking
again, and Frank remained where he was, frozen to the spot, listening with all his might.
“One more murder . . . my faithful servant at Hogwarts . . .
Harry Potter is as good as mine, Wormtail. It is decided. There will
be no more argument. But quiet . . . I think I hear Nagini. . . .”
And the second man’s voice changed. He started making noises
such as Frank had never heard before; he was hissing and spitting
without drawing breath. Frank thought he must be having some
sort of fit or seizure.
And then Frank heard movement behind him in the dark passageway. He turned to look, and found himself paralyzed with
fright.
Something was slithering toward him along the dark corridor
floor, and as it drew nearer to the sliver of firelight, he realized with
a thrill of terror that it was a gigantic snake, at least twelve feet
long. Horrified, transfixed, Frank stared as its undulating body cut


12



THE RIDDLE HOUSE
a wide, curving track through the thick dust on the floor, coming
closer and closer — What was he to do? The only means of escape
was into the room where two men sat plotting murder, yet if he
stayed where he was the snake would surely kill him —
But before he had made his decision, the snake was level with
him, and then, incredibly, miraculously, it was passing; it was following the spitting, hissing noises made by the cold voice beyond
the door, and in seconds, the tip of its diamond-patterned tail had
vanished through the gap.
There was sweat on Frank’s forehead now, and the hand on the
walking stick was trembling. Inside the room, the cold voice was
continuing to hiss, and Frank was visited by a strange idea, an impossible idea. . . . This man could talk to snakes.
Frank didn’t understand what was going on. He wanted more
than anything to be back in his bed with his hot-water bottle. The
problem was that his legs didn’t seem to want to move. As he stood
there shaking and trying to master himself, the cold voice switched
abruptly to English again.
“Nagini has interesting news, Wormtail,” it said.
“In-indeed, My Lord?” said Wormtail.
“Indeed, yes,” said the voice. “According to Nagini, there is an
old Muggle standing right outside this room, listening to every
word we say.”
Frank didn’t have a chance to hide himself. There were footsteps,
and then the door of the room was flung wide open.
A short, balding man with graying hair, a pointed nose, and
small, watery eyes stood before Frank, a mixture of fear and alarm
in his face.
“Invite him inside, Wormtail. Where are your manners?”


13



CHAPTER ONE
The cold voice was coming from the ancient armchair before the
fire, but Frank couldn’t see the speaker. The snake, on the other
hand, was curled up on the rotting hearth rug, like some horrible
travesty of a pet dog.
Wormtail beckoned Frank into the room. Though still deeply
shaken, Frank took a firmer grip upon his walking stick and limped
over the threshold.
The fire was the only source of light in the room; it cast long,
spidery shadows upon the walls. Frank stared at the back of the
armchair; the man inside it seemed to be even smaller than his servant, for Frank couldn’t even see the back of his head.
“You heard everything, Muggle?” said the cold voice.
“What’s that you’re calling me?” said Frank defiantly, for now
that he was inside the room, now that the time had come for some
sort of action, he felt braver; it had always been so in the war.
“I am calling you a Muggle,” said the voice coolly. “It means that
you are not a wizard.”
“I don’t know what you mean by wizard,” said Frank, his voice
growing steadier. “All I know is I’ve heard enough to interest the
police tonight, I have. You’ve done murder and you’re planning
more! And I’ll tell you this too,” he added, on a sudden inspiration,
“my wife knows I’m up here, and if I don’t come back —”
“You have no wife,” said the cold voice, very quietly. “Nobody
knows you are here. You told nobody that you were coming. Do
not lie to Lord Voldemort, Muggle, for he knows . . . he always
knows. . . .”
“Is that right?” said Frank roughly. “Lord, is it? Well, I don’t
think much of your manners, My Lord. Turn ’round and face me
like a man, why don’t you?”


14



THE RIDDLE HOUSE
“But I am not a man, Muggle,” said the cold voice, barely audible now over the crackling of the flames. “I am much, much more
than a man. However . . . why not? I will face you. . . . Wormtail,
come turn my chair around.”
The servant gave a whimper.
“You heard me, Wormtail.”
Slowly, with his face screwed up, as though he would rather have
done anything than approach his master and the hearth rug where
the snake lay, the small man walked forward and began to turn the
chair. The snake lifted its ugly triangular head and hissed slightly as
the legs of the chair snagged on its rug.
And then the chair was facing Frank, and he saw what was sitting in it. His walking stick fell to the floor with a clatter. He
opened his mouth and let out a scream. He was screaming so
loudly that he never heard the words the thing in the chair spoke as
it raised a wand. There was a flash of green light, a rushing sound,
and Frank Bryce crumpled. He was dead before he hit the floor.
Two hundred miles away, the boy called Harry Potter woke with
a start.

CHAPTER TWO

THE SCAR

H

arry lay flat on his back, breathing hard as though he had
been running. He had awoken from a vivid dream with
his hands pressed over his face. The old scar on his forehead, which
was shaped like a bolt of lightning, was burning beneath his fingers
as though someone had just pressed a white-hot wire to his skin.
He sat up, one hand still on his scar, the other reaching out in
the darkness for his glasses, which were on the bedside table. He
put them on and his bedroom came into clearer focus, lit by a faint,
misty orange light that was filtering through the curtains from the
street lamp outside the window.
Harry ran his fingers over the scar again. It was still painful. He
turned on the lamp beside him, scrambled out of bed, crossed the
room, opened his wardrobe, and peered into the mirror on the inside of the door. A skinny boy of fourteen looked back at him, his
bright green eyes puzzled under his untidy black hair. He examined


16



THE SCAR
the lightning-bolt scar of his reflection more closely. It looked
normal, but it was still stinging.
Harry tried to recall what he had been dreaming about before he
had awoken. It had seemed so real. . . . There had been two people
he knew and one he didn’t. . . . He concentrated hard, frowning,
trying to remember. . . .
The dim picture of a darkened room came to him. . . . There
had been a snake on a hearth rug . . . a small man called Peter,
nicknamed Wormtail . . . and a cold, high voice . . . the voice of
Lord Voldemort. Harry felt as though an ice cube had slipped
down into his stomach at the very thought. . . .
He closed his eyes tightly and tried to remember what Voldemort had looked like, but it was impossible. . . . All Harry knew
was that at the moment when Voldemort’s chair had swung
around, and he, Harry, had seen what was sitting in it, he had felt
a spasm of horror, which had awoken him . . . or had that been the
pain in his scar?
And who had the old man been? For there had definitely been an
old man; Harry had watched him fall to the ground. It was all becoming confused. Harry put his face into his hands, blocking out
his bedroom, trying to hold on to the picture of that dimly lit
room, but it was like trying to keep water in his cupped hands; the
details were now trickling away as fast as he tried to hold on to
them. . . . Voldemort and Wormtail had been talking about someone they had killed, though Harry could not remember the
name . . . and they had been plotting to kill someone else . . . him!
Harry took his face out of his hands, opened his eyes, and stared
around his bedroom as though expecting to see something unusual


CHAPTER TWO
there. As it happened, there were an extraordinary number of unusual things in this room. A large wooden trunk stood open at the
foot of his bed, revealing a cauldron, broomstick, black robes, and
assorted spellbooks. Rolls of parchment littered that part of his
desk that was not taken up by the large, empty cage in which his
snowy owl, Hedwig, usually perched. On the floor beside his bed a
book lay open; Harry had been reading it before he fell asleep last
night. The pictures in this book were all moving. Men in bright orange robes were zooming in and out of sight on broomsticks,
throwing a red ball to one another.
Harry walked over to the book, picked it up, and watched one
of the wizards score a spectacular goal by putting the ball through
a fifty-foot-high hoop. Then he snapped the book shut. Even
Quidditch — in Harry’s opinion, the best sport in the world —
couldn’t distract him at the moment. He placed Flying with the
Cannons on his bedside table, crossed to the window, and drew
back the curtains to survey the street below.
Privet Drive looked exactly as a respectable suburban street
would be expected to look in the early hours of Saturday morning.
All the curtains were closed. As far as Harry could see through the
darkness, there wasn’t a living creature in sight, not even a cat.
And yet . . . and yet . . . Harry went restlessly back to the bed
and sat down on it, running a finger over his scar again. It wasn’t
the pain that bothered him; Harry was no stranger to pain and injury. He had lost all the bones from his right arm once and had
them painfully regrown in a night. The same arm had been pierced
by a venomous foot-long fang not long afterward. Only last year
Harry had fallen fifty feet from an airborne broomstick. He was
used to bizarre accidents and injuries; they were unavoidable if you


THE SCAR
attended Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry and had a
knack for attracting a lot of trouble.
No, the thing that was bothering Harry was that the last time his
scar had hurt him, it had been because Voldemort had been close
by. . . . But Voldemort couldn’t be here, now. . . . The idea of
Voldemort lurking in Privet Drive was absurd, impossible. . . .
Harry listened closely to the silence around him. Was he halfexpecting to hear the creak of a stair or the swish of a cloak? And
then he jumped slightly as he heard his cousin Dudley give a
tremendous grunting snore from the next room.
Harry shook himself mentally; he was being stupid. There was
no one in the house with him except Uncle Vernon, Aunt Petunia,
and Dudley, and they were plainly still asleep, their dreams untroubled and painless.
Asleep was the way Harry liked the Dursleys best; it wasn’t as
though they were ever any help to him awake. Uncle Vernon, Aunt
Petunia, and Dudley were Harry’s only living relatives. They were
Muggles who hated and despised magic in any form, which meant
that Harry was about as welcome in their house as dry rot. They
had explained away Harry’s long absences at Hogwarts over the last
three years by telling everyone that he went to St. Brutus’s Secure
Center for Incurably Criminal Boys. They knew perfectly well
that, as an underage wizard, Harry wasn’t allowed to use magic outside Hogwarts, but they were still apt to blame him for anything
that went wrong about the house. Harry had never been able to
confide in them or tell them anything about his life in the wizarding world. The very idea of going to them when they awoke, and
telling them about his scar hurting him, and about his worries
about Voldemort, was laughable.


19

CHAPTER TWO
And yet it was because of Voldemort that Harry had come to live
with the Dursleys in the first place. If it hadn’t been for Voldemort,
Harry would not have had the lightning scar on his forehead. If it
hadn’t been for Voldemort, Harry would still have had parents. . . .
Harry had been a year old the night that Voldemort — the most
powerful Dark wizard for a century, a wizard who had been gaining power steadily for eleven years — arrived at his house and
killed his father and mother. Voldemort had then turned his wand
on Harry; he had performed the curse that had disposed of many
full-grown witches and wizards in his steady rise to power — and,
incredibly, it had not worked. Instead of killing the small boy, the
curse had rebounded upon Voldemort. Harry had survived with
nothing but a lightning-shaped cut on his forehead, and Voldemort had been reduced to something barely alive. His powers gone,
his life almost extinguished, Voldemort had fled; the terror in
which the secret community of witches and wizards had lived for
so long had lifted, Voldemort’s followers had disbanded, and Harry
Potter had become famous.
It had been enough of a shock for Harry to discover, on his
eleventh birthday, that he was a wizard; it had been even more disconcerting to find out that everyone in the hidden wizarding world
knew his name. Harry had arrived at Hogwarts to find that heads
turned and whispers followed him wherever he went. But he was
used to it now: At the end of this summer, he would be starting his
fourth year at Hogwarts, and Harry was already counting the days
until he would be back at the castle again.
But there was still a fortnight to go before he went back to
school. He looked hopelessly around his room again, and his eye


20



THE SCAR
paused on the birthday cards his two best friends had sent him at
the end of July. What would they say if Harry wrote to them and
told them about his scar hurting?
At once, Hermione Granger’s voice seemed to fill his head, shrill
and panicky.
“Your scar hurt? Harry, that’s really serious. . . . Write to Professor
Dumbledore! And I’ll go and check Common Magical Ailments and
Afflictions. . . . Maybe there’s something in there about curse scars. . . .”
Yes, that would be Hermione’s advice: Go straight to the headmaster of Hogwarts, and in the meantime, consult a book. Harry
stared out of the window at the inky blue-black sky. He doubted
very much whether a book could help him now. As far as he knew,
he was the only living person to have survived a curse like Voldemort’s; it was highly unlikely, therefore, that he would find his
symptoms listed in Common Magical Ailments and Afflictions. As
for informing the headmaster, Harry had no idea where Dumbledore went during the summer holidays. He amused himself for a
moment, picturing Dumbledore, with his long silver beard, fulllength wizard’s robes, and pointed hat, stretched out on a beach
somewhere, rubbing suntan lotion onto his long crooked nose.
Wherever Dumbledore was, though, Harry was sure that Hedwig
would be able to find him; Harry’s owl had never yet failed to deliver a letter to anyone, even without an address. But what would
he write?
Dear Professor Dumbledore, Sorry to bother you, but my scar hurt
this morning. Yours sincerely, Harry Potter.
Even inside his head the words sounded stupid.
And so he tried to imagine his other best friend, Ron Weasley’s,


21



CHAPTER TWO
reaction, and in a moment, Ron’s red hair and long-nosed, freckled
face seemed to swim before Harry, wearing a bemused expression.
“Your scar hurt? But . . . but You-Know-Who can’t be near you
now, can he? I mean . . . you’d know, wouldn’t you? He’d be trying to
do you in again, wouldn’t he? I dunno, Harry, maybe curse scars always
twinge a bit. . . . I’ll ask Dad. . . .”
Mr. Weasley was a fully qualified wizard who worked in the
Misuse of Muggle Artifacts Office at the Ministry of Magic, but he
didn’t have any particular expertise in the matter of curses, as far as
Harry knew. In any case, Harry didn’t like the idea of the whole
Weasley family knowing that he, Harry, was getting jumpy about
a few moments’ pain. Mrs. Weasley would fuss worse than
Hermione, and Fred and George, Ron’s sixteen-year-old twin
brothers, might think Harry was losing his nerve. The Weasleys
were Harry’s favorite family in the world; he was hoping that they
might invite him to stay any time now (Ron had mentioned something about the Quidditch World Cup), and he somehow didn’t
want his visit punctuated with anxious inquiries about his scar.
Harry kneaded his forehead with his knuckles. What he really
wanted (and it felt almost shameful to admit it to himself) was
someone like — someone like a parent: an adult wizard whose advice he could ask without feeling stupid, someone who cared about
him, who had had experience with Dark Magic. . . .
And then the solution came to him. It was so simple, and so obvious, that he couldn’t believe it had taken so long — Sirius.
Harry leapt up from the bed, hurried across the room, and sat
down at his desk; he pulled a piece of parchment toward him,
loaded his eagle-feather quill with ink, wrote Dear Sirius, then
paused, wondering how best to phrase his problem, still marveling


22



THE SCAR
at the fact that he hadn’t thought of Sirius straight away. But then,
perhaps it wasn’t so surprising — after all, he had only found out
that Sirius was his godfather two months ago.
There was a simple reason for Sirius’s complete absence from
Harry’s life until then — Sirius had been in Azkaban, the terrifying
wizard jail guarded by creatures called dementors, sightless, soulsucking fiends who had come to search for Sirius at Hogwarts
when he had escaped. Yet Sirius had been innocent — the murders
for which he had been convicted had been committed by Wormtail, Voldemort’s supporter, whom nearly everybody now believed
dead. Harry, Ron, and Hermione knew otherwise, however; they
had come face-to-face with Wormtail only the previous year,
though only Professor Dumbledore had believed their story.
For one glorious hour, Harry had believed that he was leaving
the Dursleys at last, because Sirius had offered him a home once his
name had been cleared. But the chance had been snatched away
from him — Wormtail had escaped before they could take him to
the Ministry of Magic, and Sirius had had to flee for his life. Harry
had helped him escape on the back of a hippogriff called Buckbeak,
and since then, Sirius had been on the run. The home Harry might
have had if Wormtail had not escaped had been haunting him all
summer. It had been doubly hard to return to the Dursleys knowing that he had so nearly escaped them forever.
Nevertheless, Sirius had been of some help to Harry, even if he
couldn’t be with him. It was due to Sirius that Harry now had all
his school things in his bedroom with him. The Dursleys had never
allowed this before; their general wish of keeping Harry as miserable as possible, coupled with their fear of his powers, had led them
to lock his school trunk in the cupboard under the stairs every


23



CHAPTER TWO
summer prior to this. But their attitude had changed since they
had found out that Harry had a dangerous murderer for a godfather — for Harry had conveniently forgotten to tell them that
Sirius was innocent.
Harry had received two letters from Sirius since he had been
back at Privet Drive. Both had been delivered, not by owls (as was
usual with wizards), but by large, brightly colored tropical birds.
Hedwig had not approved of these flashy intruders; she had been
most reluctant to allow them to drink from her water tray before
flying off again. Harry, on the other hand, had liked them; they put
him in mind of palm trees and white sand, and he hoped that,
wherever Sirius was (Sirius never said, in case the letters were intercepted), he was enjoying himself. Somehow, Harry found it hard to
imagine dementors surviving for long in bright sunlight; perhaps
that was why Sirius had gone south. Sirius’s letters, which were now
hidden beneath the highly useful loose floorboard under Harry’s
bed, sounded cheerful, and in both of them he had reminded
Harry to call on him if ever Harry needed to. Well, he needed to
now, all right. . . .
Harry’s lamp seemed to grow dimmer as the cold gray light that
precedes sunrise slowly crept into the room. Finally, when the sun
had risen, when his bedroom walls had turned gold, and when
sounds of movement could be heard from Uncle Vernon and Aunt
Petunia’s room, Harry cleared his desk of crumpled pieces of parchment and reread his finished letter.
Dear Sirius,
Thanks for your last letter. That bird was enormous; it
could hardly get through my window.

THE SCAR
Things are the same as usual here. Dudley’s diet isn’t going
too well. My aunt found him smuggling doughnuts into his
room yesterday. They told him they’d have to cut his pocket
money if he keeps doing it, so he got really angry and chucked
his PlayStation out of the window. That’s a sort of computer
thing you can play games on. Bit stupid really, now he hasn’t
even got Mega-Mutilation Part Three to take his mind off
things.
I’m okay, mainly because the Dursleys are terrified you
might turn up and turn them all into bats if I ask you to.
A weird thing happened this morning, though. My scar
hurt again. Last time that happened it was because Voldemort
was at Hogwarts. But I don’t reckon he can be anywhere near
me now, can he? Do you know if curse scars sometimes hurt
years afterward ?
I’ll send this with Hedwig when she gets back; she’s off hunting at the moment. Say hello to Buckbeak for me.

Yes, thought Harry, that looked all right. There was no point
putting in the dream; he didn’t want it to look as though he was too
worried. He folded up the parchment and laid it aside on his desk,
ready for when Hedwig returned. Then he got to his feet, stretched,
and opened his wardrobe once more. Without glancing at his reflection, he started to get dressed before going down to breakfast.

CHAPTER THREE

THE INVITATION

B

y the time Harry arrived in the kitchen, the three Dursleys
were already seated around the table. None of them looked up
as he entered or sat down. Uncle Vernon’s large red face was hidden
behind the morning’s Daily Mail, and Aunt Petunia was cutting a
grapefruit into quarters, her lips pursed over her horselike teeth.
Dudley looked furious and sulky, and somehow seemed to be
taking up even more space than usual. This was saying something,
as he always took up an entire side of the square table by himself.
When Aunt Petunia put a quarter of unsweetened grapefruit onto
Dudley’s plate with a tremulous “There you are, Diddy darling,”
Dudley glowered at her. His life had taken a most unpleasant turn
since he had come home for the summer with his end-of-year
report.
Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia had managed to find excuses
for his bad marks as usual: Aunt Petunia always insisted that Dudley was a very gifted boy whose teachers didn’t understand him,


26



THE INVITATION
while Uncle Vernon maintained that “he didn’t want some swotty
little nancy boy for a son anyway.” They also skated over the accusations of bullying in the report — “He’s a boisterous little boy, but
he wouldn’t hurt a fly!” Aunt Petunia had said tearfully.
However, at the bottom of the report there were a few wellchosen comments from the school nurse that not even Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia could explain away. No matter how much
Aunt Petunia wailed that Dudley was big-boned, and that his
poundage was really puppy fat, and that he was a growing boy who
needed plenty of food, the fact remained that the school outfitters
didn’t stock knickerbockers big enough for him anymore. The
school nurse had seen what Aunt Petunia’s eyes — so sharp when it
came to spotting fingerprints on her gleaming walls, and in observing the comings and goings of the neighbors — simply refused
to see: that far from needing extra nourishment, Dudley had
reached roughly the size and weight of a young killer whale.
So — after many tantrums, after arguments that shook Harry’s
bedroom floor, and many tears from Aunt Petunia — the new
regime had begun. The diet sheet that had been sent by the Smeltings school nurse had been taped to the fridge, which had been
emptied of all Dudley’s favorite things — fizzy drinks and cakes,
chocolate bars and burgers — and filled instead with fruit and vegetables and the sorts of things that Uncle Vernon called “rabbit
food.” To make Dudley feel better about it all, Aunt Petunia had
insisted that the whole family follow the diet too. She now passed
a grapefruit quarter to Harry. He noticed that it was a lot smaller
than Dudley’s. Aunt Petunia seemed to feel that the best way to
keep up Dudley’s morale was to make sure that he did, at least, get
more to eat than Harry.


27



CHAPTER THREE
But Aunt Petunia didn’t know what was hidden under the loose
floorboard upstairs. She had no idea that Harry was not following
the diet at all. The moment he had got wind of the fact that he was
expected to survive the summer on carrot sticks, Harry had sent
Hedwig to his friends with pleas for help, and they had risen to the
occasion magnificently. Hedwig had returned from Hermione’s
house with a large box stuffed full of sugar-free snacks. (Hermione’s
parents were dentists.) Hagrid, the Hogwarts gamekeeper, had
obliged with a sack full of his own homemade rock cakes. (Harry
hadn’t touched these; he had had too much experience of Hagrid’s
cooking.) Mrs. Weasley, however, had sent the family owl, Errol,
with an enormous fruitcake and assorted meat pies. Poor Errol, who
was elderly and feeble, had needed a full five days to recover from
the journey. And then on Harry’s birthday (which the Dursleys had
completely ignored) he had received four superb birthday cakes,
one each from Ron, Hermione, Hagrid, and Sirius. Harry still had
two of them left, and so, looking forward to a real breakfast when he
got back upstairs, he ate his grapefruit without complaint.
Uncle Vernon laid aside his paper with a deep sniff of disapproval and looked down at his own grapefruit quarter.
“Is this it?” he said grumpily to Aunt Petunia.
Aunt Petunia gave him a severe look, and then nodded pointedly
at Dudley, who had already finished his own grapefruit quarter and
was eyeing Harry’s with a very sour look in his piggy little eyes.
Uncle Vernon gave a great sigh, which ruffled his large, bushy
mustache, and picked up his spoon.
The doorbell rang. Uncle Vernon heaved himself out of his chair
and set off down the hall. Quick as a flash, while his mother was


28



THE INVITATION
occupied with the kettle, Dudley stole the rest of Uncle Vernon’s
grapefruit.
Harry heard talking at the door, and someone laughing, and
Uncle Vernon answering curtly. Then the front door closed, and
the sound of ripping paper came from the hall.
Aunt Petunia set the teapot down on the table and looked curiously around to see where Uncle Vernon had got to. She didn’t have
to wait long to find out; after about a minute, he was back. He
looked livid.
“You,” he barked at Harry. “In the living room. Now.”
Bewildered, wondering what on earth he was supposed to have
done this time, Harry got up and followed Uncle Vernon out of the
kitchen and into the next room. Uncle Vernon closed the door
sharply behind both of them.
“So,” he said, marching over to the fireplace and turning to face
Harry as though he were about to pronounce him under arrest.
“So.”
Harry would have dearly loved to have said, “So what?” but he
didn’t feel that Uncle Vernon’s temper should be tested this early in
the morning, especially when it was already under severe strain
from lack of food. He therefore settled for looking politely puzzled.
“This just arrived,” said Uncle Vernon. He brandished a piece of
purple writing paper at Harry. “A letter. About you.”
Harry’s confusion increased. Who would be writing to Uncle
Vernon about him? Who did he know who sent letters by the
postman?
Uncle Vernon glared at Harry, then looked down at the letter
and began to read aloud:


29



CHAPTER THREE
Dear Mr. and Mrs. Dursley,
We have never been introduced, but I am sure you have
heard a great deal from Harry about my son Ron.
As Harry might have told you, the final of the Quidditch
World Cup takes place this Monday night, and my husband,
Arthur, has just managed to get prime tickets through his connections at the Department of Magical Games and Sports.
I do hope you will allow us to take Harry to the match, as
this really is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity; Britain hasn’t
hosted the cup for thirty years, and tickets are extremely hard
to come by. We would of course be glad to have Harry stay for
the remainder of the summer holidays, and to see him safely
onto the train back to school.
It would be best for Harry to send us your answer as quickly
as possible in the normal way, because the Muggle postman has
never delivered to our house, and I am not sure he even knows
where it is.
Hoping to see Harry soon,
Yours sincerely,

P.S. I do hope we’ve put enough stamps on.
Uncle Vernon finished reading, put his hand back into his breast
pocket, and drew out something else.
“Look at this,” he growled.
He held up the envelope in which Mrs. Weasley’s letter had
come, and Harry had to fight down a laugh. Every bit of it was
covered in stamps except for a square inch on the front, into


30



THE INVITATION
which Mrs. Weasley had squeezed the Dursleys’ address in minute
writing.
“She did put enough stamps on, then,” said Harry, trying to
sound as though Mrs. Weasley’s was a mistake anyone could make.
His uncle’s eyes flashed.
“The postman noticed,” he said through gritted teeth. “Very interested to know where this letter came from, he was. That’s why he
rang the doorbell. Seemed to think it was funny.”
Harry didn’t say anything. Other people might not understand
why Uncle Vernon was making a fuss about too many stamps, but
Harry had lived with the Dursleys too long not to know how
touchy they were about anything even slightly out of the ordinary.
Their worst fear was that someone would find out that they were
connected (however distantly) with people like Mrs. Weasley.
Uncle Vernon was still glaring at Harry, who tried to keep his expression neutral. If he didn’t do or say anything stupid, he might
just be in for the treat of a lifetime. He waited for Uncle Vernon to
say something, but he merely continued to glare. Harry decided to
break the silence.
“So — can I go then?” he asked.
A slight spasm crossed Uncle Vernon’s large purple face. The
mustache bristled. Harry thought he knew what was going on behind the mustache: a furious battle as two of Uncle Vernon’s most
fundamental instincts came into conflict. Allowing Harry to go
would make Harry happy, something Uncle Vernon had struggled
against for thirteen years. On the other hand, allowing Harry to
disappear to the Weasleys’ for the rest of the summer would get rid
of him two weeks earlier than anyone could have hoped, and
Uncle Vernon hated having Harry in the house. To give himself


CHAPTER THREE
thinking time, it seemed, he looked down at Mrs. Weasley’s letter
again.
“Who is this woman?” he said, staring at the signature with
distaste.
“You’ve seen her,” said Harry. “She’s my friend Ron’s mother, she
was meeting him off the Hog — off the school train at the end of
last term.”
He had almost said “Hogwarts Express,” and that was a sure way
to get his uncle’s temper up. Nobody ever mentioned the name of
Harry’s school aloud in the Dursley household.
Uncle Vernon screwed up his enormous face as though trying to
remember something very unpleasant.
“Dumpy sort of woman?” he growled finally. “Load of children
with red hair?”
Harry frowned. He thought it was a bit rich of Uncle Vernon to
call anyone “dumpy,” when his own son, Dudley, had finally
achieved what he’d been threatening to do since the age of three,
and become wider than he was tall.
Uncle Vernon was perusing the letter again.
“Quidditch,” he muttered under his breath. “Quidditch — what
is this rubbish?”
Harry felt a second stab of annoyance.
“It’s a sport,” he said shortly. “Played on broom —”
“All right, all right!” said Uncle Vernon loudly. Harry saw, with
some satisfaction, that his uncle looked vaguely panicky. Apparently his nerves couldn’t stand the sound of the word “broomsticks” in his living room. He took refuge in perusing the letter
again. Harry saw his lips form the words “send us your answer . . .
in the normal way.” He scowled.


32



THE INVITATION
“What does she mean, ‘the normal way’?” he spat.
“Normal for us,” said Harry, and before his uncle could stop
him, he added, “you know, owl post. That’s what’s normal for
wizards.”
Uncle Vernon looked as outraged as if Harry had just uttered a
disgusting swear word. Shaking with anger, he shot a nervous look
through the window, as though expecting to see some of the neighbors with their ears pressed against the glass.
“How many times do I have to tell you not to mention that unnaturalness under my roof?” he hissed, his face now a rich plum
color. “You stand there, in the clothes Petunia and I have put on
your ungrateful back —”
“Only after Dudley finished with them,” said Harry coldly, and
indeed, he was dressed in a sweatshirt so large for him that he had
had to roll back the sleeves five times so as to be able to use his
hands, and which fell past the knees of his extremely baggy jeans.
“I will not be spoken to like that!” said Uncle Vernon, trembling
with rage.
But Harry wasn’t going to stand for this. Gone were the days
when he had been forced to take every single one of the Dursleys’
stupid rules. He wasn’t following Dudley’s diet, and he wasn’t going
to let Uncle Vernon stop him from going to the Quidditch World
Cup, not if he could help it. Harry took a deep, steadying breath
and then said, “Okay, I can’t see the World Cup. Can I go now,
then? Only I’ve got a letter to Sirius I want to finish. You know —
my godfather.”
He had done it. He had said the magic words. Now he watched
the purple recede blotchily from Uncle Vernon’s face, making it
look like badly mixed black currant ice cream.


33



CHAPTER THREE
“You’re — you’re writing to him, are you?” said Uncle Vernon,
in a would-be calm voice — but Harry had seen the pupils of his
tiny eyes contract with sudden fear.
“Well — yeah,” said Harry, casually. “It’s been a while since he
heard from me, and, you know, if he doesn’t, he might start thinking something’s wrong.”
He stopped there to enjoy the effect of these words. He could almost see the cogs working under Uncle Vernon’s thick, dark, neatly
parted hair. If he tried to stop Harry writing to Sirius, Sirius would
think Harry was being mistreated. If he told Harry he couldn’t go
to the Quidditch World Cup, Harry would write and tell Sirius,
who would know Harry was being mistreated. There was only one
thing for Uncle Vernon to do. Harry could see the conclusion
forming in his uncle’s mind as though the great mustached face
were transparent. Harry tried not to smile, to keep his own face as
blank as possible. And then —
“Well, all right then. You can go to this ruddy . . . this stupid . . .
this World Cup thing. You write and tell these — these Weasleys
they’re to pick you up, mind. I haven’t got time to go dropping you
off all over the country. And you can spend the rest of the summer
there. And you can tell your — your godfather . . . tell him . . . tell
him you’re going.”
“Okay then,” said Harry brightly.
He turned and walked toward the living room door, fighting the
urge to jump into the air and whoop. He was going . . . he was
going to the Weasleys’, he was going to watch the Quidditch World
Cup!
Outside in the hall he nearly ran into Dudley, who had been
lurking behind the door, clearly hoping to overhear Harry being


THE INVITATION
told off. He looked shocked to see the broad grin on Harry’s
face.
“That was an excellent breakfast, wasn’t it?” said Harry. “I feel
really full, don’t you?”
Laughing at the astonished look on Dudley’s face, Harry took
the stairs three at a time, and hurled himself back into his
bedroom.
The first thing he saw was that Hedwig was back. She was sitting
in her cage, staring at Harry with her enormous amber eyes, and
clicking her beak in the way that meant she was annoyed about
something. Exactly what was annoying her became apparent almost at once.
“OUCH!” said Harry as what appeared to be a small, gray,
feathery tennis ball collided with the side of his head. Harry massaged the spot furiously, looking up to see what had hit him, and
saw a minute owl, small enough to fit into the palm of his hand,
whizzing excitedly around the room like a loose firework. Harry
then realized that the owl had dropped a letter at his feet. Harry
bent down, recognized Ron’s handwriting, then tore open the envelope. Inside was a hastily scribbled note.
Harry — DAD GOT THE TICKETS — Ireland versus
Bulgaria, Monday night. Mum’s writing to the Muggles to ask
you to stay. They might already have the letter, I don’t know
how fast Muggle post is. Thought I’d send this with Pig
anyway.
Harry stared at the word “Pig,” then looked up at the tiny owl
now zooming around the light fixture on the ceiling. He had never


35



CHAPTER THREE
seen anything that looked less like a pig. Maybe he couldn’t read
Ron’s writing. He went back to the letter:
We’re coming for you whether the Muggles like it or not, you
can’t miss the World Cup, only Mum and Dad reckon it’s better
if we pretend to ask their permission first. If they say yes, send
Pig back with your answer pronto, and we’ll come and get you
at five o’clock on Sunday. If they say no, send Pig back pronto
and we’ll come and get you at five o’clock on Sunday anyway.
Hermione’s arriving this afternoon. Percy’s started work —
the Department of International Magical Cooperation. Don’t
mention anything about Abroad while you’re here unless you
want the pants bored off you.
See you soon —
“Calm down!” Harry said as the small owl flew low over his
head, twittering madly with what Harry could only assume was
pride at having delivered the letter to the right person. “Come here,
I need you to take my answer back!”
The owl fluttered down on top of Hedwig’s cage. Hedwig looked
coldly up at it, as though daring it to try and come any closer.
Harry seized his eagle-feather quill once more, grabbed a fresh
piece of parchment, and wrote:
Ron, it’s all okay, the Muggles say I can come. See you five

THE INVITATION
He folded this note up very small, and with immense difficulty,
tied it to the tiny owl’s leg as it hopped on the spot with excitement. The moment the note was secure, the owl was off again; it
zoomed out of the window and out of sight.
Harry turned to Hedwig.
“Feeling up to a long journey?” he asked her.
Hedwig hooted in a dignified sort of a way.
“Can you take this to Sirius for me?” he said, picking up his letter. “Hang on . . . I just want to finish it.”
He unfolded the parchment and hastily added a postscript.
If you want to contact me, I’ll be at my friend Ron Weasley’s for
the rest of the summer. His dad’s got us tickets for the Quidditch World Cup!
The letter finished, he tied it to Hedwig’s leg; she kept unusually
still, as though determined to show him how a real post owl should
behave.
“I’ll be at Ron’s when you get back, all right?” Harry told her.
She nipped his finger affectionately, then, with a soft swooshing
noise, spread her enormous wings and soared out of the open
window.
Harry watched her out of sight, then crawled under his bed,
wrenched up the loose floorboard, and pulled out a large chunk of
birthday cake. He sat there on the floor eating it, savoring the happiness that was flooding through him. He had cake, and Dudley
had nothing but grapefruit; it was a bright summer’s day, he would

be leaving Privet Drive tomorrow, his scar felt perfectly normal
again, and he was going to watch the Quidditch World Cup. It was
hard, just now, to feel worried about anything — even Lord
Voldemort.

BACK TO THE BURROW

B

y twelve o’clock the next day, Harry’s school trunk was packed
with his school things and all his most prized possessions —
the Invisibility Cloak he had inherited from his father, the broomstick he had gotten from Sirius, the enchanted map of Hogwarts he
had been given by Fred and George Weasley last year. He had emptied his hiding place under the loose floorboard of all food, doublechecked every nook and cranny of his bedroom for forgotten
spellbooks or quills, and taken down the chart on the wall counting down the days to September the first, on which he liked to
cross off the days remaining until his return to Hogwarts.
The atmosphere inside number four, Privet Drive was extremely
tense. The imminent arrival at their house of an assortment of wizards was making the Dursleys uptight and irritable. Uncle Vernon
had looked downright alarmed when Harry informed him that the
Weasleys would be arriving at five o’clock the very next day.
“I hope you told them to dress properly, these people,” he


39



CHAPTER FOUR
snarled at once. “I’ve seen the sort of stuff your lot wear. They’d
better have the decency to put on normal clothes, that’s all.”
Harry felt a slight sense of foreboding. He had rarely seen Mr. or
Mrs. Weasley wearing anything that the Dursleys would call “normal.” Their children might don Muggle clothing during the holidays, but Mr. and Mrs. Weasley usually wore long robes in varying
states of shabbiness. Harry wasn’t bothered about what the neighbors would think, but he was anxious about how rude the Dursleys
might be to the Weasleys if they turned up looking like their worst
idea of wizards.
Uncle Vernon had put on his best suit. To some people, this
might have looked like a gesture of welcome, but Harry knew it
was because Uncle Vernon wanted to look impressive and intimidating. Dudley, on the other hand, looked somehow diminished.
This was not because the diet was at last taking effect, but due to
fright. Dudley had emerged from his last encounter with a fullygrown wizard with a curly pig’s tail poking out of the seat of his
trousers, and Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon had had to pay for its
removal at a private hospital in London. It wasn’t altogether surprising, therefore, that Dudley kept running his hand nervously
over his backside, and walking sideways from room to room, so as
not to present the same target to the enemy.
Lunch was an almost silent meal. Dudley didn’t even protest at
the food (cottage cheese and grated celery). Aunt Petunia wasn’t
eating anything at all. Her arms were folded, her lips were pursed,
and she seemed to be chewing her tongue, as though biting back
the furious diatribe she longed to throw at Harry.
“They’ll be driving, of course?” Uncle Vernon barked across the
table.


40



BACK TO THE BURROW
“Er,” said Harry.
He hadn’t thought of that. How were the Weasleys going to pick
him up? They didn’t have a car anymore; the old Ford Anglia they
had once owned was currently running wild in the Forbidden Forest at Hogwarts. But Mr. Weasley had borrowed a Ministry of
Magic car last year; possibly he would do the same today?
“I think so,” said Harry.
Uncle Vernon snorted into his mustache. Normally, Uncle Vernon would have asked what car Mr. Weasley drove; he tended to
judge other men by how big and expensive their cars were. But
Harry doubted whether Uncle Vernon would have taken to Mr.
Weasley even if he drove a Ferrari.
Harry spent most of the afternoon in his bedroom; he couldn’t
stand watching Aunt Petunia peer out through the net curtains
every few seconds, as though there had been a warning about an escaped rhinoceros. Finally, at a quarter to five, Harry went back
downstairs and into the living room.
Aunt Petunia was compulsively straightening cushions. Uncle
Vernon was pretending to read the paper, but his tiny eyes were not
moving, and Harry was sure he was really listening with all his
might for the sound of an approaching car. Dudley was crammed
into an armchair, his porky hands beneath him, clamped firmly
around his bottom. Harry couldn’t take the tension; he left the
room and went and sat on the stairs in the hall, his eyes on his
watch and his heart pumping fast from excitement and nerves.
But five o’clock came and then went. Uncle Vernon, perspiring
slightly in his suit, opened the front door, peered up and down the
street, then withdrew his head quickly.
“They’re late!” he snarled at Harry.


41



CHAPTER FOUR
“I know,” said Harry. “Maybe — er — the traffic’s bad, or
something.”
Ten past five . . . then a quarter past five . . . Harry was starting
to feel anxious himself now. At half past, he heard Uncle Vernon
and Aunt Petunia conversing in terse mutters in the living room.
“No consideration at all.”
“We might’ve had an engagement.”
“Maybe they think they’ll get invited to dinner if they’re late.”
“Well, they most certainly won’t be,” said Uncle Vernon, and
Harry heard him stand up and start pacing the living room.
“They’ll take the boy and go, there’ll be no hanging around. That’s
if they’re coming at all. Probably mistaken the day. I daresay their
kind don’t set much store by punctuality. Either that or they drive
some tin-pot car that’s broken d — AAAAAAAARRRRRGH!”
Harry jumped up. From the other side of the living room door
came the sounds of the three Dursleys scrambling, panic-stricken,
across the room. Next moment Dudley came flying into the hall,
looking terrified.
“What happened?” said Harry. “What’s the matter?”
But Dudley didn’t seem able to speak. Hands still clamped over
his buttocks, he waddled as fast as he could into the kitchen. Harry
hurried into the living room.
Loud hangings and scrapings were coming from behind the
Dursleys’ boarded-up fireplace, which had a fake coal fire plugged
in front of it.
“What is it?” gasped Aunt Petunia, who had backed into the wall
and was staring, terrified, toward the fire. “What is it, Vernon?”
But they were left in doubt barely a second longer. Voices could
be heard from inside the blocked fireplace.


42



BACK TO THE BURROW
“Ouch! Fred, no — go back, go back, there’s been some kind of
mistake — tell George not to — OUCH! George, no, there’s no
room, go back quickly and tell Ron —”
“Maybe Harry can hear us, Dad — maybe he’ll be able to let us
out —”
There was a loud hammering of fists on the boards behind the
electric fire.
“Harry? Harry, can you hear us?”
The Dursleys rounded on Harry like a pair of angry wolverines.
“What is this?” growled Uncle Vernon. “What’s going on?”
“They — they’ve tried to get here by Floo powder,” said Harry,
fighting a mad desire to laugh. “They can travel by fire — only
you’ve blocked the fireplace — hang on —”
He approached the fireplace and called through the boards.
“Mr. Weasley? Can you hear me?”
The hammering stopped. Somebody inside the chimney piece
said, “Shh!”
“Mr. Weasley, it’s Harry . . . the fireplace has been blocked up.
You won’t be able to get through there.”
“Damn!” said Mr. Weasley’s voice. “What on earth did they
want to block up the fireplace for?”
“They’ve got an electric fire,” Harry explained.
“Really?” said Mr. Weasley’s voice excitedly. “Eclectic, you say?
With a plug? Gracious, I must see that. . . . Let’s think . . . ouch,
Ron!”
Ron’s voice now joined the others’.
“What are we doing here? Has something gone wrong?”
“Oh no, Ron,” came Fred’s voice, very sarcastically. “No, this is
exactly where we wanted to end up.”


43



CHAPTER FOUR
“Yeah, we’re having the time of our lives here,” said George,
whose voice sounded muffled, as though he was squashed against
the wall.
“Boys, boys . . .” said Mr. Weasley vaguely. “I’m trying to think
what to do. . . . Yes . . . only way . . . Stand back, Harry.”
Harry retreated to the sofa. Uncle Vernon, however, moved
forward.
“Wait a moment!” he bellowed at the fire. “What exactly are you
going to —”
BANG.
The electric fire shot across the room as the boarded-up fireplace
burst outward, expelling Mr. Weasley, Fred, George, and Ron in a
cloud of rubble and loose chippings. Aunt Petunia shrieked and fell
backward over the coffee table; Uncle Vernon caught her before she
hit the floor, and gaped, speechless, at the Weasleys, all of whom
had bright red hair, including Fred and George, who were identical
to the last freckle.
“That’s better,” panted Mr. Weasley, brushing dust from his long
green robes and straightening his glasses. “Ah — you must be
Harry’s aunt and uncle!”
Tall, thin, and balding, he moved toward Uncle Vernon, his
hand outstretched, but Uncle Vernon backed away several paces,
dragging Aunt Petunia. Words utterly failed Uncle Vernon. His
best suit was covered in white dust, which had settled in his hair
and mustache and made him look as though he had just aged thirty
years.
“Er — yes — sorry about that,” said Mr. Weasley, lowering his
hand and looking over his shoulder at the blasted fireplace. “It’s all


44



BACK TO THE BURROW
my fault. It just didn’t occur to me that we wouldn’t be able to get
out at the other end. I had your fireplace connected to the Floo
Network, you see — just for an afternoon, you know, so we could
get Harry. Muggle fireplaces aren’t supposed to be connected,
strictly speaking — but I’ve got a useful contact at the Floo Regulation Panel and he fixed it for me. I can put it right in a jiffy,
though, don’t worry. I’ll light a fire to send the boys back, and then
I can repair your fireplace before I Disapparate.”
Harry was ready to bet that the Dursleys hadn’t understood a
single word of this. They were still gaping at Mr. Weasley, thunderstruck. Aunt Petunia staggered upright again and hid behind
Uncle Vernon.
“Hello, Harry!” said Mr. Weasley brightly. “Got your trunk
ready?”
“It’s upstairs,” said Harry, grinning back.
“We’ll get it,” said Fred at once. Winking at Harry, he and
George left the room. They knew where Harry’s bedroom was, having once rescued him from it in the dead of night. Harry suspected
that Fred and George were hoping for a glimpse of Dudley; they
had heard a lot about him from Harry.
“Well,” said Mr. Weasley, swinging his arms slightly, while he
tried to find words to break the very nasty silence. “Very — erm —
very nice place you’ve got here.”
As the usually spotless living room was now covered in dust and
bits of brick, this remark didn’t go down too well with the Dursleys. Uncle Vernon’s face purpled once more, and Aunt Petunia
started chewing her tongue again. However, they seemed too
scared to actually say anything.


45



CHAPTER FOUR
Mr. Weasley was looking around. He loved everything to do
with Muggles. Harry could see him itching to go and examine the
television and the video recorder.
“They run off eckeltricity, do they?” he said knowledgeably. “Ah
yes, I can see the plugs. I collect plugs,” he added to Uncle Vernon.
“And batteries. Got a very large collection of batteries. My wife
thinks I’m mad, but there you are.”
Uncle Vernon clearly thought Mr. Weasley was mad too. He
moved ever so slightly to the right, screening Aunt Petunia from
view, as though he thought Mr. Weasley might suddenly run at
them and attack.
Dudley suddenly reappeared in the room. Harry could hear the
clunk of his trunk on the stairs, and knew that the sounds had
scared Dudley out of the kitchen. Dudley edged along the wall,
gazing at Mr. Weasley with terrified eyes, and attempted to conceal
himself behind his mother and father. Unfortunately, Uncle Vernon’s bulk, while sufficient to hide bony Aunt Petunia, was
nowhere near enough to conceal Dudley.
“Ah, this is your cousin, is it, Harry?” said Mr. Weasley, taking
another brave stab at making conversation.
“Yep,” said Harry, “that’s Dudley.”
He and Ron exchanged glances and then quickly looked away
from each other; the temptation to burst out laughing was almost
overwhelming. Dudley was still clutching his bottom as though
afraid it might fall off. Mr. Weasley, however, seemed genuinely
concerned at Dudley’s peculiar behavior. Indeed, from the tone of
his voice when he next spoke, Harry was quite sure that Mr.
Weasley thought Dudley was quite as mad as the Dursleys thought
he was, except that Mr. Weasley felt sympathy rather than fear.


46



BACK TO THE BURROW
“Having a good holiday, Dudley?” he said kindly.
Dudley whimpered. Harry saw his hands tighten still harder
over his massive backside.
Fred and George came back into the room carrying Harry’s
school trunk. They glanced around as they entered and spotted
Dudley. Their faces cracked into identical evil grins.
“Ah, right,” said Mr. Weasley. “Better get cracking then.”
He pushed up the sleeves of his robes and took out his wand.
Harry saw the Dursleys draw back against the wall as one.
“Incendio!” said Mr. Weasley, pointing his wand at the hole in
the wall behind him.
Flames rose at once in the fireplace, crackling merrily as though
they had been burning for hours. Mr. Weasley took a small drawstring bag from his pocket, untied it, took a pinch of the powder
inside, and threw it onto the flames, which turned emerald green
and roared higher than ever.
“Off you go then, Fred,” said Mr. Weasley.
“Coming,” said Fred. “Oh no — hang on —”
A bag of sweets had spilled out of Fred’s pocket and the contents
were now rolling in every direction — big, fat toffees in brightly
colored wrappers.
Fred scrambled around, cramming them back into his pocket,
then gave the Dursleys a cheery wave, stepped forward, and walked
right into the fire, saying “the Burrow!” Aunt Petunia gave a little
shuddering gasp. There was a whooshing sound, and Fred
vanished.
“Right then, George,” said Mr. Weasley, “you and the trunk.”
Harry helped George carry the trunk forward into the flames
and turn it onto its end so that he could hold it better. Then, with


47



CHAPTER FOUR
a second whoosh, George had cried “the Burrow!” and vanished
too.
“Ron, you next,” said Mr. Weasley.
“See you,” said Ron brightly to the Dursleys. He grinned
broadly at Harry, then stepped into the fire, shouted “the Burrow!”
and disappeared.
Now Harry and Mr. Weasley alone remained.
“Well . . . ’bye then,” Harry said to the Dursleys.
They didn’t say anything at all. Harry moved toward the fire, but
just as he reached the edge of the hearth, Mr. Weasley put out a
hand and held him back. He was looking at the Dursleys in
amazement.
“Harry said good-bye to you,” he said. “Didn’t you hear him?”
“It doesn’t matter,” Harry muttered to Mr. Weasley. “Honestly, I
don’t care.”
Mr. Weasley did not remove his hand from Harry’s shoulder.
“You aren’t going to see your nephew till next summer,” he said
to Uncle Vernon in mild indignation. “Surely you’re going to say
good-bye?”
Uncle Vernon’s face worked furiously. The idea of being taught
consideration by a man who had just blasted away half his living
room wall seemed to be causing him intense suffering. But Mr.
Weasley’s wand was still in his hand, and Uncle Vernon’s tiny eyes
darted to it once, before he said, very resentfully, “Good-bye, then.”
“See you,” said Harry, putting one foot forward into the green
flames, which felt pleasantly like warm breath. At that moment,
however, a horrible gagging sound erupted behind him, and Aunt
Petunia started to scream.
Harry wheeled around. Dudley was no longer standing behind


48



BACK TO THE BURROW
his parents. He was kneeling beside the coffee table, and he was
gagging and sputtering on a foot-long, purple, slimy thing that was
protruding from his mouth. One bewildered second later, Harry
realized that the foot-long thing was Dudley’s tongue — and that a
brightly colored toffee wrapper lay on the floor before him.
Aunt Petunia hurled herself onto the ground beside Dudley,
seized the end of his swollen tongue, and attempted to wrench it
out of his mouth; unsurprisingly, Dudley yelled and sputtered
worse than ever, trying to fight her off. Uncle Vernon was bellowing and waving his arms around, and Mr. Weasley had to shout to
make himself heard.
“Not to worry, I can sort him out!” he yelled, advancing on
Dudley with his wand outstretched, but Aunt Petunia screamed
worse than ever and threw herself on top of Dudley, shielding him
from Mr. Weasley.
“No, really!” said Mr. Weasley desperately. “It’s a simple process —
it was the toffee — my son Fred — real practical joker — but it’s
only an Engorgement Charm — at least, I think it is — please, I can
correct it —”
But far from being reassured, the Dursleys became more panicstricken; Aunt Petunia was sobbing hysterically, tugging Dudley’s
tongue as though determined to rip it out; Dudley appeared to be
suffocating under the combined pressure of his mother and his
tongue; and Uncle Vernon, who had lost control completely, seized
a china figure from on top of the sideboard and threw it very hard
at Mr. Weasley, who ducked, causing the ornament to shatter in
the blasted fireplace.
“Now really!” said Mr. Weasley angrily, brandishing his wand.
“I’m trying to help!”


49

CHAPTER FOUR
Bellowing like a wounded hippo, Uncle Vernon snatched up another ornament.
“Harry, go! Just go!” Mr. Weasley shouted, his wand on Uncle
Vernon. “I’ll sort this out!”
Harry didn’t want to miss the fun, but Uncle Vernon’s second ornament narrowly missed his left ear, and on balance he thought it
best to leave the situation to Mr. Weasley. He stepped into the fire,
looking over his shoulder as he said “the Burrow!” His last fleeting
glimpse of the living room was of Mr. Weasley blasting a third ornament out of Uncle Vernon’s hand with his wand, Aunt Petunia
screaming and lying on top of Dudley, and Dudley’s tongue lolling
around like a great slimy python. But next moment Harry had begun to spin very fast, and the Dursleys’ living room was whipped
out of sight in a rush of emerald-green flames.

arry spun faster and faster, elbows tucked tightly to his
sides, blurred fireplaces flashing past him, until he started
to feel sick and closed his eyes. Then, when at last he felt himself
slowing down, he threw out his hands and came to a halt in time to
prevent himself from falling face forward out of the Weasleys’
kitchen fire.
“Did he eat it?” said Fred excitedly, holding out a hand to pull
Harry to his feet.
“Yeah,” said Harry, straightening up. “What was it?”
“Ton-Tongue Toffee,” said Fred brightly. “George and I invented them, and we’ve been looking for someone to test them on
all summer. . . .”
The tiny kitchen exploded with laughter; Harry looked around
and saw that Ron and George were sitting at the scrubbed wooden
table with two red-haired people Harry had never seen before,


51



CHAPTER FIVE
though he knew immediately who they must be: Bill and Charlie,
the two eldest Weasley brothers.
“How’re you doing, Harry?” said the nearer of the two, grinning
at him and holding out a large hand, which Harry shook, feeling
calluses and blisters under his fingers. This had to be Charlie, who
worked with dragons in Romania. Charlie was built like the twins,
shorter and stockier than Percy and Ron, who were both long and
lanky. He had a broad, good-natured face, which was weatherbeaten and so freckly that he looked almost tanned; his arms were
muscular, and one of them had a large, shiny burn on it.
Bill got to his feet, smiling, and also shook Harry’s hand. Bill
came as something of a surprise. Harry knew that he worked for
the wizarding bank, Gringotts, and that Bill had been Head Boy at
Hogwarts; Harry had always imagined Bill to be an older version of
Percy: fussy about rule-breaking and fond of bossing everyone
around. However, Bill was — there was no other word for it —
cool. He was tall, with long hair that he had tied back in a ponytail.
He was wearing an earring with what looked like a fang dangling
from it. Bill’s clothes would not have looked out of place at a rock
concert, except that Harry recognized his boots to be made, not of
leather, but of dragon hide.
Before any of them could say anything else, there was a faint
popping noise, and Mr. Weasley appeared out of thin air at
George’s shoulder. He was looking angrier than Harry had ever
seen him.
“That wasn’t funny, Fred!” he shouted. “What on earth did you
give that Muggle boy?”
“I didn’t give him anything,” said Fred, with another evil grin. “I


52

WEASLEYS’ WIZARD
WHEEZES
just dropped it. . . . It was his fault he went and ate it, I never told
him to.”
“You dropped it on purpose!” roared Mr. Weasley. “You knew
he’d eat it, you knew he was on a diet —”
“How big did his tongue get?” George asked eagerly.
“It was four feet long before his parents would let me shrink it!”
Harry and the Weasleys roared with laughter again.
“It isn’t funny!” Mr. Weasley shouted. “That sort of behavior seriously undermines wizard–Muggle relations! I spend half my life
campaigning against the mistreatment of Muggles, and my own
sons —”
“We didn’t give it to him because he’s a Muggle!” said Fred
indignantly.
“No, we gave it to him because he’s a great bullying git,” said
George. “Isn’t he, Harry?”
“Yeah, he is, Mr. Weasley,” said Harry earnestly.
“That’s not the point!” raged Mr. Weasley. “You wait until I tell
your mother —”
“Tell me what?” said a voice behind them.
Mrs. Weasley had just entered the kitchen. She was a short,
plump woman with a very kind face, though her eyes were
presently narrowed with suspicion.
“Oh hello, Harry, dear,” she said, spotting him and smiling.
Then her eyes snapped back to her husband. “Tell me what,
Arthur?”
Mr. Weasley hesitated. Harry could tell that, however angry he
was with Fred and George, he hadn’t really intended to tell Mrs.
Weasley what had happened. There was a silence, while Mr.


53



CHAPTER FIVE
Weasley eyed his wife nervously. Then two girls appeared in the
kitchen doorway behind Mrs. Weasley. One, with very bushy
brown hair and rather large front teeth, was Harry’s and Ron’s
friend, Hermione Granger. The other, who was small and redhaired, was Ron’s younger sister, Ginny. Both of them smiled at
Harry, who grinned back, which made Ginny go scarlet — she had
been very taken with Harry ever since his first visit to the Burrow.
“Tell me what, Arthur?” Mrs. Weasley repeated, in a dangerous
sort of voice.
“It’s nothing, Molly,” mumbled Mr. Weasley, “Fred and George
just — but I’ve had words with them —”
“What have they done this time?” said Mrs. Weasley. “If it’s got
anything to do with Weasleys’ Wizard Wheezes —”
“Why don’t you show Harry where he’s sleeping, Ron?” said
Hermione from the doorway.
“He knows where he’s sleeping,” said Ron, “in my room, he slept
there last —”
“We can all go,” said Hermione pointedly.
“Oh,” said Ron, cottoning on. “Right.”
“Yeah, we’ll come too,” said George.
“You stay where you are!” snarled Mrs. Weasley.
Harry and Ron edged out of the kitchen, and they, Hermione,
and Ginny set off along the narrow hallway and up the rickety
staircase that zigzagged through the house to the upper stories.
“What are Weasleys’ Wizard Wheezes?” Harry asked as they
climbed.
Ron and Ginny both laughed, although Hermione didn’t.
“Mum found this stack of order forms when she was cleaning


54

WEASLEYS’ WIZARD
WHEEZES
Fred and George’s room,” said Ron quietly. “Great long price lists
for stuff they’ve invented. Joke stuff, you know. Fake wands and
trick sweets, loads of stuff. It was brilliant, I never knew they’d been
inventing all that . . .”
“We’ve been hearing explosions out of their room for ages, but
we never thought they were actually making things,” said Ginny.
“We thought they just liked the noise.”
“Only, most of the stuff — well, all of it, really — was a bit dangerous,” said Ron, “and, you know, they were planning to sell it at
Hogwarts to make some money, and Mum went mad at them. Told
them they weren’t allowed to make any more of it, and burned all
the order forms. . . . She’s furious at them anyway. They didn’t get
as many O.W.L.s as she expected.”
O.W.L.s were Ordinary Wizarding Levels, the examinations
Hogwarts students took at the age of fifteen.
“And then there was this big row,” Ginny said, “because Mum
wants them to go into the Ministry of Magic like Dad, and they
told her all they want to do is open a joke shop.”
Just then a door on the second landing opened, and a face poked
out wearing horn-rimmed glasses and a very annoyed expression.
“Hi, Percy,” said Harry.
“Oh hello, Harry,” said Percy. “I was wondering who was making
all the noise. I’m trying to work in here, you know — I’ve got a
report to finish for the office — and it’s rather difficult to concentrate when people keep thundering up and down the stairs.”
“We’re not thundering,” said Ron irritably. “We’re walking. Sorry
if we’ve disturbed the top-secret workings of the Ministry of Magic.”
“What are you working on?” said Harry.


55

CHAPTER FIVE
“A report for the Department of International Magical Cooperation,” said Percy smugly. “We’re trying to standardize cauldron
thickness. Some of these foreign imports are just a shade too
thin — leakages have been increasing at a rate of almost three percent a year —”
“That’ll change the world, that report will,” said Ron. “Front
page of the Daily Prophet, I expect, cauldron leaks.”
Percy went slightly pink.
“You might sneer, Ron,” he said heatedly, “but unless some sort
of international law is imposed we might well find the market
flooded with flimsy, shallow-bottomed products that seriously
endanger —”
“Yeah, yeah, all right,” said Ron, and he started off upstairs
again. Percy slammed his bedroom door shut. As Harry, Hermione, and Ginny followed Ron up three more flights of stairs, shouts
from the kitchen below echoed up to them. It sounded as though
Mr. Weasley had told Mrs. Weasley about the toffees.
The room at the top of the house where Ron slept looked much
as it had the last time that Harry had come to stay: the same posters
of Ron’s favorite Quidditch team, the Chudley Cannons, were
whirling and waving on the walls and sloping ceiling, and the fish
tank on the windowsill, which had previously held frog spawn,
now contained one extremely large frog. Ron’s old rat, Scabbers,
was here no more, but instead there was the tiny gray owl that had
delivered Ron’s letter to Harry in Privet Drive. It was hopping up
and down in a small cage and twittering madly.
“Shut up, Pig,” said Ron, edging his way between two of the
four beds that had been squeezed into the room. “Fred and George
are in here with us, because Bill and Charlie are in their room,” he


56



WEASLEYS’ WIZARD
WHEEZES
told Harry. “Percy gets to keep his room all to himself because he’s
got to work.”
“Er — why are you calling that owl Pig?” Harry asked Ron.
“Because he’s being stupid,” said Ginny. “Its proper name is
Pigwidgeon.”
“Yeah, and that’s not a stupid name at all,” said Ron sarcastically.
“Ginny named him,” he explained to Harry. “She reckons it’s
sweet. And I tried to change it, but it was too late, he won’t answer
to anything else. So now he’s Pig. I’ve got to keep him up here because he annoys Errol and Hermes. He annoys me too, come to
that.”
Pigwidgeon zoomed happily around his cage, hooting shrilly.
Harry knew Ron too well to take him seriously. He had moaned
continually about his old rat, Scabbers, but had been most upset
when Hermione’s cat, Crookshanks, appeared to have eaten him.
“Where’s Crookshanks?” Harry asked Hermione now.
“Out in the garden, I expect,” she said. “He likes chasing
gnomes. He’s never seen any before.”
“Percy’s enjoying work, then?” said Harry, sitting down on one
of the beds and watching the Chudley Cannons zooming in and
out of the posters on the ceiling.
“Enjoying it?” said Ron darkly. “I don’t reckon he’d come home
if Dad didn’t make him. He’s obsessed. Just don’t get him onto the
subject of his boss. According to Mr. Crouch . . . as I was saying to Mr.
Crouch . . . Mr. Crouch is of the opinion . . . Mr. Crouch was telling
me . . . They’ll be announcing their engagement any day now.”
“Have you had a good summer, Harry?” said Hermione. “Did
you get our food parcels and everything?”
“Yeah, thanks a lot,” said Harry. “They saved my life, those cakes.”

“And have you heard from — ?” Ron began, but at a look from
Hermione he fell silent. Harry knew Ron had been about to ask
about Sirius. Ron and Hermione had been so deeply involved in
helping Sirius escape from the Ministry of Magic that they were
almost as concerned about Harry’s godfather as he was. However,
discussing him in front of Ginny was a bad idea. Nobody but
themselves and Professor Dumbledore knew about how Sirius had
escaped, or believed in his innocence.
“I think they’ve stopped arguing,” said Hermione, to cover the
awkward moment, because Ginny was looking curiously from Ron
to Harry. “Shall we go down and help your mum with dinner?”
“Yeah, all right,” said Ron. The four of them left Ron’s room and
went back downstairs to find Mrs. Weasley alone in the kitchen,
looking extremely bad-tempered.
“We’re eating out in the garden,” she said when they came in.
“There’s just not room for eleven people in here. Could you take
the plates outside, girls? Bill and Charlie are setting up the tables.
Knives and forks, please, you two,” she said to Ron and Harry,
pointing her wand a little more vigorously than she had intended
at a pile of potatoes in the sink, which shot out of their skins so fast
that they ricocheted off the walls and ceiling.
“Oh for heaven’s sake,” she snapped, now directing her wand at
a dustpan, which hopped off the sideboard and started skating
across the floor, scooping up the potatoes. “Those two!” she burst
out savagely, now pulling pots and pans out of a cupboard, and
Harry knew she meant Fred and George. “I don’t know what’s going to happen to them, I really don’t. No ambition, unless you
count making as much trouble as they possibly can. . . .”
Mrs. Weasley slammed a large copper saucepan down on the


58



WEASLEYS’ WIZARD
WHEEZES
kitchen table and began to wave her wand around inside it. A
creamy sauce poured from the wand tip as she stirred.
“It’s not as though they haven’t got brains,” she continued irritably, taking the saucepan over to the stove and lighting it with a further poke of her wand, “but they’re wasting them, and unless they
pull themselves together soon, they’ll be in real trouble. I’ve had
more owls from Hogwarts about them than the rest put together. If
they carry on the way they’re going, they’ll end up in front of the
Improper Use of Magic Office.”
Mrs. Weasley jabbed her wand at the cutlery drawer, which shot
open. Harry and Ron both jumped out of the way as several knives
soared out of it, flew across the kitchen, and began chopping the
potatoes, which had just been tipped back into the sink by the
dustpan.
“I don’t know where we went wrong with them,” said Mrs.
Weasley, putting down her wand and starting to pull out still more
saucepans. “It’s been the same for years, one thing after another, and
they won’t listen to — OH NOT AGAIN !”
She had picked up her wand from the table, and it had emitted a
loud squeak and turned into a giant rubber mouse.
“One of their fake wands again!” she shouted. “How many times
have I told them not to leave them lying around?”
She grabbed her real wand and turned around to find that the
sauce on the stove was smoking.
“C’mon,” Ron said hurriedly to Harry, seizing a handful of cutlery from the open drawer, “let’s go and help Bill and Charlie.”
They left Mrs. Weasley and headed out the back door into
the yard.
They had only gone a few paces when Hermione’s bandy-legged


CHAPTER FIVE
ginger cat, Crookshanks, came pelting out of the garden, bottlebrush tail held high in the air, chasing what looked like a muddy
potato on legs. Harry recognized it instantly as a gnome. Barely ten
inches high, its horny little feet pattered very fast as it sprinted
across the yard and dived headlong into one of the Wellington
boots that lay scattered around the door. Harry could hear the
gnome giggling madly as Crookshanks inserted a paw into the
boot, trying to reach it. Meanwhile, a very loud crashing noise was
coming from the other side of the house. The source of the commotion was revealed as they entered the garden, and saw that Bill
and Charlie both had their wands out, and were making two battered old tables fly high above the lawn, smashing into each other,
each attempting to knock the other’s out of the air. Fred and
George were cheering, Ginny was laughing, and Hermione was
hovering near the hedge, apparently torn between amusement and
anxiety.
Bill’s table caught Charlie’s with a huge bang and knocked one
of its legs off. There was a clatter from overhead, and they all
looked up to see Percy’s head poking out of a window on the second floor.
“Will you keep it down?!” he bellowed.
“Sorry, Perce,” said Bill, grinning. “How’re the cauldron bottoms coming on?”
“Very badly,” said Percy peevishly, and he slammed the window
shut. Chuckling, Bill and Charlie directed the tables safely onto the
grass, end to end, and then, with a flick of his wand, Bill reattached
the table leg and conjured tablecloths from nowhere.
By seven o’clock, the two tables were groaning under dishes and
dishes of Mrs. Weasley’s excellent cooking, and the nine Weasleys,


Harry, and Hermione were settling themselves down to eat beneath
a clear, deep-blue sky. To somebody who had been living on meals
of increasingly stale cake all summer, this was paradise, and at first,
Harry listened rather than talked as he helped himself to chicken
and ham pie, boiled potatoes, and salad.
At the far end of the table, Percy was telling his father all about
his report on cauldron bottoms.
“I’ve told Mr. Crouch that I’ll have it ready by Tuesday,” Percy
was saying pompously. “That’s a bit sooner than he expected it, but
I like to keep on top of things. I think he’ll be grateful I’ve done it
in good time, I mean, it’s extremely busy in our department just
now, what with all the arrangements for the World Cup. We’re just
not getting the support we need from the Department of Magical
Games and Sports. Ludo Bagman —”
“I like Ludo,” said Mr. Weasley mildly. “He was the one who got
us such good tickets for the Cup. I did him a bit of a favor: His
brother, Otto, got into a spot of trouble — a lawnmower with unnatural powers — I smoothed the whole thing over.”
“Oh Bagman’s likable enough, of course,” said Percy dismissively, “but how he ever got to be Head of Department . . . when I
compare him to Mr. Crouch! I can’t see Mr. Crouch losing a member of our department and not trying to find out what’s happened
to them. You realize Bertha Jorkins has been missing for over a
month now? Went on holiday to Albania and never came back?”
“Yes, I was asking Ludo about that,” said Mr. Weasley, frowning.
“He says Bertha’s gotten lost plenty of times before now — though
I must say, if it was someone in my department, I’d be worried. . . .”
“Oh Bertha’s hopeless, all right,” said Percy. “I hear she’s been
shunted from department to department for years, much more


CHAPTER FIVE
trouble than she’s worth . . . but all the same, Bagman ought to be
trying to find her. Mr. Crouch has been taking a personal interest,
she worked in our department at one time, you know, and I think
Mr. Crouch was quite fond of her — but Bagman just keeps laughing and saying she probably misread the map and ended up in Australia instead of Albania. However” — Percy heaved an impressive
sigh and took a deep swig of elderflower wine — “we’ve got quite
enough on our plates at the Department of International Magical
Cooperation without trying to find members of other departments
too. As you know, we’ve got another big event to organize right after the World Cup.”
Percy cleared his throat significantly and looked down toward
the end of the table where Harry, Ron, and Hermione were sitting.
“You know the one I’m talking about, Father.” He raised his voice
slightly. “The top-secret one.”
Ron rolled his eyes and muttered to Harry and Hermione, “He’s
been trying to get us to ask what that event is ever since he started
work. Probably an exhibition of thick-bottomed cauldrons.”
In the middle of the table, Mrs. Weasley was arguing with Bill
about his earring, which seemed to be a recent acquisition.
“. . . with a horrible great fang on it. Really, Bill, what do they
say at the bank?”
“Mum, no one at the bank gives a damn how I dress as long as I
bring home plenty of treasure,” said Bill patiently.
“And your hair’s getting silly, dear,” said Mrs. Weasley, fingering
her wand lovingly. “I wish you’d let me give it a trim. . . .”
“I like it,” said Ginny, who was sitting beside Bill. “You’re so oldfashioned, Mum. Anyway, it’s nowhere near as long as Professor
Dumbledore’s. . . .”


WEASLEYS’ WIZARD
WHEEZES
Next to Mrs. Weasley, Fred, George, and Charlie were all talking
spiritedly about the World Cup.
“It’s got to be Ireland,” said Charlie thickly, through a mouthful
of potato. “They flattened Peru in the semifinals.”
“Bulgaria has got Viktor Krum, though,” said Fred.
“Krum’s one decent player, Ireland has got seven,” said Charlie
shortly. “I wish England had got through. That was embarrassing,
that was.”
“What happened?” said Harry eagerly, regretting more than ever
his isolation from the wizarding world when he was stuck on Privet
Drive.
“Went down to Transylvania, three hundred and ninety to ten,”
said Charlie gloomily. “Shocking performance. And Wales lost to
Uganda, and Scotland was slaughtered by Luxembourg.”
Harry had been on the Gryffindor House Quidditch team ever
since his first year at Hogwarts and owned one of the best racing
brooms in the world, a Firebolt. Flying came more naturally to
Harry than anything else in the magical world, and he played in
the position of Seeker on the Gryffindor House team.
Mr. Weasley conjured up candles to light the darkening garden
before they had their homemade strawberry ice cream, and by the
time they had finished, moths were fluttering low over the table,
and the warm air was perfumed with the smells of grass and honeysuckle. Harry was feeling extremely well fed and at peace with
the world as he watched several gnomes sprinting through the rosebushes, laughing madly and closely pursued by Crookshanks.
Ron looked carefully up the table to check that the rest of the
family were all busy talking, then he said very quietly to Harry,
“So — have you heard from Sirius lately?”


63



CHAPTER FIVE
Hermione looked around, listening closely.
“Yeah,” said Harry softly, “twice. He sounds okay. I wrote to him
yesterday. He might write back while I’m here.”
He suddenly remembered the reason he had written to Sirius,
and for a moment was on the verge of telling Ron and Hermione
about his scar hurting again, and about the dream that had awoken
him . . . but he really didn’t want to worry them just now, not
when he himself was feeling so happy and peaceful.
“Look at the time,” Mrs. Weasley said suddenly, checking her
wristwatch. “You really should be in bed, the whole lot of you —
you’ll be up at the crack of dawn to get to the Cup. Harry, if you
leave your school list out, I’ll get your things for you tomorrow in
Diagon Alley. I’m getting everyone else’s. There might not be time
after the World Cup, the match went on for five days last time.”
“Wow — hope it does this time!” said Harry enthusiastically.
“Well, I certainly don’t,” said Percy sanctimoniously. “I shudder
to think what the state of my in-tray would be if I was away from
work for five days.”
“Yeah, someone might slip dragon dung in it again, eh, Perce?”
said Fred.
“That was a sample of fertilizer from Norway!” said Percy, going
very red in the face. “It was nothing personal !”
“It was,” Fred whispered to Harry as they got up from the table.
“We sent it.”

arry felt as though he had barely lain down to sleep in
Ron’s room when he was being shaken awake by Mrs.

Weasley.
“Time to go, Harry, dear,” she whispered, moving away to wake
Ron.
Harry felt around for his glasses, put them on, and sat up. It was
still dark outside. Ron muttered indistinctly as his mother roused
him. At the foot of Harry’s mattress he saw two large, disheveled
shapes emerging from tangles of blankets.
“ ’S’ time already?” said Fred groggily.
They dressed in silence, too sleepy to talk, then, yawning and
stretching, the four of them headed downstairs into the kitchen.
Mrs. Weasley was stirring the contents of a large pot on the
stove, while Mr. Weasley was sitting at the table, checking a sheaf
of large parchment tickets. He looked up as the boys entered and
spread his arms so that they could see his clothes more clearly. He




CHAPTER SIX
was wearing what appeared to be a golfing sweater and a very old
pair of jeans, slightly too big for him and held up with a thick
leather belt.
“What d’you think?” he asked anxiously. “We’re supposed to go
incognito — do I look like a Muggle, Harry?”
“Yeah,” said Harry, smiling, “very good.”
“Where’re Bill and Charlie and Per-Per-Percy?” said George, failing to stifle a huge yawn.
“Well, they’re Apparating, aren’t they?” said Mrs. Weasley, heaving the large pot over to the table and starting to ladle porridge into
bowls. “So they can have a bit of a lie-in.”
Harry knew that Apparating meant disappearing from one place
and reappearing almost instantly in another, but had never known
any Hogwarts student to do it, and understood that it was very
difficult.
“So they’re still in bed?” said Fred grumpily, pulling his bowl of
porridge toward him. “Why can’t we Apparate too?”
“Because you’re not of age and you haven’t passed your test,”
snapped Mrs. Weasley. “And where have those girls got to?”
She bustled out of the kitchen and they heard her climbing the
stairs.
“You have to pass a test to Apparate?” Harry asked.
“Oh yes,” said Mr. Weasley, tucking the tickets safely into the
back pocket of his jeans. “The Department of Magical Transportation had to fine a couple of people the other day for Apparating
without a license. It’s not easy, Apparition, and when it’s not done
properly it can lead to nasty complications. This pair I’m talking
about went and splinched themselves.”
Everyone around the table except Harry winced.


66



THE PORTKEY
“Er — splinched ?” said Harry.
“They left half of themselves behind,” said Mr. Weasley, now
spooning large amounts of treacle onto his porridge. “So, of course,
they were stuck. Couldn’t move either way. Had to wait for the
Accidental Magic Reversal Squad to sort them out. Meant a fair old
bit of paperwork, I can tell you, what with the Muggles who spotted the body parts they’d left behind. . . .”
Harry had a sudden vision of a pair of legs and an eyeball lying
abandoned on the pavement of Privet Drive.
“Were they okay?” he asked, startled.
“Oh yes,” said Mr. Weasley matter-of-factly. “But they got a
heavy fine, and I don’t think they’ll be trying it again in a hurry.
You don’t mess around with Apparition. There are plenty of adult
wizards who don’t bother with it. Prefer brooms — slower, but
safer.”
“But Bill and Charlie and Percy can all do it?”
“Charlie had to take the test twice,” said Fred, grinning. “He
failed the first time, Apparated five miles south of where he meant
to, right on top of some poor old dear doing her shopping,
remember?”
“Yes, well, he passed the second time,” said Mrs. Weasley,
marching back into the kitchen amid hearty sniggers.
“Percy only passed two weeks ago,” said George. “He’s been
Apparating downstairs every morning since, just to prove he can.”
There were footsteps down the passageway and Hermione and
Ginny came into the kitchen, both looking pale and drowsy.
“Why do we have to be up so early?” Ginny said, rubbing her
eyes and sitting down at the table.
“We’ve got a bit of a walk,” said Mr. Weasley.


67



CHAPTER SIX
“Walk?” said Harry. “What, are we walking to the World Cup?”
“No, no, that’s miles away,” said Mr. Weasley, smiling. “We only
need to walk a short way. It’s just that it’s very difficult for a large
number of wizards to congregate without attracting Muggle attention. We have to be very careful about how we travel at the best of
times, and on a huge occasion like the Quidditch World Cup —”
“George!” said Mrs. Weasley sharply, and they all jumped.
“What?” said George, in an innocent tone that deceived nobody.
“What is that in your pocket?”
“Nothing!”
“Don’t you lie to me!”
Mrs. Weasley pointed her wand at George’s pocket and said,
“Accio!”
Several small, brightly colored objects zoomed out of George’s
pocket; he made a grab for them but missed, and they sped right
into Mrs. Weasley’s outstretched hand.
“We told you to destroy them!” said Mrs. Weasley furiously,
holding up what were unmistakably more Ton-Tongue Toffees.
“We told you to get rid of the lot! Empty your pockets, go on, both
of you!”
It was an unpleasant scene; the twins had evidently been trying
to smuggle as many toffees out of the house as possible, and it was
only by using her Summoning Charm that Mrs. Weasley managed
to find them all.
“Accio! Accio! Accio!” she shouted, and toffees zoomed from all
sorts of unlikely places, including the lining of George’s jacket and
the turn-ups of Fred’s jeans.
“We spent six months developing those!” Fred shouted at his
mother as she threw the toffees away.


68



THE PORTKEY
“Oh a fine way to spend six months!” she shrieked. “No wonder
you didn’t get more O.W.L.s!”
All in all, the atmosphere was not very friendly as they took their
departure. Mrs. Weasley was still glowering as she kissed Mr.
Weasley on the cheek, though not nearly as much as the twins, who
had each hoisted their rucksacks onto their backs and walked out
without a word to her.
“Well, have a lovely time,” said Mrs. Weasley, “and behave yourselves,” she called after the twins’ retreating backs, but they did not
look back or answer. “I’ll send Bill, Charlie, and Percy along
around midday,” Mrs. Weasley said to Mr. Weasley, as he, Harry,
Ron, Hermione, and Ginny set off across the dark yard after Fred
and George.
It was chilly and the moon was still out. Only a dull, greenish
tinge along the horizon to their right showed that daybreak was
drawing closer. Harry, having been thinking about thousands of
wizards speeding toward the Quidditch World Cup, sped up to
walk with Mr. Weasley.
“So how does everyone get there without all the Muggles noticing?” he asked.
“It’s been a massive organizational problem,” sighed Mr.
Weasley. “The trouble is, about a hundred thousand wizards turn
up at the World Cup, and of course, we just haven’t got a magical
site big enough to accommodate them all. There are places Muggles can’t penetrate, but imagine trying to pack a hundred thousand
wizards into Diagon Alley or platform nine and three-quarters. So
we had to find a nice deserted moor, and set up as many antiMuggle precautions as possible. The whole Ministry’s been working on it for months. First, of course, we have to stagger the


CHAPTER SIX
arrivals. People with cheaper tickets have to arrive two weeks
beforehand. A limited number use Muggle transport, but we can’t
have too many clogging up their buses and trains — remember,
wizards are coming from all over the world. Some Apparate, of
course, but we have to set up safe points for them to appear, well
away from Muggles. I believe there’s a handy wood they’re using as
the Apparition point. For those who don’t want to Apparate, or
can’t, we use Portkeys. They’re objects that are used to transport
wizards from one spot to another at a prearranged time. You can do
large groups at a time if you need to. There have been two hundred
Portkeys placed at strategic points around Britain, and the nearest
one to us is up at the top of Stoatshead Hill, so that’s where we’re
headed.”
Mr. Weasley pointed ahead of them, where a large black mass
rose beyond the village of Ottery St. Catchpole.
“What sort of objects are Portkeys?” said Harry curiously.
“Well, they can be anything,” said Mr. Weasley. “Unobtrusive
things, obviously, so Muggles don’t go picking them up and playing with them . . . stuff they’ll just think is litter. . . .”
They trudged down the dark, dank lane toward the village, the
silence broken only by their footsteps. The sky lightened very
slowly as they made their way through the village, its inky blackness diluting to deepest blue. Harry’s hands and feet were freezing.
Mr. Weasley kept checking his watch.
They didn’t have breath to spare for talking as they began to
climb Stoatshead Hill, stumbling occasionally in hidden rabbit
holes, slipping on thick black tuffets of grass. Each breath Harry
took was sharp in his chest and his legs were starting to seize up
when, at last, his feet found level ground.

THE PORTKEY
“Whew,” panted Mr. Weasley, taking off his glasses and wiping
them on his sweater. “Well, we’ve made good time — we’ve got ten
minutes. . . .”
Hermione came over the crest of the hill last, clutching a stitch
in her side.
“Now we just need the Portkey,” said Mr. Weasley, replacing his
glasses and squinting around at the ground. “It won’t be big. . . .
Come on . . .”
They spread out, searching. They had only been at it for a couple of minutes, however, when a shout rent the still air.
“Over here, Arthur! Over here, son, we’ve got it!”
Two tall figures were silhouetted against the starry sky on the
other side of the hilltop.
“Amos!” said Mr. Weasley, smiling as he strode over to the man
who had shouted. The rest of them followed.
Mr. Weasley was shaking hands with a ruddy-faced wizard with
a scrubby brown beard, who was holding a moldy-looking old boot
in his other hand.
“This is Amos Diggory, everyone,” said Mr. Weasley. “He works
for the Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical
Creatures. And I think you know his son, Cedric?”
Cedric Diggory was an extremely handsome boy of around seventeen. He was Captain and Seeker of the Hufflepuff House Quidditch team at Hogwarts.
“Hi,” said Cedric, looking around at them all.
Everybody said hi back except Fred and George, who merely
nodded. They had never quite forgiven Cedric for beating their
team, Gryffindor, in the first Quidditch match of the previous year.
“Long walk, Arthur?” Cedric’s father asked.


CHAPTER SIX
“Not too bad,” said Mr. Weasley. “We live just on the other side
of the village there. You?”
“Had to get up at two, didn’t we, Ced? I tell you, I’ll be glad
when he’s got his Apparition test. Still . . . not complaining . . .
Quidditch World Cup, wouldn’t miss it for a sackful of Galleons — and the tickets cost about that. Mind you, looks like I got
off easy. . . .” Amos Diggory peered good-naturedly around at the
three Weasley boys, Harry, Hermione, and Ginny. “All these yours,
Arthur?”
“Oh no, only the redheads,” said Mr. Weasley, pointing out his
children. “This is Hermione, friend of Ron’s — and Harry, another friend —”
“Merlin’s beard,” said Amos Diggory, his eyes widening. “Harry?
Harry Potter?”
“Er — yeah,” said Harry.
Harry was used to people looking curiously at him when they
met him, used to the way their eyes moved at once to the lightning
scar on his forehead, but it always made him feel uncomfortable.
“Ced’s talked about you, of course,” said Amos Diggory. “Told
us all about playing against you last year. . . . I said to him, I
said — Ced, that’ll be something to tell your grandchildren, that
will. . . . You beat Harry Potter!”
Harry couldn’t think of any reply to this, so he remained silent.
Fred and George were both scowling again. Cedric looked slightly
embarrassed.
“Harry fell off his broom, Dad,” he muttered. “I told you . . . it
was an accident. . . .”
“Yes, but you didn’t fall off, did you?” roared Amos genially, slapping his son on his back. “Always modest, our Ced, always the gen

tleman . . . but the best man won, I’m sure Harry’d say the same,
wouldn’t you, eh? One falls off his broom, one stays on, you don’t
need to be a genius to tell which one’s the better flier!”
“Must be nearly time,” said Mr. Weasley quickly, pulling out his
watch again. “Do you know whether we’re waiting for any more,
Amos?”
“No, the Lovegoods have been there for a week already and the
Fawcetts couldn’t get tickets,” said Mr. Diggory. “There aren’t any
more of us in this area, are there?”
“Not that I know of,” said Mr. Weasley. “Yes, it’s a minute
off. . . . We’d better get ready. . . .”
He looked around at Harry and Hermione.
“You just need to touch the Portkey, that’s all, a finger will do —”
With difficulty, owing to their bulky backpacks, the nine of
them crowded around the old boot held out by Amos Diggory.
They all stood there, in a tight circle, as a chill breeze swept over
the hilltop. Nobody spoke. It suddenly occurred to Harry how odd
this would look if a Muggle were to walk up here now . . . nine
people, two of them grown men, clutching this manky old boot in
the semidarkness, waiting. . . .
“Three . . .” muttered Mr. Weasley, one eye still on his watch,
“two . . . one . . .”
It happened immediately: Harry felt as though a hook just behind his navel had been suddenly jerked irresistibly forward. His
feet left the ground; he could feel Ron and Hermione on either side
of him, their shoulders banging into his; they were all speeding forward in a howl of wind and swirling color; his forefinger was stuck
to the boot as though it was pulling him magnetically onward and
then —

His feet slammed into the ground; Ron staggered into him and
he fell over; the Portkey hit the ground near his head with a heavy
thud.
Harry looked up. Mr. Weasley, Mr. Diggory, and Cedric were
still standing, though looking very windswept; everybody else was
on the ground.
“Seven past five from Stoatshead Hill,” said a voice.

arry disentangled himself from Ron and got to his feet.
They had arrived on what appeared to be a deserted
stretch of misty moor. In front of them was a pair of tired and
grumpy-looking wizards, one of whom was holding a large gold
watch, the other a thick roll of parchment and a quill. Both were
dressed as Muggles, though very inexpertly: The man with the
watch wore a tweed suit with thigh-length galoshes; his colleague,
a kilt and a poncho.
“Morning, Basil,” said Mr. Weasley, picking up the boot and
handing it to the kilted wizard, who threw it into a large box of
used Portkeys beside him; Harry could see an old newspaper, an
empty drinks can, and a punctured football.
“Hello there, Arthur,” said Basil wearily. “Not on duty, eh? It’s all
right for some. . . . We’ve been here all night. . . . You’d better get
out of the way, we’ve got a big party coming in from the Black Forest at five-fifteen. Hang on, I’ll find your campsite. . . . Weasley . . .

Weasley . . .” He consulted his parchment list. “About a quarter of
a mile’s walk over there, first field you come to. Site manager’s called
Mr. Roberts. Diggory . . . second field . . . ask for Mr. Payne.”
“Thanks, Basil,” said Mr. Weasley, and he beckoned everyone to
follow him.
They set off across the deserted moor, unable to make out much
through the mist. After about twenty minutes, a small stone cottage next to a gate swam into view. Beyond it, Harry could just
make out the ghostly shapes of hundreds and hundreds of tents,
rising up the gentle slope of a large field toward a dark wood on the
horizon. They said good-bye to the Diggorys and approached the
cottage door.
A man was standing in the doorway, looking out at the tents.
Harry knew at a glance that this was the only real Muggle for several acres. When he heard their footsteps, he turned his head to
look at them.
“Morning!” said Mr. Weasley brightly.
“Morning,” said the Muggle.
“Would you be Mr. Roberts?”
“Aye, I would,” said Mr. Roberts. “And who’re you?”
“Weasley — two tents, booked a couple of days ago?”
“Aye,” said Mr. Roberts, consulting a list tacked to the door.
“You’ve got a space up by the wood there. Just the one night?”
“That’s it,” said Mr. Weasley.
“You’ll be paying now, then?” said Mr. Roberts.
“Ah — right — certainly —” said Mr. Weasley. He retreated a
short distance from the cottage and beckoned Harry toward him.
“Help me, Harry,” he muttered, pulling a roll of Muggle money
from his pocket and starting to peel the notes apart. “This one’s

a — a — a ten? Ah yes, I see the little number on it now. . . . So
this is a five?”
“A twenty,” Harry corrected him in an undertone, uncomfortably aware of Mr. Roberts trying to catch every word.
“Ah yes, so it is. . . . I don’t know, these little bits of paper . . .”
“You foreign?” said Mr. Roberts as Mr. Weasley returned with
the correct notes.
“Foreign?” repeated Mr. Weasley, puzzled.
“You’re not the first one who’s had trouble with money,” said
Mr. Roberts, scrutinizing Mr. Weasley closely. “I had two try and
pay me with great gold coins the size of hubcaps ten minutes ago.”
“Did you really?” said Mr. Weasley nervously.
Mr. Roberts rummaged around in a tin for some change.
“Never been this crowded,” he said suddenly, looking out over
the misty field again. “Hundreds of pre-bookings. People usually
just turn up. . . .”
“Is that right?” said Mr. Weasley, his hand held out for his
change, but Mr. Roberts didn’t give it to him.
“Aye,” he said thoughtfully. “People from all over. Loads of foreigners. And not just foreigners. Weirdos, you know? There’s a
bloke walking ’round in a kilt and a poncho.”
“Shouldn’t he?” said Mr. Weasley anxiously.
“It’s like some sort of . . . I dunno . . . like some sort of rally,”
said Mr. Roberts. “They all seem to know each other. Like a big
party.”
At that moment, a wizard in plus-fours appeared out of thin air
next to Mr. Roberts’s front door.
“Obliviate!” he said sharply, pointing his wand at Mr. Roberts.
Instantly, Mr. Roberts’s eyes slid out of focus, his brows


CHAPTER SEVEN
unknitted, and a look of dreamy unconcern fell over his face.
Harry recognized the symptoms of one who had just had his memory modified.
“A map of the campsite for you,” Mr. Roberts said placidly to
Mr. Weasley. “And your change.”
“Thanks very much,” said Mr. Weasley.
The wizard in plus-fours accompanied them toward the gate to
the campsite. He looked exhausted: His chin was blue with stubble
and there were deep purple shadows under his eyes. Once out of
earshot of Mr. Roberts, he muttered to Mr. Weasley, “Been having
a lot of trouble with him. Needs a Memory Charm ten times a day
to keep him happy. And Ludo Bagman’s not helping. Trotting
around talking about Bludgers and Quaffles at the top of his voice,
not a worry about anti-Muggle security. Blimey, I’ll be glad when
this is over. See you later, Arthur.”
He Disapparated.
“I thought Mr. Bagman was Head of Magical Games and
Sports,” said Ginny, looking surprised. “He should know better
than to talk about Bludgers near Muggles, shouldn’t he?”
“He should,” said Mr. Weasley, smiling, and leading them
through the gates into the campsite, “but Ludo’s always been a
bit . . . well . . . lax about security. You couldn’t wish for a more
enthusiastic head of the sports department though. He played
Quidditch for England himself, you know. And he was the best
Beater the Wimbourne Wasps ever had.”
They trudged up the misty field between long rows of tents.
Most looked almost ordinary; their owners had clearly tried to
make them as Muggle-like as possible, but had slipped up by
adding chimneys, or bellpulls, or weather vanes. However, here and


78



BAGMAN AND CROUCH
there was a tent so obviously magical that Harry could hardly be
surprised that Mr. Roberts was getting suspicious. Halfway up the
field stood an extravagant confection of striped silk like a miniature
palace, with several live peacocks tethered at the entrance. A little
farther on they passed a tent that had three floors and several turrets; and a short way beyond that was a tent that had a front garden
attached, complete with birdbath, sundial, and fountain.
“Always the same,” said Mr. Weasley, smiling. “We can’t resist
showing off when we get together. Ah, here we are, look, this is us.”
They had reached the very edge of the wood at the top of the
field, and here was an empty space, with a small sign hammered into
the ground that read weezly.
“Couldn’t have a better spot!” said Mr. Weasley happily. “The
field is just on the other side of the wood there, we’re as close as we
could be.” He hoisted his backpack from his shoulders. “Right,” he
said excitedly, “no magic allowed, strictly speaking, not when we’re
out in these numbers on Muggle land. We’ll be putting these tents
up by hand! Shouldn’t be too difficult. . . . Muggles do it all the
time. . . . Here, Harry, where do you reckon we should start?”
Harry had never been camping in his life; the Dursleys had
never taken him on any kind of holiday, preferring to leave him
with Mrs. Figg, an old neighbor. However, he and Hermione
worked out where most of the poles and pegs should go, and
though Mr. Weasley was more of a hindrance than a help, because
he got thoroughly overexcited when it came to using the mallet,
they finally managed to erect a pair of shabby two-man tents.
All of them stood back to admire their handiwork. Nobody
looking at these tents would guess they belonged to wizards, Harry
thought, but the trouble was that once Bill, Charlie, and Percy


79

CHAPTER SEVEN
arrived, they would be a party of ten. Hermione seemed to have
spotted this problem too; she gave Harry a quizzical look as Mr.
Weasley dropped to his hands and knees and entered the first tent.
“We’ll be a bit cramped,” he called, “but I think we’ll all squeeze
in. Come and have a look.”
Harry bent down, ducked under the tent flap, and felt his jaw
drop. He had walked into what looked like an old-fashioned,
three-room flat, complete with bathroom and kitchen. Oddly
enough, it was furnished in exactly the same sort of style as Mrs.
Figg’s house: There were crocheted covers on the mismatched
chairs and a strong smell of cats.
“Well, it’s not for long,” said Mr. Weasley, mopping his bald
patch with a handkerchief and peering in at the four bunk beds
that stood in the bedroom. “I borrowed this from Perkins at the office. Doesn’t camp much anymore, poor fellow, he’s got lumbago.”
He picked up the dusty kettle and peered inside it. “We’ll need
water. . . .”
“There’s a tap marked on this map the Muggle gave us,” said
Ron, who had followed Harry inside the tent and seemed completely unimpressed by its extraordinary inner proportions. “It’s on
the other side of the field.”
“Well, why don’t you, Harry, and Hermione go and get us some
water then” — Mr. Weasley handed over the kettle and a couple of
saucepans — “and the rest of us will get some wood for a fire?”
“But we’ve got an oven,” said Ron. “Why can’t we just —”
“Ron, anti-Muggle security!” said Mr. Weasley, his face shining
with anticipation. “When real Muggles camp, they cook on fires
outdoors. I’ve seen them at it!”
After a quick tour of the girls’ tent, which was slightly smaller


80



BAGMAN AND CROUCH
than the boys’, though without the smell of cats, Harry, Ron, and
Hermione set off across the campsite with the kettle and saucepans.
Now, with the sun newly risen and the mist lifting, they could
see the city of tents that stretched in every direction. They made
their way slowly through the rows, staring eagerly around. It was
only just dawning on Harry how many witches and wizards there
must be in the world; he had never really thought much about
those in other countries.
Their fellow campers were starting to wake up. First to stir were
the families with small children; Harry had never seen witches and
wizards this young before. A tiny boy no older than two was
crouched outside a large pyramid-shaped tent, holding a wand and
poking happily at a slug in the grass, which was swelling slowly to
the size of a salami. As they drew level with him, his mother came
hurrying out of the tent.
“How many times, Kevin? You don’t — touch — Daddy’s —
wand — yecchh!”
She had trodden on the giant slug, which burst. Her scolding
carried after them on the still air, mingling with the little boy’s
yells — “You bust slug! You bust slug!”
A short way farther on, they saw two little witches, barely older
than Kevin, who were riding toy broomsticks that rose only high
enough for the girls’ toes to skim the dewy grass. A Ministry wizard had already spotted them; as he hurried past Harry, Ron, and
Hermione he muttered distractedly, “In broad daylight! Parents
having a lie-in, I suppose —”
Here and there adult wizards and witches were emerging from
their tents and starting to cook breakfast. Some, with furtive looks
around them, conjured fires with their wands; others were striking


81



CHAPTER SEVEN
matches with dubious looks on their faces, as though sure this
couldn’t work. Three African wizards sat in serious conversation, all
of them wearing long white robes and roasting what looked like
a rabbit on a bright purple fire, while a group of middle-aged
American witches sat gossiping happily beneath a spangled banner
stretched between their tents that read: the salem witches’
institute. Harry caught snatches of conversation in strange languages from the inside of tents they passed, and though he couldn’t
understand a word, the tone of every single voice was excited.
“Er — is it my eyes, or has everything gone green?” said Ron.
It wasn’t just Ron’s eyes. They had walked into a patch of tents
that were all covered with a thick growth of shamrocks, so that it
looked as though small, oddly shaped hillocks had sprouted out of
the earth. Grinning faces could be seen under those that had their
flaps open. Then, from behind them, they heard their names.
“Harry! Ron! Hermione!”
It was Seamus Finnigan, their fellow Gryffindor fourth year. He
was sitting in front of his own shamrock-covered tent, with a
sandy-haired woman who had to be his mother, and his best friend,
Dean Thomas, also of Gryffindor.
“Like the decorations?” said Seamus, grinning. “The Ministry’s
not too happy.”
“Ah, why shouldn’t we show our colors?” said Mrs. Finnigan.
“You should see what the Bulgarians have got dangling all over
their tents. You’ll be supporting Ireland, of course?” she added, eyeing Harry, Ron, and Hermione beadily. When they had assured her
that they were indeed supporting Ireland, they set off again,
though, as Ron said, “Like we’d say anything else surrounded by
that lot.”


82



BAGMAN AND CROUCH
“I wonder what the Bulgarians have got dangling all over their
tents?” said Hermione.
“Let’s go and have a look,” said Harry, pointing to a large patch
of tents upheld, where the Bulgarian flag — white, green, and
red — was fluttering in the breeze.
The tents here had not been bedecked with plant life, but each
and every one of them had the same poster attached to it, a poster
of a very surly face with heavy black eyebrows. The picture was, of
course, moving, but all it did was blink and scowl.
“Krum,” said Ron quietly.
“What?” said Hermione.
“Krum!” said Ron. “Viktor Krum, the Bulgarian Seeker!”
“He looks really grumpy,” said Hermione, looking around at the
many Krums blinking and scowling at them.
“ ‘Really grumpy ’?” Ron raised his eyes to the heavens. “Who cares
what he looks like? He’s unbelievable. He’s really young too. Only
just eighteen or something. He’s a genius, you wait until tonight,
you’ll see.”
There was already a small queue for the tap in the corner of the
field. Harry, Ron, and Hermione joined it, right behind a pair of
men who were having a heated argument. One of them was a very
old wizard who was wearing a long flowery nightgown. The other
was clearly a Ministry wizard; he was holding out a pair of pinstriped trousers and almost crying with exasperation.
“Just put them on, Archie, there’s a good chap. You can’t walk
around like that, the Muggle at the gate’s already getting suspicious —”
“I bought this in a Muggle shop,” said the old wizard stubbornly.
“Muggles wear them.”


83



CHAPTER SEVEN
“Muggle women wear them, Archie, not the men, they wear
these,” said the Ministry wizard, and he brandished the pinstriped
trousers.
“I’m not putting them on,” said old Archie in indignation. “I
like a healthy breeze ’round my privates, thanks.”
Hermione was overcome with such a strong fit of the giggles at
this point that she had to duck out of the queue and only returned
when Archie had collected his water and moved away.
Walking more slowly now, because of the weight of the water,
they made their way back through the campsite. Here and there,
they saw more familiar faces: other Hogwarts students with their
families. Oliver Wood, the old captain of Harry’s House Quidditch
team, who had just left Hogwarts, dragged Harry over to his parents’ tent to introduce him, and told him excitedly that he had just
been signed to the Puddlemere United reserve team. Next they
were hailed by Ernie Macmillan, a Hufflepuff fourth year, and a little farther on they saw Cho Chang, a very pretty girl who played
Seeker on the Ravenclaw team. She waved and smiled at Harry,
who slopped quite a lot of water down his front as he waved back.
More to stop Ron from smirking than anything, Harry hurriedly
pointed out a large group of teenagers whom he had never seen
before.
“Who d’you reckon they are?” he said. “They don’t go to Hogwarts, do they?”
“ ’Spect they go to some foreign school,” said Ron. “I know there
are others. Never met anyone who went to one, though. Bill had a
penfriend at a school in Brazil . . . this was years and years ago . . .
and he wanted to go on an exchange trip but Mum and Dad couldn’t


84



BAGMAN AND CROUCH
afford it. His penfriend got all offended when he said he wasn’t going
and sent him a cursed hat. It made his ears shrivel up.”
Harry laughed but didn’t voice the amazement he felt at hearing
about other wizarding schools. He supposed, now that he saw representatives of so many nationalities in the campsite, that he had
been stupid never to realize that Hogwarts couldn’t be the only
one. He glanced at Hermione, who looked utterly unsurprised by
the information. No doubt she had run across the news about
other wizarding schools in some book or other.
“You’ve been ages,” said George when they finally got back to
the Weasleys’ tents.
“Met a few people,” said Ron, setting the water down. “You not
got that fire started yet?”
“Dad’s having fun with the matches,” said Fred.
Mr. Weasley was having no success at all in lighting the fire, but
it wasn’t for lack of trying. Splintered matches littered the ground
around him, but he looked as though he was having the time of his
life.
“Oops!” he said as he managed to light a match and promptly
dropped it in surprise.
“Come here, Mr. Weasley,” said Hermione kindly, taking the
box from him, and showing him how to do it properly.
At last they got the fire lit, though it was at least another hour
before it was hot enough to cook anything. There was plenty to
watch while they waited, however. Their tent seemed to be pitched
right alongside a kind of thoroughfare to the field, and Ministry
members kept hurrying up and down it, greeting Mr. Weasley cordially as they passed. Mr. Weasley kept up a running commentary,


85



CHAPTER SEVEN
mainly for Harry’s and Hermione’s benefit; his own children knew
too much about the Ministry to be greatly interested.
“That was Cuthbert Mockridge, Head of the Goblin Liaison
Office. . . . Here comes Gilbert Wimple; he’s with the Committee
on Experimental Charms; he’s had those horns for a while now. . . .
Hello, Arnie . . . Arnold Peasegood, he’s an Obliviator — member
of the Accidental Magic Reversal Squad, you know. . . . and that’s
Bode and Croaker . . . they’re Unspeakables. . . .”
“They’re what?”
“From the Department of Mysteries, top secret, no idea what
they get up to. . . .”
At last, the fire was ready, and they had just started cooking eggs
and sausages when Bill, Charlie, and Percy came strolling out of the
woods toward them.
“Just Apparated, Dad,” said Percy loudly. “Ah, excellent, lunch!”
They were halfway through their plates of eggs and sausages
when Mr. Weasley jumped to his feet, waving and grinning at a
man who was striding toward them. “Aha!” he said. “The man of
the moment! Ludo!”
Ludo Bagman was easily the most noticeable person Harry had
seen so far, even including old Archie in his flowered nightdress.
He was wearing long Quidditch robes in thick horizontal stripes of
bright yellow and black. An enormous picture of a wasp was
splashed across his chest. He had the look of a powerfully built
man gone slightly to seed; the robes were stretched tightly across a
large belly he surely had not had in the days when he had played
Quidditch for England. His nose was squashed (probably broken
by a stray Bludger, Harry thought), but his round blue eyes, short


86



BAGMAN AND CROUCH
blond hair, and rosy complexion made him look like a very overgrown schoolboy.
“Ahoy there!” Bagman called happily. He was walking as though
he had springs attached to the balls of his feet and was plainly in a
state of wild excitement.
“Arthur, old man,” he puffed as he reached the campfire, “what
a day, eh? What a day! Could we have asked for more perfect
weather? A cloudless night coming . . . and hardly a hiccough in
the arrangements. . . . Not much for me to do!”
Behind him, a group of haggard-looking Ministry wizards
rushed past, pointing at the distant evidence of some sort of a magical fire that was sending violet sparks twenty feet into the air.
Percy hurried forward with his hand outstretched. Apparently
his disapproval of the way Ludo Bagman ran his department did
not prevent him from wanting to make a good impression.
“Ah — yes,” said Mr. Weasley, grinning, “this is my son Percy.
He’s just started at the Ministry — and this is Fred — no, George,
sorry — that’s Fred — Bill, Charlie, Ron — my daughter, Ginny —
and Ron’s friends, Hermione Granger and Harry Potter.”
Bagman did the smallest of double takes when he heard Harry’s
name, and his eyes performed the familiar flick upward to the scar
on Harry’s forehead.
“Everyone,” Mr. Weasley continued, “this is Ludo Bagman, you
know who he is, it’s thanks to him we’ve got such good tickets —”
Bagman beamed and waved his hand as if to say it had been
nothing.
“Fancy a flutter on the match, Arthur?” he said eagerly, jingling
what seemed to be a large amount of gold in the pockets of his

CHAPTER SEVEN
yellow-and-black robes. “I’ve already got Roddy Pontner betting
me Bulgaria will score first — I offered him nice odds, considering
Ireland’s front three are the strongest I’ve seen in years — and little
Agatha Timms has put up half shares in her eel farm on a weeklong match.”
“Oh . . . go on then,” said Mr. Weasley. “Let’s see . . . a Galleon
on Ireland to win?”
“A Galleon?” Ludo Bagman looked slightly disappointed, but recovered himself. “Very well, very well . . . any other takers?”
“They’re a bit young to be gambling,” said Mr. Weasley. “Molly
wouldn’t like —”
“We’ll bet thirty-seven Galleons, fifteen Sickles, three Knuts,”
said Fred as he and George quickly pooled all their money, “that
Ireland wins — but Viktor Krum gets the Snitch. Oh and we’ll
throw in a fake wand.”
“You don’t want to go showing Mr. Bagman rubbish like that —”
Percy hissed, but Bagman didn’t seem to think the wand was rubbish
at all; on the contrary, his boyish face shone with excitement as he
took it from Fred, and when the wand gave a loud squawk and
turned into a rubber chicken, Bagman roared with laughter.
“Excellent! I haven’t seen one that convincing in years! I’d pay
five Galleons for that!”
Percy froze in an attitude of stunned disapproval.
“Boys,” said Mr. Weasley under his breath, “I don’t want you
betting. . . . That’s all your savings. . . . Your mother —”
“Don’t be a spoilsport, Arthur!” boomed Ludo Bagman, rattling
his pockets excitedly. “They’re old enough to know what they
want! You reckon Ireland will win but Krum’ll get the Snitch? Not
a chance, boys, not a chance. . . . I’ll give you excellent odds on


88



BAGMAN AND CROUCH
that one. . . . We’ll add five Galleons for the funny wand, then,
shall we. . . .”
Mr. Weasley looked on helplessly as Ludo Bagman whipped out
a notebook and quill and began jotting down the twins’ names.
“Cheers,” said George, taking the slip of parchment Bagman
handed him and tucking it away carefully. Bagman turned most
cheerfully back to Mr. Weasley.
“Couldn’t do me a brew, I suppose? I’m keeping an eye out for
Barty Crouch. My Bulgarian opposite number’s making difficulties, and I can’t understand a word he’s saying. Barty’ll be able to
sort it out. He speaks about a hundred and fifty languages.”
“Mr. Crouch?” said Percy, suddenly abandoning his look of
poker-stiff disapproval and positively writhing with excitement.
“He speaks over two hundred! Mermish and Gobbledegook and
Troll . . .”
“Anyone can speak Troll,” said Fred dismissively. “All you have
to do is point and grunt.”
Percy threw Fred an extremely nasty look and stoked the fire vigorously to bring the kettle back to the boil.
“Any news of Bertha Jorkins yet, Ludo?” Mr. Weasley asked as
Bagman settled himself down on the grass beside them all.
“Not a dicky bird,” said Bagman comfortably. “But she’ll turn
up. Poor old Bertha . . . memory like a leaky cauldron and no sense
of direction. Lost, you take my word for it. She’ll wander back into
the office sometime in October, thinking it’s still July.”
“You don’t think it might be time to send someone to look for
her?” Mr. Weasley suggested tentatively as Percy handed Bagman
his tea.
“Barty Crouch keeps saying that,” said Bagman, his round eyes


89



CHAPTER SEVEN
widening innocently, “but we really can’t spare anyone at the moment. Oh — talk of the devil! Barty!”
A wizard had just Apparated at their fireside, and he could not
have made more of a contrast with Ludo Bagman, sprawled on the
grass in his old Wasp robes. Barty Crouch was a stiff, upright, elderly man, dressed in an impeccably crisp suit and tie. The parting
in his short gray hair was almost unnaturally straight, and his narrow toothbrush mustache looked as though he trimmed it using a
slide rule. His shoes were very highly polished. Harry could see at
once why Percy idolized him. Percy was a great believer in rigidly
following rules, and Mr. Crouch had complied with the rule about
Muggle dressing so thoroughly that he could have passed for a
bank manager; Harry doubted even Uncle Vernon would have
spotted him for what he really was.
“Pull up a bit of grass, Barty,” said Ludo brightly, patting the
ground beside him.
“No thank you, Ludo,” said Crouch, and there was a bite of impatience in his voice. “I’ve been looking for you everywhere. The
Bulgarians are insisting we add another twelve seats to the Top
Box.”
“Oh is that what they’re after?” said Bagman. “I thought the
chap was asking to borrow a pair of tweezers. Bit of a strong
accent.”
“Mr. Crouch!” said Percy breathlessly, sunk into a kind of halfbow that made him look like a hunchback. “Would you like a cup
of tea?”
“Oh,” said Mr. Crouch, looking over at Percy in mild surprise.
“Yes — thank you, Weatherby”


90



BAGMAN AND CROUCH
Fred and George choked into their own cups. Percy, very pink
around the ears, busied himself with the kettle.
“Oh and I’ve been wanting a word with you too, Arthur,” said
Mr. Crouch, his sharp eyes falling upon Mr. Weasley. “Ali Bashir’s
on the warpath. He wants a word with you about your embargo on
flying carpets.”
Mr. Weasley heaved a deep sigh.
“I sent him an owl about that just last week. If I’ve told him once
I’ve told him a hundred times: Carpets are defined as a Muggle Artifact by the Registry of Proscribed Charmable Objects, but will he
listen?”
“I doubt it,” said Mr. Crouch, accepting a cup from Percy. “He’s
desperate to export here.”
“Well, they’ll never replace brooms in Britain, will they?” said
Bagman.
“Ali thinks there’s a niche in the market for a family vehicle,”
said Mr. Crouch. “I remember my grandfather had an Axminster
that could seat twelve — but that was before carpets were banned,
of course.”
He spoke as though he wanted to leave nobody in any doubt
that all his ancestors had abided strictly by the law.
“So, been keeping busy, Barty?” said Bagman breezily.
“Fairly,” said Mr. Crouch dryly. “Organizing Portkeys across five
continents is no mean feat, Ludo.”
“I expect you’ll both be glad when this is over?” said Mr.
Weasley.
Ludo Bagman looked shocked.
“Glad! Don’t know when I’ve had more fun. . . . Still, it’s not as


91

CHAPTER SEVEN
though we haven’t got anything to look forward to, eh, Barty? Eh?
Plenty left to organize, eh?”
Mr. Crouch raised his eyebrows at Bagman.
“We agreed not to make the announcement until all the
details —”
“Oh details!” said Bagman, waving the word away like a cloud
of midges. “They’ve signed, haven’t they? They’ve agreed, haven’t
they? I bet you anything these kids’ll know soon enough anyway. I
mean, it’s happening at Hogwarts —”
“Ludo, we need to meet the Bulgarians, you know,” said Mr.
Crouch sharply, cutting Bagman’s remarks short. “Thank you for
the tea, Weatherby.”
He pushed his undrunk tea back at Percy and waited for Ludo to
rise; Bagman struggled to his feet, swigging down the last of his tea,
the gold in his pockets chinking merrily.
“See you all later!” he said. “You’ll be up in the Top Box with
me — I’m commentating!” He waved, Barty Crouch nodded
curtly, and both of them Disapparated.
“What’s happening at Hogwarts, Dad?” said Fred at once.
“What were they talking about?”
“You’ll find out soon enough,” said Mr.Weasley, smiling.
“It’s classified information, until such time as the Ministry decides to release it,” said Percy stiffly. “Mr. Crouch was quite right
not to disclose it.”
“Oh shut up, Weatherby,” said Fred.
A sense of excitement rose like a palpable cloud over the campsite as the afternoon wore on. By dusk, the still summer air itself
seemed to be quivering with anticipation, and as darkness spread
like a curtain over the thousands of waiting wizards, the last


92



BAGMAN AND CROUCH
vestiges of pretence disappeared: the Ministry seemed to have
bowed to the inevitable and stopped fighting the signs of blatant
magic now breaking out everywhere.
Salesmen were Apparating every few feet, carrying trays and
pushing carts full of extraordinary merchandise. There were luminous rosettes — green for Ireland, red for Bulgaria — which were
squealing the names of the players, pointed green hats bedecked
with dancing shamrocks, Bulgarian scarves adorned with lions that
really roared, flags from both countries that played their national
anthems as they were waved; there were tiny models of Firebolts
that really flew, and collectible figures of famous players, which
strolled across the palm of your hand, preening themselves.
“Been saving my pocket money all summer for this,” Ron told
Harry as they and Hermione strolled through the salesmen, buying
souvenirs. Though Ron purchased a dancing shamrock hat and a
large green rosette, he also bought a small figure of Viktor Krum,
the Bulgarian Seeker. The miniature Krum walked backward and
forward over Ron’s hand, scowling up at the green rosette above
him.
“Wow, look at these!” said Harry, hurrying over to a cart piled
high with what looked like brass binoculars, except that they were
covered with all sorts of weird knobs and dials.
“Omnioculars,” said the saleswizard eagerly. “You can replay action . . . slow everything down . . . and they flash up a play-by-play
breakdown if you need it. Bargain — ten Galleons each.”
“Wish I hadn’t bought this now,” said Ron, gesturing at his
dancing shamrock hat and gazing longingly at the Omnioculars.
“Three pairs,” said Harry firmly to the wizard.
“No — don’t bother,” said Ron, going red. He was always


93



CHAPTER SEVEN
touchy about the fact that Harry, who had inherited a small fortune from his parents, had much more money than he did.
“You won’t be getting anything for Christmas,” Harry told him,
thrusting Omnioculars into his and Hermione’s hands. “For about
ten years, mind.”
“Fair enough,” said Ron, grinning.
“Oooh, thanks, Harry,” said Hermione. “And I’ll get us some
programs, look —”
Their money bags considerably lighter, they went back to the
tents. Bill, Charlie, and Ginny were all sporting green rosettes too,
and Mr. Weasley was carrying an Irish flag. Fred and George had
no souvenirs as they had given Bagman all their gold.
And then a deep, booming gong sounded somewhere beyond
the woods, and at once, green and red lanterns blazed into life in
the trees, lighting a path to the field.
“It’s time!” said Mr. Weasley, looking as excited as any of them.
“Come on, let’s go!”

lutching their purchases, Mr. Weasley in the lead, they all
hurried into the wood, following the lantern-lit trail. They
could hear the sounds of thousands of people moving around
them, shouts and laughter, snatches of singing. The atmosphere of
feverish excitement was highly infectious; Harry couldn’t stop grinning. They walked through the wood for twenty minutes, talking
and joking loudly, until at last they emerged on the other side and
found themselves in the shadow of a gigantic stadium. Though
Harry could see only a fraction of the immense gold walls surrounding the field, he could tell that ten cathedrals would fit comfortably inside it.
“Seats a hundred thousand,” said Mr. Weasley, spotting the
awestruck look on Harry’s face. “Ministry task force of five hundred have been working on it all year. Muggle Repelling Charms
on every inch of it. Every time Muggles have got anywhere near
here all year, they’ve suddenly remembered urgent appointments

and had to dash away again . . . bless them,” he added fondly, leading the way toward the nearest entrance, which was already surrounded by a swarm of shouting witches and wizards.
“Prime seats!” said the Ministry witch at the entrance when she
checked their tickets. “Top Box! Straight upstairs, Arthur, and as
high as you can go.”
The stairs into the stadium were carpeted in rich purple. They
clambered upward with the rest of the crowd, which slowly filtered
away through doors into the stands to their left and right. Mr.
Weasley’s party kept climbing, and at last they reached the top of
the staircase and found themselves in a small box, set at the highest point of the stadium and situated exactly halfway between the
golden goal posts. About twenty purple-and-gilt chairs stood in
two rows here, and Harry, filing into the front seats with the
Weasleys, looked down upon a scene the likes of which he could
never have imagined.
A hundred thousand witches and wizards were taking their
places in the seats, which rose in levels around the long oval field.
Everything was suffused with a mysterious golden light, which
seemed to come from the stadium itself. The field looked smooth
as velvet from their lofty position. At either end of the field stood
three goal hoops, fifty feet high; right opposite them, almost at
Harry’s eye level, was a gigantic blackboard. Gold writing kept
dashing across it as though an invisible giant’s hand were scrawling
upon the blackboard and then wiping it off again; watching it,
Harry saw that it was flashing advertisements across the field.

Harry tore his eyes away from the sign and looked over his
shoulder to see who else was sharing the box with them. So far it
was empty, except for a tiny creature sitting in the second from last
seat at the end of the row behind them. The creature, whose legs
were so short they stuck out in front of it on the chair, was wearing
a tea towel draped like a toga, and it had its face hidden in its
hands. Yet those long, batlike ears were oddly familiar. . . .
“Dobby?” said Harry incredulously.
The tiny creature looked up and stretched its fingers, revealing
enormous brown eyes and a nose the exact size and shape of a large
tomato. It wasn’t Dobby — it was, however, unmistakably a houseelf, as Harry’s friend Dobby had been. Harry had set Dobby free
from his old owners, the Malfoy family.
“Did sir just call me Dobby?” squeaked the elf curiously from
between its fingers. Its voice was higher even than Dobby’s had
been, a teeny, quivering squeak of a voice, and Harry suspected —
though it was very hard to tell with a house-elf — that this one
might just be female. Ron and Hermione spun around in their
seats to look. Though they had heard a lot about Dobby from
Harry, they had never actually met him. Even Mr. Weasley looked
around in interest.
“Sorry,” Harry told the elf, “I just thought you were someone I
knew.”
“But I knows Dobby too, sir!” squeaked the elf. She was shielding her face, as though blinded by light, though the Top Box was

not brightly lit. “My name is Winky, sir — and you, sir —” Her
dark brown eyes widened to the size of side plates as they rested
upon Harry’s scar. “You is surely Harry Potter!”
“Yeah, I am,” said Harry.
“But Dobby talks of you all the time, sir!” she said, lowering her
hands very slightly and looking awestruck.
“How is he?” said Harry. “How’s freedom suiting him?”
“Ah, sir,” said Winky, shaking her head, “ah sir, meaning no disrespect, sir, but I is not sure you did Dobby a favor, sir, when you
is setting him free.”
“Why?” said Harry, taken aback. “What’s wrong with him?”
“Freedom is going to Dobby’s head, sir,” said Winky sadly.
“Ideas above his station, sir. Can’t get another position, sir.”
“Why not?” said Harry.
Winky lowered her voice by a half-octave and whispered, “He is
wanting paying for his work, sir.”
“Paying?” said Harry blankly. “Well — why shouldn’t he be
paid?”
Winky looked quite horrified at the idea and closed her fingers
slightly so that her face was half-hidden again.
“House-elves is not paid, sir!” she said in a muffled squeak. “No,
no, no. I says to Dobby, I says, go find yourself a nice family and
settle down, Dobby. He is getting up to all sorts of high jinks, sir,
what is unbecoming to a house-elf. You goes racketing around like
this, Dobby, I says, and next thing I hear you’s up in front of the
Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures,
like some common goblin.”
“Well, it’s about time he had a bit of fun,” said Harry.
“House-elves is not supposed to have fun, Harry Potter,” said


98



THE QUIDDITCH
WORLD CUP
Winky firmly, from behind her hands. “House-elves does what
they is told. I is not liking heights at all, Harry Potter” — she
glanced toward the edge of the box and gulped — “but my master
sends me to the Top Box and I comes, sir.”
“Why’s he sent you up here, if he knows you don’t like heights?”
said Harry, frowning.
“Master — master wants me to save him a seat, Harry Potter.
He is very busy,” said Winky, tilting her head toward the empty
space beside her. “Winky is wishing she is back in master’s tent,
Harry Potter, but Winky does what she is told. Winky is a good
house-elf.”
She gave the edge of the box another frightened look and hid her
eyes completely again. Harry turned back to the others.
“So that’s a house-elf?” Ron muttered. “Weird things, aren’t
they?”
“Dobby was weirder,” said Harry fervently.
Ron pulled out his Omnioculars and started testing them, staring down into the crowd on the other side of the stadium.
“Wild!” he said, twiddling the replay knob on the side. “I can
make that old bloke down there pick his nose again . . . and
again . . . and again . . .”
Hermione, meanwhile, was skimming eagerly through her velvetcovered, tasseled program.
“ ‘A display from the team mascots will precede the match,’ ” she
read aloud.
“Oh that’s always worth watching,” said Mr. Weasley. “National
teams bring creatures from their native land, you know, to put on
a bit of a show.”
The box filled gradually around them over the next half hour.

CHAPTER EIGHT
Mr. Weasley kept shaking hands with people who were obviously
very important wizards. Percy jumped to his feet so often that he
looked as though he were trying to sit on a hedgehog. When Cornelius Fudge, the Minister of Magic himself, arrived, Percy bowed
so low that his glasses fell off and shattered. Highly embarrassed, he
repaired them with his wand and thereafter remained in his seat,
throwing jealous looks at Harry, whom Cornelius Fudge had
greeted like an old friend. They had met before, and Fudge shook
Harry’s hand in a fatherly fashion, asked how he was, and introduced him to the wizards on either side of him.
“Harry Potter, you know,” he told the Bulgarian minister loudly,
who was wearing splendid robes of black velvet trimmed with gold
and didn’t seem to understand a word of English. “Harry Potter . . .
oh come on now, you know who he is . . . the boy who survived
You-Know-Who . . . you do know who he is —”
The Bulgarian wizard suddenly spotted Harry’s scar and started
gabbling loudly and excitedly, pointing at it.
“Knew we’d get there in the end,” said Fudge wearily to Harry.
“I’m no great shakes at languages; I need Barty Crouch for this sort
of thing. Ah, I see his house-elf’s saving him a seat. . . . Good job
too, these Bulgarian blighters have been trying to cadge all the best
places . . . ah, and here’s Lucius!”
Harry, Ron, and Hermione turned quickly. Edging along the
second row to three still-empty seats right behind Mr. Weasley
were none other than Dobby the house-elf’s former owners: Lucius
Malfoy; his son, Draco; and a woman Harry supposed must be
Draco’s mother.
Harry and Draco Malfoy had been enemies ever since their very
first journey to Hogwarts. A pale boy with a pointed face and


white-blond hair, Draco greatly resembled his father. His mother
was blonde too; tall and slim, she would have been nice-looking if
she hadn’t been wearing a look that suggested there was a nasty
smell under her nose.
“Ah, Fudge,” said Mr. Malfoy, holding out his hand as he
reached the Minister of Magic. “How are you? I don’t think you’ve
met my wife, Narcissa? Or our son, Draco?”
“How do you do, how do you do?” said Fudge, smiling and
bowing to Mrs. Malfoy. “And allow me to introduce you to Mr.
Oblansk — Obalonsk — Mr. — well, he’s the Bulgarian Minister
of Magic, and he can’t understand a word I’m saying anyway, so
never mind. And let’s see who else — you know Arthur Weasley, I
daresay?”
It was a tense moment. Mr. Weasley and Mr. Malfoy looked at
each other and Harry vividly recalled the last time they had come
face-to-face: It had been in Flourish and Blotts’ bookshop, and
they had had a fight. Mr. Malfoy’s cold gray eyes swept over Mr.
Weasley, and then up and down the row.
“Good lord, Arthur,” he said softly. “What did you have to sell
to get seats in the Top Box? Surely your house wouldn’t have
fetched this much?”
Fudge, who wasn’t listening, said, “Lucius has just given a very
generous contribution to St. Mungo’s Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries, Arthur. He’s here as my guest.”
“How — how nice,” said Mr. Weasley, with a very strained
smile.
Mr. Malfoy’s eyes had returned to Hermione, who went slightly
pink, but stared determinedly back at him. Harry knew exactly
what was making Mr. Malfoy’s lip curl like that. The Malfoys


CHAPTER EIGHT
prided themselves on being purebloods; in other words, they considered anyone of Muggle descent, like Hermione, second-class.
However, under the gaze of the Minister of Magic, Mr. Malfoy didn’t dare say anything. He nodded sneeringly to Mr. Weasley and
continued down the line to his seats. Draco shot Harry, Ron, and
Hermione one contemptuous look, then settled himself between
his mother and father.
“Slimy gits,” Ron muttered as he, Harry, and Hermione turned
to face the field again. Next moment, Ludo Bagman charged into
the box.
“Everyone ready?” he said, his round face gleaming like a great,
excited Edam. “Minister — ready to go?”
“Ready when you are, Ludo,” said Fudge comfortably.
Ludo whipped out his wand, directed it at his own throat, and
said “Sonorus!” and then spoke over the roar of sound that was now
filling the packed stadium; his voice echoed over them, booming
into every corner of the stands.
“Ladies and gentlemen . . . welcome! Welcome to the final of
the four hundred and twenty-second Quidditch World Cup!”
The spectators screamed and clapped. Thousands of flags waved,
adding their discordant national anthems to the racket. The huge
blackboard opposite them was wiped clear of its last message
( Bertie Bott’s Every Flavor Beans — A Risk With
Every Mouthful! ) and now showed BULGARIA: 0, IRELAND: 0.
“And now, without further ado, allow me to introduce . . . the
Bulgarian National Team Mascots!”
The right-hand side of the stands, which was a solid block of
scarlet, roared its approval.


THE QUIDDITCH
WORLD CUP
“I wonder what they’ve brought,” said Mr. Weasley, leaning forward in his seat. “Aaah!” He suddenly whipped off his glasses and
polished them hurriedly on his robes. “Veela!”
“What are veel — ?”
But a hundred veela were now gliding out onto the field, and
Harry’s question was answered for him. Veela were women . . . the
most beautiful women Harry had ever seen . . . except that they
weren’t — they couldn’t be — human. This puzzled Harry for a
moment while he tried to guess what exactly they could be; what
could make their skin shine moon-bright like that, or their whitegold hair fan out behind them without wind . . . but then the music started, and Harry stopped worrying about them not being
human — in fact, he stopped worrying about anything at all.
The veela had started to dance, and Harry’s mind had gone completely and blissfully blank. All that mattered in the world was that
he kept watching the veela, because if they stopped dancing, terrible things would happen. . . .
And as the veela danced faster and faster, wild, half-formed
thoughts started chasing through Harry’s dazed mind. He wanted to
do something very impressive, right now. Jumping from the box into
the stadium seemed a good idea . . . but would it be good enough?
“Harry, what are you doing?” said Hermione’s voice from a long
way off.
The music stopped. Harry blinked. He was standing up, and
one of his legs was resting on the wall of the box. Next to him, Ron
was frozen in an attitude that looked as though he were about to
dive from a springboard.
Angry yells were filling the stadium. The crowd didn’t want the


103



CHAPTER EIGHT
veela to go. Harry was with them; he would, of course, be supporting Bulgaria, and he wondered vaguely why he had a large
green shamrock pinned to his chest. Ron, meanwhile, was absentmindedly shredding the shamrocks on his hat. Mr. Weasley, smiling slightly, leaned over to Ron and tugged the hat out of his
hands.
“You’ll be wanting that,” he said, “once Ireland have had their
say.
“Huh?” said Ron, staring openmouthed at the veela, who had
now lined up along one side of the field.
Hermione made a loud tutting noise. She reached up and pulled
Harry back into his seat. “Honestly!” she said.
“And now,” roared Ludo Bagman’s voice, “kindly put your
wands in the air . . . for the Irish National Team Mascots!”
Next moment, what seemed to be a great green-and-gold comet
came zooming into the stadium. It did one circuit of the stadium,
then split into two smaller comets, each hurtling toward the goal
posts. A rainbow arced suddenly across the field, connecting the
two balls of light. The crowd oooohed and aaaaahed, as though at
a fireworks display. Now the rainbow faded and the balls of light reunited and merged; they had formed a great shimmering shamrock, which rose up into the sky and began to soar over the stands.
Something like golden rain seemed to be falling from it —
“Excellent!” yelled Ron as the shamrock soared over them, and
heavy gold coins rained from it, bouncing off their heads and seats.
Squinting up at the shamrock, Harry realized that it was actually
comprised of thousands of tiny little bearded men with red vests,
each carrying a minute lamp of gold or green.
“Leprechauns!” said Mr. Weasley over the tumultuous applause


104



THE QUIDDITCH
WORLD CUP
of the crowd, many of whom were still fighting and rummaging
around under their chairs to retrieve the gold.
“There you go,” Ron yelled happily, stuffing a fistful of gold
coins into Harry’s hand, “for the Omnioculars! Now you’ve got to
buy me a Christmas present, ha!”
The great shamrock dissolved, the leprechauns drifted down
onto the field on the opposite side from the veela, and settled
themselves cross-legged to watch the match.
“And now, ladies and gentlemen, kindly welcome — the Bulgarian National Quidditch Team! I give you — Dimitrov!”
A scarlet-clad figure on a broomstick, moving so fast it was
blurred, shot out onto the field from an entrance far below, to wild
applause from the Bulgarian supporters.
“Ivanova!”
A second scarlet-robed player zoomed out.
“Zograf! Levski! Vulchanov! Volkov! Aaaaaaand — Krum!”
“That’s him, that’s him!” yelled Ron, following Krum with his
Omnioculars. Harry quickly focused his own.
Viktor Krum was thin, dark, and sallow-skinned, with a large
curved nose and thick black eyebrows. He looked like an overgrown bird of prey. It was hard to believe he was only eighteen.
“And now, please greet — the Irish National Quidditch Team!”
yelled Bagman. “Presenting — Connolly! Ryan! Troy! Mullet!
Moran! Quigley! Aaaaaand — Lynch!”
Seven green blurs swept onto the field; Harry spun a small dial
on the side of his Omnioculars and slowed the players down
enough to read the word “Firebolt” on each of their brooms and see
their names, embroidered in silver, upon their backs.
“And here, all the way from Egypt, our referee, acclaimed

CHAPTER EIGHT
Chairwizard of the International Association of Quidditch, Hassan
Mostafa!”
A small and skinny wizard, completely bald but with a mustache
to rival Uncle Vernon’s, wearing robes of pure gold to match the
stadium, strode out onto the field. A silver whistle was protruding
from under the mustache, and he was carrying a large wooden crate
under one arm, his broomstick under the other. Harry spun the
speed dial on his Omnioculars back to normal, watching closely as
Mostafa mounted his broomstick and kicked the crate open —
four balls burst into the air: the scarlet Quaffle, the two black
Bludgers, and (Harry saw it for the briefest moment, before it sped
out of sight) the minuscule, winged Golden Snitch. With a sharp
blast on his whistle, Mostafa shot into the air after the balls.
“Theeeeeeeey’re OFF!” screamed Bagman. “And it’s Mullet!
Troy! Moran! Dimitrov! Back to Mullet! Troy! Levski! Moran!”
It was Quidditch as Harry had never seen it played before. He
was pressing his Omnioculars so hard to his glasses that they were
cutting into the bridge of his nose. The speed of the players was incredible — the Chasers were throwing the Quaffle to one another
so fast that Bagman only had time to say their names. Harry spun
the slow dial on the right of his Omnioculars again, pressed the
play-by-play button on the top, and he was immediately watching
in slow motion, while glittering purple lettering flashed across the
lenses and the noise of the crowd pounded against his eardrums.
H AWKSHEAD A TTACKING F ORMATION , he read as he watched the
three Irish Chasers zoom closely together, Troy in the center,
slightly ahead of Mullet and Moran, bearing down upon the Bulgarians. P ORSKOFF P LOY flashed up next, as Troy made as though to
dart upward with the Quaffle, drawing away the Bulgarian Chaser

Ivanova and dropping the Quaffle to Moran. One of the Bulgarian
Beaters, Volkov, swung hard at a passing Bludger with his small
club, knocking it into Moran’s path; Moran ducked to avoid the
Bludger and dropped the Quaffle; and Levski, soaring beneath,
caught it —
“TROY SCORES!” roared Bagman, and the stadium shuddered
with a roar of applause and cheers. “Ten zero to Ireland!”
“What?” Harry yelled, looking wildly around through his Omnioculars. “But Levski’s got the Quaffle!”
“Harry, if you’re not going to watch at normal speed, you’re going to miss things!” shouted Hermione, who was dancing up and
down, waving her arms in the air while Troy did a lap of honor
around the field. Harry looked quickly over the top of his Omnioculars and saw that the leprechauns watching from the sidelines
had all risen into the air again and formed the great, glittering
shamrock. Across the field, the veela were watching them sulkily.
Furious with himself, Harry spun his speed dial back to normal
as play resumed.
Harry knew enough about Quidditch to see that the Irish
Chasers were superb. They worked as a seamless team, their movements so well coordinated that they appeared to be reading one
another’s minds as they positioned themselves, and the rosette
on Harry’s chest kept squeaking their names: “Troy — Mullet —
Moran!” And within ten minutes, Ireland had scored twice more,
bringing their lead to thirty-zero and causing a thunderous tide of
roars and applause from the green-clad supporters.
The match became still faster, but more brutal. Volkov and
Vulchanov, the Bulgarian Beaters, were whacking the Bludgers as
fiercely as possible at the Irish Chasers, and were starting to prevent


107



CHAPTER EIGHT
them from using some of their best moves; twice they were forced
to scatter, and then, finally, Ivanova managed to break through
their ranks; dodge the Keeper, Ryan; and score Bulgaria’s first goal.
“Fingers in your ears!” bellowed Mr. Weasley as the veela started
to dance in celebration. Harry screwed up his eyes too; he wanted
to keep his mind on the game. After a few seconds, he chanced a
glance at the field. The veela had stopped dancing, and Bulgaria
was again in possession of the Quaffle.
“Dimitrov! Levski! Dimitrov! Ivanova — oh I say!” roared
Bagman.
One hundred thousand wizards gasped as the two Seekers,
Krum and Lynch, plummeted through the center of the Chasers,
so fast that it looked as though they had just jumped from airplanes
without parachutes. Harry followed their descent through his Omnioculars, squinting to see where the Snitch was —
“They’re going to crash!” screamed Hermione next to Harry.
She was half right — at the very last second, Viktor Krum
pulled out of the dive and spiraled off. Lynch, however, hit the
ground with a dull thud that could be heard throughout the stadium. A huge groan rose from the Irish seats.
“Fool!” moaned Mr. Weasley. “Krum was feinting!”
“It’s time-out!” yelled Bagman’s voice, “as trained mediwizards
hurry onto the field to examine Aidan Lynch!”
“He’ll be okay, he only got ploughed!” Charlie said reassuringly
to Ginny, who was hanging over the side of the box, looking
horror-struck. “Which is what Krum was after, of course. . . .”
Harry hastily pressed the replay and play-by-play buttons on his
Omnioculars, twiddled the speed dial, and put them back up to his
eyes.


He watched as Krum and Lynch dived again in slow motion.
W R O N S K I D E F E N S I V E F E I N T — D A N G E R O U S S E E K E R D I V E R S I O N read
the shining purple lettering across his lenses. He saw Krum’s face
contorted with concentration as he pulled out of the dive just
in time, while Lynch was flattened, and he understood — Krum
hadn’t seen the Snitch at all, he was just making Lynch copy him.
Harry had never seen anyone fly like that; Krum hardly looked as
though he was using a broomstick at all; he moved so easily
through the air that he looked unsupported and weightless. Harry
turned his Omnioculars back to normal and focused them on
Krum. He was now circling high above Lynch, who was being revived by mediwizards with cups of potion. Harry, focusing still
more closely upon Krum’s face, saw his dark eyes darting all over
the ground a hundred feet below. He was using the time while
Lynch was revived to look for the Snitch without interference.
Lynch got to his feet at last, to loud cheers from the green-clad
supporters, mounted his Firebolt, and kicked back off into the air.
His revival seemed to give Ireland new heart. When Mostafa blew
his whistle again, the Chasers moved into action with a skill unrivaled by anything Harry had seen so far.
After fifteen more fast and furious minutes, Ireland had pulled
ahead by ten more goals. They were now leading by one hundred
and thirty points to ten, and the game was starting to get dirtier.
As Mullet shot toward the goal posts yet again, clutching the
Quaffle tightly under her arm, the Bulgarian Keeper, Zograf, flew
out to meet her. Whatever happened was over so quickly Harry
didn’t catch it, but a scream of rage from the Irish crowd, and
Mostafa’s long, shrill whistle blast, told him it had been a foul.
“And Mostafa takes the Bulgarian Keeper to task for cobbing —


109

CHAPTER EIGHT
excessive use of elbows!” Bagman informed the roaring spectators.
“And — yes, it’s a penalty to Ireland!”
The leprechauns, who had risen angrily into the air like a swarm
of glittering hornets when Mullet had been fouled, now darted together to form the words “HA, HA, HA!” The veela on the other
side of the field leapt to their feet, tossed their hair angrily, and
started to dance again.
As one, the Weasley boys and Harry stuffed their fingers into
their ears, but Hermione, who hadn’t bothered, was soon tugging
on Harry’s arm. He turned to look at her, and she pulled his fingers
impatiently out of his ears.
“Look at the referee!” she said, giggling.
Harry looked down at the field. Hassan Mostafa had landed right
in front of the dancing veela, and was acting very oddly indeed. He
was flexing his muscles and smoothing his mustache excitedly.
“Now, we can’t have that!” said Ludo Bagman, though he
sounded highly amused. “Somebody slap the referee!”
A mediwizard came tearing across the field, his fingers stuffed
into his own ears, and kicked Mostafa hard in the shins. Mostafa
seemed to come to himself; Harry, watching through the Omnioculars again, saw that he looked exceptionally embarrassed and
had started shouting at the veela, who had stopped dancing and
were looking mutinous.
“And unless I’m much mistaken, Mostafa is actually attempting
to send off the Bulgarian team mascots!” said Bagman’s voice.
“Now there’s something we haven’t seen before. . . . Oh this could
turn nasty. . . .”
It did: The Bulgarian Beaters, Volkov and Vulchanov, landed on
either side of Mostafa and began arguing furiously with him,


110



THE QUIDDITCH
WORLD CUP
gesticulating toward the leprechauns, who had now gleefully
formed the words “HEE, HEE, HEE.” Mostafa was not impressed
by the Bulgarians’ arguments, however; he was jabbing his finger
into the air, clearly telling them to get flying again, and when they
refused, he gave two short blasts on his whistle.
“Two penalties for Ireland!” shouted Bagman, and the Bulgarian
crowd howled with anger. “And Volkov and Vulchanov had better
get back on those brooms . . . yes . . . there they go . . . and Troy
takes the Quaffle . . .”
Play now reached a level of ferocity beyond anything they had
yet seen. The Beaters on both sides were acting without mercy:
Volkov and Vulchanov in particular seemed not to care whether
their clubs made contact with Bludger or human as they swung
them violently through the air. Dimitrov shot straight at Moran,
who had the Quaffle, nearly knocking her off her broom.
“Foul !” roared the Irish supporters as one, all standing up in a
great wave of green.
“Foul!” echoed Ludo Bagman’s magically magnified voice.
“Dimitrov skins Moran — deliberately flying to collide there —
and it’s got to be another penalty — yes, there’s the whistle!”
The leprechauns had risen into the air again, and this time, they
formed a giant hand, which was making a very rude sign indeed at
the veela across the field. At this, the veela lost control. Instead of
dancing, they launched themselves across the field and began
throwing what seemed to be handfuls of fire at the leprechauns.
Watching through his Omnioculars, Harry saw that they didn’t
look remotely beautiful now. On the contrary, their faces were
elongating into sharp, cruel-beaked bird heads, and long, scaly
wings were bursting from their shoulders —


111

CHAPTER EIGHT
“And that, boys,” yelled Mr. Weasley over the tumult of the
crowd below, “is why you should never go for looks alone!”
Ministry wizards were flooding onto the field to separate the
veela and the leprechauns, but with little success; meanwhile, the
pitched battle below was nothing to the one taking place above.
Harry turned this way and that, staring through his Omnioculars,
as the Quaffle changed hands with the speed of a bullet.
“Levski — Dimitrov — Moran — Troy — Mullet — Ivanova —
Moran again — Moran — MORAN SCORES!”
But the cheers of the Irish supporters were barely heard over the
shrieks of the veela, the blasts now issuing from the Ministry members’ wands, and the furious roars of the Bulgarians. The game
recommenced immediately; now Levski had the Quaffle, now
Dimitrov —
The Irish Beater Quigley swung heavily at a passing Bludger,
and hit it as hard as possible toward Krum, who did not duck
quickly enough. It hit him full in the face.
There was a deafening groan from the crowd; Krum’s nose
looked broken, there was blood everywhere, but Hassan Mostafa
didn’t blow his whistle. He had become distracted, and Harry
couldn’t blame him; one of the veela had thrown a handful of fire
and set his broom tail alight.
Harry wanted someone to realize that Krum was injured; even
though he was supporting Ireland, Krum was the most exciting
player on the field. Ron obviously felt the same.
“Time-out! Ah, come on, he can’t play like that, look at him —”
“Look at Lynch!” Harry yelled.
For the Irish Seeker had suddenly gone into a dive, and Harry


112



THE QUIDDITCH
WORLD CUP
was quite sure that this was no Wronski Feint; this was the real
thing. . . .
“He’s seen the Snitch!” Harry shouted. “He’s seen it! Look at
him go!”
Half the crowd seemed to have realized what was happening; the
Irish supporters rose in another great wave of green, screaming
their Seeker on . . . but Krum was on his tail. How he could see
where he was going, Harry had no idea; there were flecks of blood
flying through the air behind him, but he was drawing level with
Lynch now as the pair of them hurtled toward the ground again —
“They’re going to crash!” shrieked Hermione.
“They’re not!” roared Ron.
“Lynch is!” yelled Harry.
And he was right — for the second time, Lynch hit the ground
with tremendous force and was immediately stampeded by a horde
of angry veela.
“The Snitch, where’s the Snitch?” bellowed Charlie, along the
row.
“He’s got it — Krum’s got it — it’s all over!” shouted Harry.
Krum, his red robes shining with blood from his nose, was rising gently into the air, his fist held high, a glint of gold in his hand.
The scoreboard was flashing BULGARIA: 160, IRELAND: 170
across the crowd, who didn’t seem to have realized what had happened. Then, slowly, as though a great jumbo jet were revving up,
the rumbling from the Ireland supporters grew louder and louder
and erupted into screams of delight.
“IRELAND WINS!” Bagman shouted, who like the Irish,
seemed to be taken aback by the sudden end of the match.

CHAPTER EIGHT
“KRUM GETS THE SNITCH — BUT IRELAND WINS —
good lord, I don’t think any of us were expecting that!”
“What did he catch the Snitch for?” Ron bellowed, even as he
jumped up and down, applauding with his hands over his head.
“He ended it when Ireland were a hundred and sixty points ahead,
the idiot!”
“He knew they were never going to catch up!” Harry shouted
back over all the noise, also applauding loudly. “The Irish Chasers
were too good. . . . He wanted to end it on his terms, that’s all. . . .”
“He was very brave, wasn’t he?” Hermione said, leaning forward
to watch Krum land as a swarm of mediwizards blasted a path
through the battling leprechauns and veela to get to him. “He
looks a terrible mess. . . .”
Harry put his Omnioculars to his eyes again. It was hard to see
what was happening below, because leprechauns were zooming delightedly all over the field, but he could just make out Krum, surrounded by mediwizards. He looked surlier than ever and refused
to let them mop him up. His team members were around him,
shaking their heads and looking dejected; a short way away, the
Irish players were dancing gleefully in a shower of gold descending
from their mascots. Flags were waving all over the stadium, the
Irish national anthem blared from all sides; the veela were shrinking back into their usual, beautiful selves now, though looking
dispirited and forlorn.
“Vell, ve fought bravely,” said a gloomy voice behind Harry. He
looked around; it was the Bulgarian Minister of Magic.
“You can speak English!” said Fudge, sounding outraged. “And
you’ve been letting me mime everything all day!”


THE QUIDDITCH
WORLD CUP
“Vell, it vos very funny,” said the Bulgarian minister, shrugging.
“And as the Irish team performs a lap of honor, flanked by their
mascots, the Quidditch World Cup itself is brought into the Top
Box!” roared Bagman.
Harry’s eyes were suddenly dazzled by a blinding white light, as
the Top Box was magically illuminated so that everyone in the
stands could see the inside. Squinting toward the entrance, he saw
two panting wizards carrying a vast golden cup into the box, which
they handed to Cornelius Fudge, who was still looking very disgruntled that he’d been using sign language all day for nothing.
“Let’s have a really loud hand for the gallant losers — Bulgaria!”
Bagman shouted.
And up the stairs into the box came the seven defeated Bulgarian
players. The crowd below was applauding appreciatively; Harry
could see thousands and thousands of Omniocular lenses flashing
and winking in their direction.
One by one, the Bulgarians filed between the rows of seats in the
box, and Bagman called out the name of each as they shook hands
with their own minister and then with Fudge. Krum, who was last
in line, looked a real mess. Two black eyes were blooming spectacularly on his bloody face. He was still holding the Snitch. Harry
noticed that he seemed much less coordinated on the ground. He
was slightly duck-footed and distinctly round-shouldered. But
when Krum’s name was announced, the whole stadium gave him a
resounding, earsplitting roar.
And then came the Irish team. Aidan Lynch was being supported by Moran and Connolly; the second crash seemed to have
dazed him and his eyes looked strangely unfocused. But he grinned


115



CHAPTER EIGHT
happily as Troy and Quigley lifted the Cup into the air and the
crowd below thundered its approval. Harry’s hands were numb
with clapping.
At last, when the Irish team had left the box to perform another
lap of honor on their brooms (Aidan Lynch on the back of Connolly’s, clutching hard around his waist and still grinning in a bemused sort of way), Bagman pointed his wand at his throat and
muttered, “Quietus.”
“They’ll be talking about this one for years,” he said hoarsely,
“a really unexpected twist, that. . . . shame it couldn’t have lasted
longer. . . . Ah yes. . . . yes, I owe you . . . how much?”
For Fred and George had just scrambled over the backs of their
seats and were standing in front of Ludo Bagman with broad grins
on their faces, their hands outstretched.

THE DARK MARK

D

on’t tell your mother you’ve been gambling,” Mr. Weasley
implored Fred and George as they all made their way slowly
down the purple-carpeted stairs.
“Don’t worry, Dad,” said Fred gleefully, “we’ve got big plans for
this money. We don’t want it confiscated.”
Mr. Weasley looked for a moment as though he was going to ask
what these big plans were, but seemed to decide, upon reflection,
that he didn’t want to know.
They were soon caught up in the crowds now flooding out of the
stadium and back to their campsites. Raucous singing was borne
toward them on the night air as they retraced their steps along the
lantern-lit path, and leprechauns kept shooting over their heads,
cackling and waving their lanterns. When they finally reached the
tents, nobody felt like sleeping at all, and given the level of noise
around them, Mr. Weasley agreed that they could all have one last
cup of cocoa together before turning in. They were soon arguing


117



CHAPTER NINE
enjoyably about the match; Mr. Weasley got drawn into a disagreement about cobbing with Charlie, and it was only when Ginny fell
asleep right at the tiny table and spilled hot chocolate all over the
floor that Mr. Weasley called a halt to the verbal replays and insisted that everyone go to bed. Hermione and Ginny went into the
next tent, and Harry and the rest of the Weasleys changed into pajamas and clambered into their bunks. From the other side of the
campsite they could still hear much singing and the odd echoing
bang.
“Oh I am glad I’m not on duty,” muttered Mr. Weasley sleepily.
“I wouldn’t fancy having to go and tell the Irish they’ve got to stop
celebrating.”
Harry, who was on a top bunk above Ron, lay staring up at the
canvas ceiling of the tent, watching the glow of an occasional leprechaun lantern flying overhead, and picturing again some of
Krum’s more spectacular moves. He was itching to get back on his
own Firebolt and try out the Wronski Feint. . . . Somehow Oliver
Wood had never managed to convey with all his wriggling diagrams what that move was supposed to look like. . . . Harry saw
himself in robes that had his name on the back, and imagined the
sensation of hearing a hundred-thousand-strong crowd roar, as
Ludo Bagman’s voice echoed throughout the stadium, “I give
you . . . Potter!”
Harry never knew whether or not he had actually dropped off to
sleep — his fantasies of flying like Krum might well have slipped
into actual dreams — all he knew was that, quite suddenly, Mr.
Weasley was shouting.
“Get up! Ron — Harry — come on now, get up, this is urgent!”


118



THE DARK MARK
Harry sat up quickly and the top of his head hit canvas.
“ ’S’ matter?” he said.
Dimly, he could tell that something was wrong. The noises in
the campsite had changed. The singing had stopped. He could hear
screams, and the sound of people running. He slipped down from
the bunk and reached for his clothes, but Mr. Weasley, who had
pulled on his jeans over his own pajamas, said, “No time, Harry —
just grab a jacket and get outside — quickly!”
Harry did as he was told and hurried out of the tent, Ron at his
heels.
By the light of the few fires that were still burning, he could see
people running away into the woods, fleeing something that was
moving across the field toward them, something that was emitting
odd flashes of light and noises like gunfire. Loud jeering, roars of
laughter, and drunken yells were drifting toward them; then came
a burst of strong green light, which illuminated the scene.
A crowd of wizards, tightly packed and moving together with
wands pointing straight upward, was marching slowly across the
field. Harry squinted at them. . . . They didn’t seem to have
faces. . . . Then he realized that their heads were hooded and their
faces masked. High above them, floating along in midair, four
struggling figures were being contorted into grotesque shapes. It
was as though the masked wizards on the ground were puppeteers,
and the people above them were marionettes operated by invisible
strings that rose from the wands into the air. Two of the figures
were very small.
More wizards were joining the marching group, laughing and
pointing up at the floating bodies. Tents crumpled and fell as the


119



CHAPTER NINE
marching crowd swelled. Once or twice Harry saw one of the
marchers blast a tent out of his way with his wand. Several caught
fire. The screaming grew louder.
The floating people were suddenly illuminated as they passed
over a burning tent and Harry recognized one of them: Mr.
Roberts, the campsite manager. The other three looked as though
they might be his wife and children. One of the marchers below
flipped Mrs. Roberts upside down with his wand; her nightdress
fell down to reveal voluminous drawers and she struggled to cover
herself up as the crowd below her screeched and hooted with glee.
“That’s sick,” Ron muttered, watching the smallest Muggle
child, who had begun to spin like a top, sixty feet above the
ground, his head flopping limply from side to side. “That is really
sick. . . .”
Hermione and Ginny came hurrying toward them, pulling coats
over their nightdresses, with Mr. Weasley right behind them. At
the same moment, Bill, Charlie, and Percy emerged from the boys’
tent, fully dressed, with their sleeves rolled up and their wands out.
“We’re going to help the Ministry!” Mr. Weasley shouted over all
the noise, rolling up his own sleeves. “You lot — get into the
woods, and stick together. I’ll come and fetch you when we’ve sorted
this out!”
Bill, Charlie, and Percy were already sprinting away toward the
oncoming marchers; Mr. Weasley tore after them. Ministry wizards
were dashing from every direction toward the source of the trouble.
The crowd beneath the Roberts family was coming ever closer.
“C’mon,” said Fred, grabbing Ginny’s hand and starting to pull
her toward the wood. Harry, Ron, Hermione, and George followed. They all looked back as they reached the trees. The crowd


120



THE DARK MARK
beneath the Roberts family was larger than ever; they could see the
Ministry wizards trying to get through it to the hooded wizards in
the center, but they were having great difficulty. It looked as
though they were scared to perform any spell that might make the
Roberts family fall.
The colored lanterns that had lit the path to the stadium had
been extinguished. Dark figures were blundering through the trees;
children were crying; anxious shouts and panicked voices were reverberating around them in the cold night air. Harry felt himself
being pushed hither and thither by people whose faces he could
not see. Then he heard Ron yell with pain.
“What happened?” said Hermione anxiously, stopping so
abruptly that Harry walked into her. “Ron, where are you? Oh this
is stupid — lumos!”
She illuminated her wand and directed its narrow beam across
the path. Ron was lying sprawled on the ground.
“Tripped over a tree root,” he said angrily, getting to his feet
again.
“Well, with feet that size, hard not to,” said a drawling voice
from behind them.
Harry, Ron, and Hermione turned sharply. Draco Malfoy was
standing alone nearby, leaning against a tree, looking utterly relaxed. His arms folded, he seemed to have been watching the scene
at the campsite through a gap in the trees.
Ron told Malfoy to do something that Harry knew he would
never have dared say in front of Mrs. Weasley
“Language, Weasley,” said Malfoy, his pale eyes glittering. “Hadn’t you better be hurrying along, now? You wouldn’t like her spotted, would you?”


121



CHAPTER NINE
He nodded at Hermione, and at the same moment, a blast like a
bomb sounded from the campsite, and a flash of green light momentarily lit the trees around them.
“What’s that supposed to mean?” said Hermione defiantly.
“Granger, they’re after Muggles,” said Malfoy. “D’you want to be
showing off your knickers in midair? Because if you do, hang
around . . . they’re moving this way, and it would give us all a laugh.”
“Hermione’s a witch,” Harry snarled.
“Have it your own way, Potter,” said Malfoy, grinning maliciously. “If you think they can’t spot a Mudblood, stay where you
are.”
“You watch your mouth!” shouted Ron. Everybody present
knew that “Mudblood” was a very offensive term for a witch or
wizard of Muggle parentage.
“Never mind, Ron,” said Hermione quickly, seizing Ron’s arm
to restrain him as he took a step toward Malfoy.
There came a bang from the other side of the trees that was
louder than anything they had heard. Several people nearby
screamed. Malfoy chuckled softly.
“Scare easily, don’t they?” he said lazily. “I suppose your daddy
told you all to hide? What’s he up to — trying to rescue the
Muggles?”
“Where’re your parents?” said Harry, his temper rising. “Out
there wearing masks, are they?”
Malfoy turned his face to Harry, still smiling.
“Well . . . if they were, I wouldn’t be likely to tell you, would I,
Potter?”
“Oh come on,” said Hermione, with a disgusted look at Malfoy,
“let’s go and find the others.”


122



THE DARK MARK
“Keep that big bushy head down, Granger,” sneered Malfoy.
“Come on,” Hermione repeated, and she pulled Harry and Ron
up the path again.
“I’ll bet you anything his dad is one of that masked lot!” said
Ron hotly.
“Well, with any luck, the Ministry will catch him!” said Hermione fervently. “Oh I can’t believe this. Where have the others
got to?”
Fred, George, and Ginny were nowhere to be seen, though the
path was packed with plenty of other people, all looking nervously
over their shoulders toward the commotion back at the campsite. A
huddle of teenagers in pajamas was arguing vociferously a little way
along the path. When they saw Harry, Ron, and Hermione, a girl
with thick curly hair turned and said quickly, “Où est Madame
Maxime? Nous l’avons perdue —”
“Er — what?” said Ron.
“Oh . . .” The girl who had spoken turned her back on him, and
as they walked on they distinctly heard her say, “ ’Ogwarts.”
“Beauxbatons,” muttered Hermione.
“Sorry?” said Harry.
“They must go to Beauxbatons,” said Hermione. “You know . . .
Beauxbatons Academy of Magic . . . I read about it in An Appraisal
of Magical Education in Europe.”
“Oh . . . yeah . . . right,” said Harry.
“Fred and George can’t have gone that far,” said Ron, pulling out
his wand, lighting it like Hermione’s, and squinting up the path.
Harry dug in the pockets of his jacket for his own wand — but it
wasn’t there. The only thing he could find was his Omnioculars.
“Ah, no, I don’t believe it . . . I’ve lost my wand!”


123



CHAPTER NINE
“You’re kidding!”
Ron and Hermione raised their wands high enough to spread the
narrow beams of light farther on the ground; Harry looked all
around him, but his wand was nowhere to be seen.
“Maybe it’s back in the tent,” said Ron.
“Maybe it fell out of your pocket when we were running?”
Hermione suggested anxiously.
“Yeah,” said Harry, “maybe . . .”
He usually kept his wand with him at all times in the wizarding
world, and finding himself without it in the midst of a scene like
this made him feel very vulnerable.
A rustling noise nearby made all three of them jump. Winky the
house-elf was fighting her way out of a clump of bushes nearby. She
was moving in a most peculiar fashion, apparently with great difficulty; it was as though someone invisible were trying to hold her
back.
“There is bad wizards about!” she squeaked distractedly as she
leaned forward and labored to keep running. “People high — high
in the air! Winky is getting out of the way!”
And she disappeared into the trees on the other side of the path,
panting and squeaking as she fought the force that was restraining
her.
“What’s up with her?” said Ron, looking curiously after Winky.
“Why can’t she run properly?”
“Bet she didn’t ask permission to hide,” said Harry. He was
thinking of Dobby: Every time he had tried to do something the
Malfoys wouldn’t like, the house-elf had been forced to start beating himself up.


124



THE DARK MARK
“You know, house-elves get a very raw deal!” said Hermione indignantly. “It’s slavery, that’s what it is! That Mr. Crouch made her
go up to the top of the stadium, and she was terrified, and he’s got
her bewitched so she can’t even run when they start trampling
tents! Why doesn’t anyone do something about it?”
“Well, the elves are happy, aren’t they?” Ron said. “You heard old
Winky back at the match . . . ‘House-elves is not supposed to have
fun’ . . . that’s what she likes, being bossed around. . . .”
“It’s people like you, Ron,” Hermione began hotly, “who prop up
rotten and unjust systems, just because they’re too lazy to —”
Another loud bang echoed from the edge of the wood.
“Let’s just keep moving, shall we?” said Ron, and Harry saw him
glance edgily at Hermione. Perhaps there was truth in what Malfoy
had said; perhaps Hermione was in more danger than they were.
They set off again, Harry still searching his pockets, even though
he knew his wand wasn’t there.
They followed the dark path deeper into the wood, still keeping
an eye out for Fred, George, and Ginny. They passed a group of
goblins who were cackling over a sack of gold that they had undoubtedly won betting on the match, and who seemed quite
unperturbed by the trouble at the campsite. Farther still along the
path, they walked into a patch of silvery light, and when they
looked through the trees, they saw three tall and beautiful veela
standing in a clearing, surrounded by a gaggle of young wizards, all
of whom were talking very loudly.
“I pull down about a hundred sacks of Galleons a year!” one of
them shouted. “I’m a dragon killer for the Committee for the Disposal of Dangerous Creatures.”


125



CHAPTER NINE
“No, you’re not!” yelled his friend. “You’re a dishwasher at the
Leaky Cauldron. . . . but I’m a vampire hunter, I’ve killed about
ninety so far —”
A third young wizard, whose pimples were visible even by the
dim, silvery light of the veela, now cut in, “I’m about to become
the youngest ever Minister of Magic, I am.”
Harry snorted with laughter. He recognized the pimply wizard:
His name was Stan Shunpike, and he was in fact a conductor on
the triple-decker Knight Bus. He turned to tell Ron this, but
Ron’s face had gone oddly slack, and next second Ron was
yelling, “Did I tell you I’ve invented a broomstick that’ll reach
Jupiter?”
“Honestly!” said Hermione, and she and Harry grabbed Ron
firmly by the arms, wheeled him around, and marched him away.
By the time the sounds of the veela and their admirers had faded
completely, they were in the very heart of the wood. They seemed
to be alone now; everything was much quieter.
Harry looked around. “I reckon we can just wait here, you
know. We’ll hear anyone coming a mile off.”
The words were hardly out of his mouth, when Ludo Bagman
emerged from behind a tree right ahead of them.
Even by the feeble light of the two wands, Harry could see that
a great change had come over Bagman. He no longer looked buoyant and rosy-faced; there was no more spring in his step. He looked
very white and strained.
“Who’s that?” he said, blinking down at them, trying to make
out their faces. “What are you doing in here, all alone?”
They looked at one another, surprised.
“Well — there’s a sort of riot going on,” said Ron.


126



THE DARK MARK
Bagman stared at him.
“What?”
“At the campsite . . . some people have got hold of a family of
Muggles. . . .”
Bagman swore loudly.
“Damn them!” he said, looking quite distracted, and without
another word, he Disapparated with a small pop!
“Not exactly on top of things, Mr. Bagman, is he?” said
Hermione, frowning.
“He was a great Beater, though,” said Ron, leading the way off
the path into a small clearing, and sitting down on a patch of dry
grass at the foot of a tree. “The Wimbourne Wasps won the league
three times in a row while he was with them.”
He took his small figure of Krum out of his pocket, set it down
on the ground, and watched it walk around. Like the real Krum, the
model was slightly duck-footed and round-shouldered, much less
impressive on his splayed feet than on his broomstick. Harry was
listening for noise from the campsite. Everything seemed much
quieter; perhaps the riot was over.
“I hope the others are okay,” said Hermione after a while.
“They’ll be fine,” said Ron.
“Imagine if your dad catches Lucius Malfoy,” said Harry, sitting
down next to Ron and watching the small figure of Krum slouching over the fallen leaves. “He’s always said he’d like to get something on him.”
“That’d wipe the smirk off old Draco’s face, all right,” said Ron.
“Those poor Muggles, though,” said Hermione nervously.
“What if they can’t get them down?”
“They will,” said Ron reassuringly. “They’ll find a way.”


127



CHAPTER NINE
“Mad, though, to do something like that when the whole Ministry of Magic’s out here tonight!” said Hermione. “I mean, how do
they expect to get away with it? Do you think they’ve been drinking, or are they just —”
But she broke off abruptly and looked over her shoulder. Harry
and Ron looked quickly around too. It sounded as though someone was staggering toward their clearing. They waited, listening to
the sounds of the uneven steps behind the dark trees. But the footsteps came to a sudden halt.
“Hello?” called Harry.
There was silence. Harry got to his feet and peered around the
tree. It was too dark to see very far, but he could sense somebody
standing just beyond the range of his vision.
“Who’s there?” he said.
And then, without warning, the silence was rent by a voice unlike any they had heard in the wood; and it uttered, not a panicked
shout, but what sounded like a spell.
“MORSMORDRE !”
And something vast, green, and glittering erupted from the
patch of darkness Harry’s eyes had been struggling to penetrate; it
flew up over the treetops and into the sky.
“What the — ?” gasped Ron as he sprang to his feet again, staring up at the thing that had appeared.
For a split second, Harry thought it was another leprechaun formation. Then he realized that it was a colossal skull, comprised of
what looked like emerald stars, with a serpent protruding from its
mouth like a tongue. As they watched, it rose higher and higher,
blazing in a haze of greenish smoke, etched against the black sky
like a new constellation.


128



THE DARK MARK
Suddenly, the wood all around them erupted with screams.
Harry didn’t understand why, but the only possible cause was the
sudden appearance of the skull, which had now risen high enough
to illuminate the entire wood like some grisly neon sign. He
scanned the darkness for the person who had conjured the skull,
but he couldn’t see anyone.
“Who’s there?” he called again.
“Harry, come on, move!” Hermione had seized the collar of his
jacket and was tugging him backward.
“What’s the matter?” Harry said, startled to see her face so white
and terrified.
“It’s the Dark Mark, Harry!” Hermione moaned, pulling him as
hard as she could. “You-Know-Who’s sign!”
“Voldemort’s — ?”
“Harry, come on!”
Harry turned — Ron was hurriedly scooping up his miniature
Krum — the three of them started across the clearing — but before they had taken a few hurried steps, a series of popping noises
announced the arrival of twenty wizards, appearing from thin air,
surrounding them.
Harry whirled around, and in an instant, he registered one fact:
Each of these wizards had his wand out, and every wand was pointing right at himself, Ron, and Hermione.
Without pausing to think, he yelled, “DUCK!”
He seized the other two and pulled them down onto the ground.
“STUPEFY !” roared twenty voices — there was a blinding series
of flashes and Harry felt the hair on his head ripple as though a
powerful wind had swept the clearing. Raising his head a fraction
of an inch he saw jets of fiery red light flying over them from the


129



CHAPTER NINE
wizards’ wands, crossing one another, bouncing off tree trunks, rebounding into the darkness —
“Stop!” yelled a voice he recognized. “STOP! That’s my son!”
Harry’s hair stopped blowing about. He raised his head a little
higher. The wizard in front of him had lowered his wand. He rolled
over and saw Mr. Weasley striding toward them, looking terrified.
“Ron — Harry” — his voice sounded shaky — “Hermione —
are you all right?”
“Out of the way, Arthur,” said a cold, curt voice.
It was Mr. Crouch. He and the other Ministry wizards were closing in on them. Harry got to his feet to face them. Mr. Crouch’s
face was taut with rage.
“Which of you did it?” he snapped, his sharp eyes darting between them. “Which of you conjured the Dark Mark?”
“We didn’t do that!” said Harry, gesturing up at the skull.
“We didn’t do anything!” said Ron, who was rubbing his elbow
and looking indignantly at his father. “What did you want to attack us for?”
“Do not lie, sir!” shouted Mr. Crouch. His wand was still pointing directly at Ron, and his eyes were popping — he looked
slightly mad. “You have been discovered at the scene of the crime!”
“Barty,” whispered a witch in a long woolen dressing gown,
“they’re kids, Barty, they’d never have been able to —”
“Where did the Mark come from, you three?” said Mr. Weasley
quickly.
“Over there,” said Hermione shakily, pointing at the place
where they had heard the voice. “There was someone behind the
trees . . . they shouted words — an incantation —”


130



THE DARK MARK
“Oh, stood over there, did they?” said Mr. Crouch, turning his
popping eyes on Hermione now, disbelief etched all over his face.
“Said an incantation, did they? You seem very well informed about
how that Mark is summoned, missy —”
But none of the Ministry wizards apart from Mr. Crouch
seemed to think it remotely likely that Harry, Ron, or Hermione
had conjured the skull; on the contrary, at Hermione’s words, they
had all raised their wands again and were pointing in the direction
she had indicated, squinting through the dark trees.
“We’re too late,” said the witch in the woolen dressing gown,
shaking her head. “They’ll have Disapparated.”
“I don’t think so,” said a wizard with a scrubby brown beard.
It was Amos Diggory, Cedric’s father. “Our Stunners went right
through those trees. . . . There’s a good chance we got them. . . .”
“Amos, be careful!” said a few of the wizards warningly as Mr.
Diggory squared his shoulders, raised his wand, marched across the
clearing, and disappeared into the darkness. Hermione watched
him vanish with her hands over her mouth.
A few seconds later, they heard Mr. Diggory shout.
“Yes! We got them! There’s someone here! Unconscious! It’s —
but — blimey . . .”
“You’ve got someone?” shouted Mr. Crouch, sounding highly
disbelieving. “Who? Who is it?”
They heard snapping twigs, the rustling of leaves, and then
crunching footsteps as Mr. Diggory reemerged from behind the
trees. He was carrying a tiny, limp figure in his arms. Harry recognized the tea towel at once. It was Winky.
Mr. Crouch did not move or speak as Mr. Diggory deposited his


131



CHAPTER NINE
elf on the ground at his feet. The other Ministry wizards were all
staring at Mr. Crouch. For a few seconds Crouch remained transfixed, his eyes blazing in his white face as he stared down at Winky.
Then he appeared to come to life again.
“This — cannot — be,” he said jerkily. “No —”
He moved quickly around Mr. Diggory and strode off toward
the place where he had found Winky.
“No point, Mr. Crouch,” Mr. Diggory called after him. “There’s
no one else there.”
But Mr. Crouch did not seem prepared to take his word for it.
They could hear him moving around and the rustling of leaves as
he pushed the bushes aside, searching.
“Bit embarrassing,” Mr. Diggory said grimly, looking down at
Winky’s unconscious form. “Barty Crouch’s house-elf . . . I mean
to say . . .”
“Come off it, Amos,” said Mr. Weasley quietly, “you don’t
seriously think it was the elf ? The Dark Mark’s a wizard’s sign. It
requires a wand.”
“Yeah,” said Mr. Diggory, “and she had a wand.”
“What?” said Mr. Weasley.
“Here, look.” Mr. Diggory held up a wand and showed it to Mr.
Weasley. “Had it in her hand. So that’s clause three of the Code of
Wand Use broken, for a start. No non-human creature is permitted
to carry or use a wand.”
Just then there was another pop, and Ludo Bagman Apparated
right next to Mr. Weasley. Looking breathless and disorientated,
he spun on the spot, goggling upward at the emerald-green
skull.


132



THE DARK MARK
“The Dark Mark!” he panted, almost trampling Winky as he
turned inquiringly to his colleagues. “Who did it? Did you get
them? Barty! What’s going on?”
Mr. Crouch had returned empty-handed. His face was still
ghostly white, and his hands and his toothbrush mustache were
both twitching.
“Where have you been, Barty?” said Bagman. “Why weren’t you
at the match? Your elf was saving you a seat too — gulping gargoyles!” Bagman had just noticed Winky lying at his feet. “What
happened to her?”
“I have been busy, Ludo,” said Mr. Crouch, still talking in the
same jerky fashion, barely moving his lips. “And my elf has been
stunned.”
“Stunned? By you lot, you mean? But why — ?”
Comprehension dawned suddenly on Bagman’s round, shiny
face; he looked up at the skull, down at Winky, and then at Mr.
Crouch.
“No!” he said. “Winky? Conjure the Dark Mark? She wouldn’t
know how! She’d need a wand, for a start!”
“And she had one,” said Mr. Diggory. “I found her holding one,
Ludo. If it’s all right with you, Mr. Crouch, I think we should hear
what she’s got to say for herself.”
Crouch gave no sign that he had heard Mr. Diggory, but Mr.
Diggory seemed to take his silence for assent. He raised his own
wand, pointed it at Winky, and said, “Rennervate!”
Winky stirred feebly. Her great brown eyes opened and she
blinked several times in a bemused sort of way. Watched by the
silent wizards, she raised herself shakily into a sitting position.


133

CHAPTER NINE
She caught sight of Mr. Diggory’s feet, and slowly, tremulously,
raised her eyes to stare up into his face; then, more slowly still, she
looked up into the sky. Harry could see the floating skull reflected
twice in her enormous, glassy eyes. She gave a gasp, looked wildly
around the crowded clearing, and burst into terrified sobs.
“Elf !” said Mr. Diggory sternly. “Do you know who I am? I’m a
member of the Department for the Regulation and Control of
Magical Creatures!”
Winky began to rock backward and forward on the ground, her
breath coming in sharp bursts. Harry was reminded forcibly of
Dobby in his moments of terrified disobedience.
“As you see, elf, the Dark Mark was conjured here a short while
ago,” said Mr. Diggory. “And you were discovered moments later,
right beneath it! An explanation, if you please!”
“I — I — I is not doing it, sir!” Winky gasped. “I is not knowing how, sir!”
“You were found with a wand in your hand!” barked Mr. Diggory, brandishing it in front of her. And as the wand caught the
green light that was filling the clearing from the skull above, Harry
recognized it.
“Hey — that’s mine!” he said.
Everyone in the clearing looked at him.
“Excuse me?” said Mr. Diggory, incredulously.
“That’s my wand!” said Harry. “I dropped it!”
“You dropped it?” repeated Mr. Diggory in disbelief. “Is this a
confession? You threw it aside after you conjured the Mark?”
“Amos, think who you’re talking to!” said Mr. Weasley, very angrily. “Is Harry Potter likely to conjure the Dark Mark?”


134



THE DARK MARK
“Er — of course not,” mumbled Mr. Diggory. “Sorry . . . carried away . . .”
“I didn’t drop it there, anyway,” said Harry, jerking his thumb
toward the trees beneath the skull. “I missed it right after we got
into the wood.”
“So,” said Mr. Diggory, his eyes hardening as he turned to look
at Winky again, cowering at his feet. “You found this wand, eh, elf ?
And you picked it up and thought you’d have some fun with it, did
you?”
“I is not doing magic with it, sir!” squealed Winky, tears streaming down the sides of her squashed and bulbous nose. “I is . . . I
is . . . I is just picking it up, sir! I is not making the Dark Mark, sir,
I is not knowing how!”
“It wasn’t her!” said Hermione. She looked very nervous, speaking up in front of all these Ministry wizards, yet determined all the
same. “Winky’s got a squeaky little voice, and the voice we heard
doing the incantation was much deeper!” She looked around at
Harry and Ron, appealing for their support. “It didn’t sound anything like Winky, did it?”
“No,” said Harry, shaking his head. “It definitely didn’t sound
like an elf.”
“Yeah, it was a human voice,” said Ron.
“Well, we’ll soon see,” growled Mr. Diggory, looking unimpressed. “There’s a simple way of discovering the last spell a wand
performed, elf, did you know that?”
Winky trembled and shook her head frantically, her ears flapping, as Mr. Diggory raised his own wand again and placed it tip to
tip with Harry’s.


135

CHAPTER NINE
“Prior Incantato!” roared Mr. Diggory.
Harry heard Hermione gasp, horrified, as a gigantic serpenttongued skull erupted from the point where the two wands met, but
it was a mere shadow of the green skull high above them; it looked
as though it were made of thick gray smoke: the ghost of a spell.
“Deletrius!” Mr. Diggory shouted, and the smoky skull vanished
in a wisp of smoke.
“So,” said Mr. Diggory with a kind of savage triumph, looking
down upon Winky, who was still shaking convulsively.
“I is not doing it!” she squealed, her eyes rolling in terror. “I is
not, I is not, I is not knowing how! I is a good elf, I isn’t using
wands, I isn’t knowing how!”
“You’ve been caught red-handed, elf !” Mr. Diggory roared.
“Caught with the guilty wand in your hand !”
“Amos,” said Mr. Weasley loudly, “think about it . . . precious
few wizards know how to do that spell. . . . Where would she have
learned it?”
“Perhaps Amos is suggesting,” said Mr. Crouch, cold anger in
every syllable, “that I routinely teach my servants to conjure the
Dark Mark?”
There was a deeply unpleasant silence. Amos Diggory looked
horrified. “Mr. Crouch . . . not . . . not at all . . .”
“You have now come very close to accusing the two people in this
clearing who are least likely to conjure that Mark!” barked Mr.
Crouch. “Harry Potter — and myself ! I suppose you are familiar
with the boy’s story, Amos?”
“Of course — everyone knows —” muttered Mr. Diggory, looking highly discomforted.
“And I trust you remember the many proofs I have given, over a


136



THE DARK MARK
long career, that I despise and detest the Dark Arts and those who
practice them?” Mr. Crouch shouted, his eyes bulging again.
“Mr. Crouch, I — I never suggested you had anything to do
with it!” Amos Diggory muttered again, now reddening behind his
scrubby brown beard.
“If you accuse my elf, you accuse me, Diggory!” shouted Mr.
Crouch. “Where else would she have learned to conjure it?”
“She — she might’ve picked it up anywhere —”
“Precisely, Amos,” said Mr. Weasley. “She might have picked it up
anywhere. . . . Winky?” he said kindly, turning to the elf, but she
flinched as though he too was shouting at her. “Where exactly did
you find Harry’s wand?”
Winky was twisting the hem of her tea towel so violently that it
was fraying beneath her fingers.
“I — I is finding it . . . finding it there, sir. . . .” she whispered,
“there . . . in the trees, sir. . . .”
“You see, Amos?” said Mr. Weasley. “Whoever conjured the
Mark could have Disapparated right after they’d done it, leaving
Harry’s wand behind. A clever thing to do, not using their own
wand, which could have betrayed them. And Winky here had
the misfortune to come across the wand moments later and pick
it up.
“But then, she’d have been only a few feet away from the real
culprit!” said Mr. Diggory impatiently. “Elf ? Did you see anyone?”
Winky began to tremble worse than ever. Her giant eyes flickered from Mr. Diggory, to Ludo Bagman, and onto Mr. Crouch.
Then she gulped and said, “I is seeing no one, sir . . . no one . . .”
“Amos,” said Mr. Crouch curtly, “I am fully aware that, in the
ordinary course of events, you would want to take Winky into your


137



CHAPTER NINE
department for questioning. I ask you, however, to allow me to
deal with her.”
Mr. Diggory looked as though he didn’t think much of this suggestion at all, but it was clear to Harry that Mr. Crouch was such
an important member of the Ministry that he did not dare refuse
him.
“You may rest assured that she will be punished,” Mr. Crouch
added coldly.
“M-m-master . . .” Winky stammered, looking up at Mr. Crouch,
her eyes brimming with tears. “M-m-master, p-p-please . . .”
Mr. Crouch stared back, his face somehow sharpened, each line
upon it more deeply etched. There was no pity in his gaze.
“Winky has behaved tonight in a manner I would not have believed possible,” he said slowly. “I told her to remain in the tent. I
told her to stay there while I went to sort out the trouble. And I
find that she disobeyed me. This means clothes.”
“No!” shrieked Winky, prostrating herself at Mr. Crouch’s feet.
“No, master! Not clothes, not clothes!”
Harry knew that the only way to turn a house-elf free was to present it with proper garments. It was pitiful to see the way Winky
clutched at her tea towel as she sobbed over Mr. Crouch’s feet.
“But she was frightened!” Hermione burst out angrily, glaring at
Mr. Crouch. “Your elf ’s scared of heights, and those wizards in
masks were levitating people! You can’t blame her for wanting to
get out of their way!”
Mr. Crouch took a step backward, freeing himself from contact
with the elf, whom he was surveying as though she were something
filthy and rotten that was contaminating his over-shined shoes.
“I have no use for a house-elf who disobeys me,” he said coldly,


138



THE DARK MARK
looking over at Hermione. “I have no use for a servant who forgets
what is due to her master, and to her master’s reputation.”
Winky was crying so hard that her sobs echoed around the clearing. There was a very nasty silence, which was ended by Mr.
Weasley, who said quietly, “Well, I think I’ll take my lot back to the
tent, if nobody’s got any objections. Amos, that wand’s told us all it
can — if Harry could have it back, please —”
Mr. Diggory handed Harry his wand and Harry pocketed it.
“Come on, you three,” Mr. Weasley said quietly. But Hermione
didn’t seem to want to move; her eyes were still upon the sobbing
elf. “Hermione!” Mr. Weasley said, more urgently. She turned and
followed Harry and Ron out of the clearing and off through the
trees.
“What’s going to happen to Winky?” said Hermione, the moment they had left the clearing.
“I don’t know,” said Mr. Weasley.
“The way they were treating her!” said Hermione furiously. “Mr.
Diggory, calling her ‘elf ’ all the time . . . and Mr. Crouch! He
knows she didn’t do it and he’s still going to sack her! He didn’t care
how frightened she’d been, or how upset she was — it was like she
wasn’t even human!”
“Well, she’s not,” said Ron.
Hermione rounded on him.
“That doesn’t mean she hasn’t got feelings, Ron. It’s disgusting
the way —”
“Hermione, I agree with you,” said Mr. Weasley quickly, beckoning her on, “but now is not the time to discuss elf rights. I want
to get back to the tent as fast as we can. What happened to the
others?”


139



CHAPTER NINE
“We lost them in the dark,” said Ron. “Dad, why was everyone so
uptight about that skull thing?”
“I’ll explain everything back at the tent,” said Mr. Weasley
tensely.
But when they reached the edge of the wood, their progress was
impeded. A large crowd of frightened-looking witches and wizards
was congregated there, and when they saw Mr. Weasley coming toward them, many of them surged forward.
“What’s going on in there?”
“Who conjured it?”
“Arthur — it’s not — Him?”
“Of course it’s not Him,” said Mr. Weasley impatiently. “We
don’t know who it was; it looks like they Disapparated. Now excuse
me, please, I want to get to bed.”
He led Harry, Ron, and Hermione through the crowd and back
into the campsite. All was quiet now; there was no sign of the
masked wizards, though several ruined tents were still smoking.
Charlie’s head was poking out of the boys’ tent.
“Dad, what’s going on?” he called through the dark. “Fred,
George, and Ginny got back okay, but the others —”
“I’ve got them here,” said Mr. Weasley, bending down and entering the tent. Harry, Ron, and Hermione entered after him.
Bill was sitting at the small kitchen table, holding a bedsheet to
his arm, which was bleeding profusely. Charlie had a large rip in his
shirt, and Percy was sporting a bloody nose. Fred, George, and
Ginny looked unhurt, though shaken.
“Did you get them, Dad?” said Bill sharply. “The person who
conjured the Mark?”
“No,” said Mr. Weasley. “We found Barty Crouch’s elf holding


140



THE DARK MARK
Harry’s wand, but we’re none the wiser about who actually conjured the Mark.”
“What?” said Bill, Charlie, and Percy together.
“Harry’s wand?” said Fred.
“Mr. Crouch’s elf ?” said Percy, sounding thunderstruck.
With some assistance from Harry, Ron, and Hermione, Mr.
Weasley explained what had happened in the woods. When they
had finished their story, Percy swelled indignantly.
“Well, Mr. Crouch is quite right to get rid of an elf like that!” he
said. “Running away when he’d expressly told her not to . . . embarrassing him in front of the whole Ministry . . . how would that
have looked, if she’d been brought up in front of the Department
for the Regulation and Control —”
“She didn’t do anything — she was just in the wrong place at
the wrong time!” Hermione snapped at Percy, who looked very
taken aback. Hermione had always got on fairly well with Percy —
better, indeed, than any of the others.
“Hermione, a wizard in Mr. Crouch’s position can’t afford a
house-elf who’s going to run amok with a wand!” said Percy
pompously, recovering himself.
“She didn’t run amok!” shouted Hermione. “She just picked it
up off the ground!”
“Look, can someone just explain what that skull thing was?” said
Ron impatiently. “It wasn’t hurting anyone. . . . Why’s it such a big
deal?”
“I told you, it’s You-Know-Who’s symbol, Ron,” said Hermione,
before anyone else could answer. “I read about it in The Rise and
Fall of the Dark Arts.”
“And it hasn’t been seen for thirteen years,” said Mr. Weasley


141



CHAPTER NINE
quietly. “Of course people panicked . . . it was almost like seeing
You-Know-Who back again.”
“I don’t get it,” said Ron, frowning. “I mean . . . it’s still only a
shape in the sky. . . .”
“Ron, You-Know-Who and his followers sent the Dark Mark
into the air whenever they killed,” said Mr. Weasley. “The terror it
inspired . . . you have no idea, you’re too young. Just picture coming home and finding the Dark Mark hovering over your house,
and knowing what you’re about to find inside. . . .” Mr. Weasley
winced. “Everyone’s worst fear . . . the very worst . . .”
There was silence for a moment. Then Bill, removing the sheet
from his arm to check on his cut, said, “Well, it didn’t help us
tonight, whoever conjured it. It scared the Death Eaters away the
moment they saw it. They all Disapparated before we’d got near
enough to unmask any of them. We caught the Robertses before
they hit the ground, though. They’re having their memories modified right now.”
“Death Eaters?” said Harry. “What are Death Eaters?”
“It’s what You-Know-Who’s supporters called themselves,” said
Bill. “I think we saw what’s left of them tonight — the ones who
managed to keep themselves out of Azkaban, anyway.”
“We can’t prove it was them, Bill,” said Mr. Weasley. “Though it
probably was,” he added hopelessly.
“Yeah, I bet it was!” said Ron suddenly. “Dad, we met Draco
Malfoy in the woods, and he as good as told us his dad was one of
those nutters in masks! And we all know the Malfoys were right in
with You-Know-Who!”
“But what were Voldemort’s supporters —” Harry began. Every

142



THE DARK MARK
body flinched — like most of the wizarding world, the Weasleys
always avoided saying Voldemort’s name. “Sorry,” said Harry
quickly. “What were You-Know-Who’s supporters up to, levitating
Muggles? I mean, what was the point?”
“The point?” said Mr. Weasley with a hollow laugh. “Harry,
that’s their idea of fun. Half the Muggle killings back when YouKnow-Who was in power were done for fun. I suppose they had a
few drinks tonight and couldn’t resist reminding us all that lots of
them are still at large. A nice little reunion for them,” he finished
disgustedly.
“But if they were the Death Eaters, why did they Disapparate
when they saw the Dark Mark?” said Ron. “They’d have been
pleased to see it, wouldn’t they?”
“Use your brains, Ron,” said Bill. “If they really were Death
Eaters, they worked very hard to keep out of Azkaban when YouKnow-Who lost power, and told all sorts of lies about him forcing
them to kill and torture people. I bet they’d be even more frightened than the rest of us to see him come back. They denied they’d
ever been involved with him when he lost his powers, and went
back to their daily lives. . . . I don’t reckon he’d be over-pleased
with them, do you?”
“So . . . whoever conjured the Dark Mark . . .” said Hermione
slowly, “were they doing it to show support for the Death Eaters, or
to scare them away?”
“Your guess is as good as ours, Hermione,” said Mr. Weasley.
“But I’ll tell you this . . . it was only the Death Eaters who ever
knew how to conjure it. I’d be very surprised if the person who did
it hadn’t been a Death Eater once, even if they’re not now. . . .

CHAPTER NINE
Listen, it’s very late, and if your mother hears what’s happened
she’ll be worried sick. We’ll get a few more hours sleep and then try
and get an early Portkey out of here.”
Harry got back into his bunk with his head buzzing. He knew he
ought to feel exhausted: It was nearly three in the morning, but he
felt wide-awake — wide-awake, and worried.
Three days ago — it felt like much longer, but it had only been
three days — he had awoken with his scar burning. And tonight,
for the first time in thirteen years, Lord Voldemort’s mark had appeared in the sky. What did these things mean?
He thought of the letter he had written to Sirius before leaving
Privet Drive. Would Sirius have gotten it yet? When would he
reply? Harry lay looking up at the canvas, but no flying fantasies
came to him now to ease him to sleep, and it was a long time after
Charlie’s snores filled the tent that Harry finally dozed off.

M

r. Weasley woke them after only a few hours sleep. He
used magic to pack up the tents, and they left the
campsite as quickly as possible, passing Mr. Roberts at the door of
his cottage. Mr. Roberts had a strange, dazed look about him, and
he waved them off with a vague “Merry Christmas.”
“He’ll be all right,” said Mr. Weasley quietly as they marched off
onto the moor. “Sometimes, when a person’s memory’s modified, it
makes him a bit disorientated for a while . . . and that was a big
thing they had to make him forget.”
They heard urgent voices as they approached the spot where the
Portkeys lay, and when they reached it, they found a great number
of witches and wizards gathered around Basil, the keeper of the
Portkeys, all clamoring to get away from the campsite as quickly as
possible. Mr. Weasley had a hurried discussion with Basil; they
joined the queue, and were able to take an old rubber tire back
to Stoatshead Hill before the sun had really risen. They walked


145



CHAPTER TEN
back through Ottery St. Catchpole and up the damp lane toward
the Burrow in the dawn light, talking very little because they were
so exhausted, and thinking longingly of their breakfast. As they
rounded the corner and the Burrow came into view, a cry echoed
along the lane.
“Oh thank goodness, thank goodness!”
Mrs. Weasley, who had evidently been waiting for them in the
front yard, came running toward them, still wearing her bedroom
slippers, her face pale and strained, a rolled-up copy of the Daily
Prophet clutched in her hand.
“Arthur — I’ve been so worried — so worried —”
She flung her arms around Mr. Weasley’s neck, and the Daily
Prophet fell out of her limp hand onto the ground. Looking down,
Harry saw the headline: SCENES OF TERROR AT THE QUIDDITCH WORLD CUP, complete with a twinkling black-andwhite photograph of the Dark Mark over the treetops.
“You’re all right,” Mrs. Weasley muttered distractedly, releasing
Mr. Weasley and staring around at them all with red eyes, “you’re
alive. . . . Oh boys . . .”
And to everybody’s surprise, she seized Fred and George and
pulled them both into such a tight hug that their heads banged
together.
“Ouch! Mum — you’re strangling us —”
“I shouted at you before you left!” Mrs. Weasley said, starting to
sob. “It’s all I’ve been thinking about! What if You-Know-Who had
got you, and the last thing I ever said to you was that you didn’t get
enough O.W.L.s? Oh Fred . . . George . . .”
“Come on, now, Molly, we’re all perfectly okay,” said Mr.
Weasley soothingly, prising her off the twins and leading her back


146



MAYHEM AT THE
MINISTRY
toward the house. “Bill,” he added in an undertone, “pick up that
paper, I want to see what it says. . . .”
When they were all crammed into the tiny kitchen, and
Hermione had made Mrs. Weasley a cup of very strong tea, into
which Mr. Weasley insisted on pouring a shot of Ogdens Old
Firewhiskey, Bill handed his father the newspaper. Mr. Weasley
scanned the front page while Percy looked over his shoulder.
“I knew it,” said Mr. Weasley heavily. “Ministry blunders . . . culprits not apprehended . . . lax security . . . Dark wizards running
unchecked . . . national disgrace . . . Who wrote this? Ah . . . of
course . . . Rita Skeeter.”
“That woman’s got it in for the Ministry of Magic!” said Percy
furiously. “Last week she was saying we’re wasting our time quibbling about cauldron thickness, when we should be stamping out
vampires! As if it wasn’t specifically stated in paragraph twelve of the
Guidelines for the Treatment of Non-Wizard Part-Humans —”
“Do us a favor, Perce,” said Bill, yawning, “and shut up.”
“I’m mentioned,” said Mr. Weasley, his eyes widening behind
his glasses as he reached the bottom of the Daily Prophet article.
“Where?” spluttered Mrs. Weasley, choking on her tea and
whiskey. “If I’d seen that, I’d have known you were alive!”
“Not by name,” said Mr. Weasley. “Listen to this: ‘If the terrified
wizards and witches who waited breathlessly for news at the edge of the
wood expected reassurance from the Ministry of Magic, they were sadly
disappointed. A Ministry official emerged some time after the appearance of the Dark Mark alleging that nobody had been hurt, but refusing to give any more information. Whether this statement will be
enough to quash the rumors that several bodies were removed from the
woods an hour later, remains to be seen.’ Oh really,” said Mr. Weasley


147



CHAPTER TEN
in exasperation, handing the paper to Percy. “Nobody was hurt.
What was I supposed to say? Rumors that several bodies were removed from the woods . . . well, there certainly will be rumors now
she’s printed that.”
He heaved a deep sigh. “Molly, I’m going to have to go into the
office; this is going to take some smoothing over.”
“I’ll come with you, Father,” said Percy importantly. “Mr.
Crouch will need all hands on deck. And I can give him my cauldron report in person.”
He bustled out of the kitchen. Mrs. Weasley looked most upset.
“Arthur, you’re supposed to be on holiday! This hasn’t got anything to do with your office; surely they can handle this without
you?”
“I’ve got to go, Molly,” said Mr. Weasley. “I’ve made things
worse. I’ll just change into my robes and I’ll be off. . . .”
“Mrs. Weasley,” said Harry suddenly, unable to contain himself,
“Hedwig hasn’t arrived with a letter for me, has she?”
“Hedwig, dear?” said Mrs. Weasley distractedly. “No . . . no,
there hasn’t been any post at all.”
Ron and Hermione looked curiously at Harry. With a meaningful look at both of them he said, “All right if I go and dump my
stuff in your room, Ron?”
“Yeah . . . think I will too,” said Ron at once. “Hermione?”
“Yes,” she said quickly, and the three of them marched out of the
kitchen and up the stairs.
“What’s up, Harry?” said Ron, the moment they had closed the
door of the attic room behind them.
“There’s something I haven’t told you,” Harry said. “On Saturday morning, I woke up with my scar hurting again.”


MAYHEM AT THE

Ron’s and Hermione’s reactions were almost exactly as Harry had
imagined them back in his bedroom on Privet Drive. Hermione
gasped and started making suggestions at once, mentioning a
number of reference books, and everybody from Albus Dumbledore to Madam Pomfrey, the Hogwarts nurse. Ron simply looked
dumbstruck.
“But — he wasn’t there, was he? You-Know-Who? I mean —
last time your scar kept hurting, he was at Hogwarts, wasn’t he?”
“I’m sure he wasn’t on Privet Drive,” said Harry. “But I was
dreaming about him . . . him and Peter — you know, Wormtail. I
can’t remember all of it now, but they were plotting to kill . . .
someone.”
He had teetered for a moment on the verge of saying “me,” but
couldn’t bring himself to make Hermione look any more horrified
than she already did.
“It was only a dream,” said Ron bracingly. “Just a nightmare.”
“Yeah, but was it, though?” said Harry, turning to look out of
the window at the brightening sky. “It’s weird, isn’t it? . . . My scar
hurts, and three days later the Death Eaters are on the march, and
Voldemort’s sign’s up in the sky again.”
“Don’t — say — his — name!” Ron hissed through gritted
teeth.
“And remember what Professor Trelawney said?” Harry went on,
ignoring Ron. “At the end of last year?”
Professor Trelawney was their Divination teacher at Hogwarts.
Hermione’s terrified look vanished as she let out a derisive snort.
“Oh Harry, you aren’t going to pay attention to anything that
old fraud says?”
“You weren’t there,” said Harry. “You didn’t hear her. This time


CHAPTER TEN
was different. I told you, she went into a trance — a real one. And
she said the Dark Lord would rise again . . . greater and more terrible than ever before . . . and he’d manage it because his servant was
going to go back to him . . . and that night Wormtail escaped.”
There was a silence in which Ron fidgeted absentmindedly with
a hole in his Chudley Cannons bedspread.
“Why were you asking if Hedwig had come, Harry?” Hermione
asked. “Are you expecting a letter?”
“I told Sirius about my scar,” said Harry, shrugging. “I’m waiting for his answer.”
“Good thinking!” said Ron, his expression clearing. “I bet Sirius’ll know what to do!”
“I hoped he’d get back to me quickly,” said Harry.
“But we don’t know where Sirius is . . . he could be in Africa or
somewhere, couldn’t he?” said Hermione reasonably. “Hedwig’s
not going to manage that journey in a few days.”
“Yeah, I know,” said Harry, but there was a leaden feeling in his
stomach as he looked out of the window at the Hedwig-free sky.
“Come and have a game of Quidditch in the orchard, Harry,”
said Ron. “Come on — three on three, Bill and Charlie and Fred
and George will play. . . . You can try out the Wronski Feint. . . .”
“Ron,” said Hermione, in an I-don’t-think-you’re-being-verysensitive sort of voice, “Harry doesn’t want to play Quidditch right
now. . . . He’s worried, and he’s tired. . . . We all need to go to
bed. . . .”
“Yeah, I want to play Quidditch,” said Harry suddenly. “Hang
on, I’ll get my Firebolt.”
Hermione left the room, muttering something that sounded
very much like “Boys.”

Neither Mr. Weasley nor Percy was at home much over the following week. Both left the house each morning before the rest of the
family got up, and returned well after dinner every night.
“It’s been an absolute uproar,” Percy told them importantly the
Sunday evening before they were due to return to Hogwarts. “I’ve
been putting out fires all week. People keep sending Howlers, and
of course, if you don’t open a Howler straight away, it explodes.
Scorch marks all over my desk and my best quill reduced to
cinders.”
“Why are they all sending Howlers?” asked Ginny, who was
mending her copy of One Thousand Magical Herbs and Fungi with
Spellotape on the rug in front of the living room fire.
“Complaining about security at the World Cup,” said Percy.
“They want compensation for their ruined property. Mundungus
Fletcher’s put in a claim for a twelve-bedroomed tent with en-suite
Jacuzzi, but I’ve got his number. I know for a fact he was sleeping
under a cloak propped on sticks.”
Mrs. Weasley glanced at the grandfather clock in the corner.
Harry liked this clock. It was completely useless if you wanted to
know the time, but otherwise very informative. It had nine golden
hands, and each of them was engraved with one of the Weasley
family’s names. There were no numerals around the face, but descriptions of where each family member might be. “Home,”
“school,” and “work” were there, but there was also “traveling,”
“lost,” “hospital,” “prison,” and, in the position where the number
twelve would be on a normal clock, “mortal peril.”
Eight of the hands were currently pointing to the “home”

position, but Mr. Weasley’s, which was the longest, was still pointing to “work.” Mrs. Weasley sighed.
“Your father hasn’t had to go into the office on weekends since
the days of You-Know-Who,” she said. “They’re working him far
too hard. His dinner’s going to be ruined if he doesn’t come home
soon.”
“Well, Father feels he’s got to make up for his mistake at the
match, doesn’t he?” said Percy. “If truth be told, he was a tad unwise to make a public statement without clearing it with his Head
of Department first —”
“Don’t you dare blame your father for what that wretched
Skeeter woman wrote!” said Mrs. Weasley, flaring up at once.
“If Dad hadn’t said anything, old Rita would just have said it was
disgraceful that nobody from the Ministry had commented,” said
Bill, who was playing chess with Ron. “Rita Skeeter never makes
anyone look good. Remember, she interviewed all the Gringotts’
Charm Breakers once, and called me ‘a long-haired pillock’?”
“Well, it is a bit long, dear,” said Mrs. Weasley gently. “If you’d
just let me —”
“No, Mum.”
Rain lashed against the living room window. Hermione was immersed in The Standard Book of Spells, Grade 4, copies of which Mrs.
Weasley had bought for her, Harry, and Ron in Diagon Alley.
Charlie was darning a fireproof balaclava. Harry was polishing his
Firebolt, the broomstick servicing kit Hermione had given him for
his thirteenth birthday open at his feet. Fred and George were sitting in a far corner, quills out, talking in whispers, their heads bent
over a piece of parchment.

“What are you two up to?” said Mrs. Weasley sharply, her eyes
on the twins.
“Homework,” said Fred vaguely.
“Don’t be ridiculous, you’re still on holiday,” said Mrs. Weasley.
“Yeah, we’ve left it a bit late,” said George.
“You’re not by any chance writing out a new order form, are
you?” said Mrs. Weasley shrewdly. “You wouldn’t be thinking of restarting Weasleys’ Wizard Wheezes, by any chance?”
“Now, Mum,” said Fred, looking up at her, a pained look on his
face. “If the Hogwarts Express crashed tomorrow, and George and
I died, how would you feel to know that the last thing we ever
heard from you was an unfounded accusation?”
Everyone laughed, even Mrs. Weasley.
“Oh your father’s coming!” she said suddenly, looking up at the
clock again.
Mr. Weasley’s hand had suddenly spun from “work” to “traveling”; a second later it had shuddered to a halt on “home” with the
others, and they heard him calling from the kitchen.
“Coming, Arthur!” called Mrs. Weasley, hurrying out of the
room.
A few moments later, Mr. Weasley came into the warm living
room carrying his dinner on a tray. He looked completely
exhausted.
“Well, the fat’s really in the fire now,” he told Mrs. Weasley as he
sat down in an armchair near the hearth and toyed unenthusiastically with his somewhat shriveled cauliflower. “Rita Skeeter’s been
ferreting around all week, looking for more Ministry mess-ups to
report. And now she’s found out about poor old Bertha going

missing, so that’ll be the headline in the Prophet tomorrow. I told
Bagman he should have sent someone to look for her ages ago.”
“Mr. Crouch has been saying it for weeks and weeks,” said Percy
swiftly.
“Crouch is very lucky Rita hasn’t found out about Winky,” said
Mr. Weasley irritably. “There’d be a week’s worth of headlines in his
house-elf being caught holding the wand that conjured the Dark
Mark.”
“I thought we were all agreed that that elf, while irresponsible,
did not conjure the Mark?” said Percy hotly.
“If you ask me, Mr. Crouch is very lucky no one at the Daily
Prophet knows how mean he is to elves!” said Hermione angrily.
“Now look here, Hermione!” said Percy. “A high-ranking Ministry official like Mr. Crouch deserves unswerving obedience from
his servants —”
“His slave, you mean!” said Hermione, her voice rising passionately, “because he didn’t pay Winky, did he?”
“I think you’d all better go upstairs and check that you’ve packed
properly!” said Mrs. Weasley, breaking up the argument. “Come
on now, all of you. . . .”
Harry repacked his broomstick servicing kit, put his Firebolt
over his shoulder, and went back upstairs with Ron. The rain
sounded even louder at the top of the house, accompanied by loud
whistlings and moans from the wind, not to mention sporadic
howls from the ghoul who lived in the attic. Pigwidgeon began
twittering and zooming around his cage when they entered. The
sight of the half-packed trunks seemed to have sent him into a
frenzy of excitement.

“Bung him some Owl Treats,” said Ron, throwing a packet
across to Harry. “It might shut him up.”
Harry poked a few Owl Treats through the bars of Pigwidgeon’s
cage, then turned to his trunk. Hedwig’s cage stood next to it, still
empty.
“It’s been over a week,” Harry said, looking at Hedwig’s deserted
perch. “Ron, you don’t reckon Sirius has been caught, do you?”
“Nah, it would’ve been in the Daily Prophet,” said Ron. “The
Ministry would want to show they’d caught someone, wouldn’t
they?”
“Yeah, I suppose. . . .”
“Look, here’s the stuff Mum got for you in Diagon Alley. And
she’s got some gold out of your vault for you . . . and she’s washed
all your socks.”
He heaved a pile of parcels onto Harry’s camp bed and dropped
the money bag and a load of socks next to it. Harry started unwrapping the shopping. Apart from The Standard Book of Spells,
Grade 4, by Miranda Goshawk, he had a handful of new quills, a
dozen rolls of parchment, and refills for his potion-making kit —
he had been running low on spine of lionfish and essence of belladonna. He was just piling underwear into his cauldron when Ron
made a loud noise of disgust behind him.
“What is that supposed to be?”
He was holding up something that looked to Harry like a long,
maroon velvet dress. It had a moldy-looking lace frill at the collar
and matching lace cuffs.
There was a knock on the door, and Mrs. Weasley entered, carrying an armful of freshly laundered Hogwarts robes.

“Here you are,” she said, sorting them into two piles. “Now,
mind you pack them properly so they don’t crease.”
“Mum, you’ve given me Ginny’s new dress,” said Ron, handing
it out to her.
“Of course I haven’t,” said Mrs. Weasley. “That’s for you. Dress
robes.”
“What?” said Ron, looking horror-struck.
“Dress robes!” repeated Mrs. Weasley. “It says on your school list
that you’re supposed to have dress robes this year . . . robes for formal occasions.”
“You’ve got to be kidding,” said Ron in disbelief. “I’m not wearing that, no way.”
“Everyone wears them, Ron!” said Mrs. Weasley crossly.
“They’re all like that! Your father’s got some for smart parties!”
“I’ll go starkers before I put that on,” said Ron stubbornly.
“Don’t be so silly,” said Mrs. Weasley. “You’ve got to have dress
robes, they’re on your list! I got some for Harry too . . . show him,
Harry. . . .”
In some trepidation, Harry opened the last parcel on his camp
bed. It wasn’t as bad as he had expected, however; his dress robes
didn’t have any lace on them at all — in fact, they were more or less
the same as his school ones, except that they were bottle green instead of black.
“I thought they’d bring out the color of your eyes, dear,” said
Mrs. Weasley fondly.
“Well, they’re okay!” said Ron angrily, looking at Harry’s robes.
“Why couldn’t I have some like that?”
“Because . . . well, I had to get yours secondhand, and there
wasn’t a lot of choice!” said Mrs. Weasley, flushing.

Harry looked away. He would willingly have split all the money
in his Gringotts vault with the Weasleys, but he knew they would
never take it.
“I’m never wearing them,” Ron was saying stubbornly. “Never.”
“Fine,” snapped Mrs. Weasley. “Go naked. And, Harry, make
sure you get a picture of him. Goodness knows I could do with a
laugh.”
She left the room, slamming the door behind her. There was a
funny spluttering noise from behind them. Pigwidgeon was choking on an overlarge Owl Treat.
“Why is everything I own rubbish?” said Ron furiously, striding
across the room to unstick Pigwidgeon’s beak.

here was a definite end-of-the-holidays gloom in the air
when Harry awoke next morning. Heavy rain was still splattering against the window as he got dressed in jeans and a sweatshirt; they would change into their school robes on the Hogwarts
Express.
He, Ron, Fred, and George had just reached the first-floor landing on their way down to breakfast, when Mrs. Weasley appeared
at the foot of the stairs, looking harassed.
“Arthur!” she called up the staircase. “Arthur! Urgent message
from the Ministry!”
Harry flattened himself against the wall as Mr. Weasley came
clattering past with his robes on back-to-front and hurtled out of
sight. When Harry and the others entered the kitchen, they saw
Mrs. Weasley rummaging anxiously in the drawers — “I’ve got a
quill here somewhere!” — and Mr. Weasley bending over the fire,
talking to —

ABOARD THE
HOGWARTS EXPRESS
Harry shut his eyes hard and opened them again to make sure
that they were working properly.
Amos Diggory’s head was sitting in the middle of the flames like
a large, bearded egg. It was talking very fast, completely unperturbed by the sparks flying around it and the flames licking its ears.
“. . . Muggle neighbors heard bangs and shouting, so they went
and called those what-d’you-call-’ems — please-men. Arthur,
you’ve got to get over there —”
“Here!” said Mrs. Weasley breathlessly, pushing a piece of parchment, a bottle of ink, and a crumpled quill into Mr. Weasley’s
hands.
“— it’s a real stroke of luck I heard about it,” said Mr. Diggory’s
head. “I had to come into the office early to send a couple of owls,
and I found the Improper Use of Magic lot all setting off — if Rita
Skeeter gets hold of this one, Arthur —”
“What does Mad-Eye say happened?” asked Mr. Weasley, unscrewing the ink bottle, loading up his quill, and preparing to take
notes.
Mr. Diggory’s head rolled its eyes. “Says he heard an intruder in
his yard. Says he was creeping toward the house, but was ambushed
by his dustbins.”
“What did the dustbins do?” asked Mr. Weasley, scribbling
frantically.
“Made one hell of a noise and fired rubbish everywhere, as far as
I can tell,” said Mr. Diggory. “Apparently one of them was still
rocketing around when the please-men turned up —”
Mr. Weasley groaned.
“And what about the intruder?”
“Arthur, you know Mad-Eye,” said Mr. Diggory’s head, rolling


159

CHAPTER ELEVEN
its eyes again. “Someone creeping into his yard in the dead of
night? More likely there’s a very shell-shocked cat wandering
around somewhere, covered in potato peelings. But if the Improper
Use of Magic lot get their hands on Mad-Eye, he’s had it — think
of his record — we’ve got to get him off on a minor charge, something in your department — what are exploding dustbins worth?”
“Might be a caution,” said Mr. Weasley, still writing very fast, his
brow furrowed. “Mad-Eye didn’t use his wand? He didn’t actually
attack anyone?”
“I’ll bet he leapt out of bed and started jinxing everything he
could reach through the window,” said Mr. Diggory, “but they’ll
have a job proving it, there aren’t any casualties.”
“All right, I’m off,” Mr. Weasley said, and he stuffed the parchment with his notes on it into his pocket and dashed out of the
kitchen again.
Mr. Diggory’s head looked around at Mrs. Weasley.
“Sorry about this, Molly,” it said, more calmly, “bothering you so
early and everything . . . but Arthur’s the only one who can get
Mad-Eye off, and Mad-Eye’s supposed to be starting his new job
today. Why he had to choose last night . . .”
“Never mind, Amos,” said Mrs. Weasley. “Sure you won’t have a
bit of toast or anything before you go?”
“Oh go on, then,” said Mr. Diggory.
Mrs. Weasley took a piece of buttered toast from a stack on the
kitchen table, put it into the fire tongs, and transferred it into Mr.
Diggory’s mouth.
“Fanks,” he said in a muffled voice, and then, with a small pop,
vanished.
Harry could hear Mr. Weasley calling hurried good-byes to Bill,

Charlie, Percy, and the girls. Within five minutes, he was back in
the kitchen, his robes on the right way now, dragging a comb
through his hair.
“I’d better hurry — you have a good term, boys,” said Mr.
Weasley to Harry, Ron, and the twins, fastening a cloak over his
shoulders and preparing to Disapparate. “Molly, are you going to be
all right taking the kids to King’s Cross?”
“Of course I will,” she said. “You just look after Mad-Eye, we’ll
be fine.”
As Mr. Weasley vanished, Bill and Charlie entered the kitchen.
“Did someone say Mad-Eye?” Bill asked. “What’s he been up to
now?
“He says someone tried to break into his house last night,” said
Mrs. Weasley.
“Mad-Eye Moody?” said George thoughtfully, spreading marmalade on his toast. “Isn’t he that nutter —”
“Your father thinks very highly of Mad-Eye Moody,” said Mrs.
Weasley sternly.
“Yeah, well, Dad collects plugs, doesn’t he?” said Fred quietly as
Mrs. Weasley left the room. “Birds of a feather . . .”
“Moody was a great wizard in his time,” said Bill.
“He’s an old friend of Dumbledore’s, isn’t he?” said Charlie.
“Dumbledore’s not what you’d call normal, though, is he?” said
Fred. “I mean, I know he’s a genius and everything . . .”
“Who is Mad-Eye?” asked Harry.
“He’s retired, used to work at the Ministry,” said Charlie. “I met
him once when Dad took me into work with him. He was an
Auror — one of the best . . . a Dark wizard catcher,” he added, seeing Harry’s blank look. “Half the cells in Azkaban are full because

of him. He made himself loads of enemies, though . . . the families
of people he caught, mainly . . . and I heard he’s been getting really
paranoid in his old age. Doesn’t trust anyone anymore. Sees Dark
wizards everywhere.”
Bill and Charlie decided to come and see everyone off at King’s
Cross station, but Percy, apologizing most profusely, said that he
really needed to get to work.
“I just can’t justify taking more time off at the moment,” he told
them. “Mr. Crouch is really starting to rely on me.”
“Yeah, you know what, Percy?” said George seriously. “I reckon
he’ll know your name soon.”
Mrs. Weasley had braved the telephone in the village post office
to order three ordinary Muggle taxis to take them into London.
“Arthur tried to borrow Ministry cars for us,” Mrs. Weasley
whispered to Harry as they stood in the rain-washed yard, watching the taxi drivers heaving six heavy Hogwarts trunks into their
cars. “But there weren’t any to spare. . . . Oh dear, they don’t look
happy, do they?”
Harry didn’t like to tell Mrs. Weasley that Muggle taxi drivers
rarely transported overexcited owls, and Pigwidgeon was making
an earsplitting racket. Nor did it help that a number of Filibuster’s
Fabulous Wet-Start, No-Heat Fireworks went off unexpectedly
when Fred’s trunk sprang open, causing the driver carrying it to
yell with fright and pain as Crookshanks clawed his way up the
man’s leg.
The journey was uncomfortable, owing to the fact that they
were jammed in the back of the taxis with their trunks. Crookshanks took quite a while to recover from the fireworks, and by the
time they entered London, Harry, Ron, and Hermione were all

severely scratched. They were very relieved to get out at King’s
Cross, even though the rain was coming down harder than ever,
and they got soaked carrying their trunks across the busy road and
into the station.
Harry was used to getting onto platform nine and three-quarters
by now. It was a simple matter of walking straight through the apparently solid barrier dividing platforms nine and ten. The only
tricky part was doing this in an unobtrusive way, so as to avoid attracting Muggle attention. They did it in groups today; Harry, Ron,
and Hermione (the most conspicuous, since they were accompanied by Pigwidgeon and Crookshanks) went first; they leaned casually against the barrier, chatting unconcernedly, and slid sideways
through it . . . and as they did so, platform nine and three-quarters
materialized in front of them.
The Hogwarts Express, a gleaming scarlet steam engine, was already there, clouds of steam billowing from it, through which the
many Hogwarts students and parents on the platform appeared
like dark ghosts. Pigwidgeon became noisier than ever in response
to the hooting of many owls through the mist. Harry, Ron, and
Hermione set off to find seats, and were soon stowing their luggage
in a compartment halfway along the train. They then hopped back
down onto the platform to say good-bye to Mrs. Weasley, Bill, and
Charlie.
“I might be seeing you all sooner than you think,” said Charlie,
grinning, as he hugged Ginny good-bye.
“Why?” said Fred keenly.
“You’ll see,” said Charlie. “Just don’t tell Percy I mentioned
it . . . it’s ‘classified information, until such time as the Ministry
sees fit to release it,’ after all.”

“Yeah, I sort of wish I were back at Hogwarts this year,” said Bill,
hands in his pockets, looking almost wistfully at the train.
“Why?” said George impatiently.
“You’re going to have an interesting year,” said Bill, his eyes
twinkling. “I might even get time off to come and watch a bit of
it. . . .”
“A bit of what?” said Ron.
But at that moment, the whistle blew, and Mrs. Weasley
chivvied them toward the train doors.
“Thanks for having us to stay, Mrs. Weasley,” said Hermione as
they climbed on board, closed the door, and leaned out of the window to talk to her.
“Yeah, thanks for everything, Mrs. Weasley,” said Harry.
“Oh it was my pleasure, dears,” said Mrs. Weasley. “I’d invite
you for Christmas, but . . . well, I expect you’re all going to want to
stay at Hogwarts, what with . . . one thing and another.”
“Mum!” said Ron irritably. “What d’you three know that we
don’t?”
“You’ll find out this evening, I expect,” said Mrs. Weasley, smiling. “It’s going to be very exciting — mind you, I’m very glad
they’ve changed the rules —”
“What rules?” said Harry, Ron, Fred, and George together.
“I’m sure Professor Dumbledore will tell you. . . . Now, behave,
won’t you? Won’t you, Fred? And you, George?”
The pistons hissed loudly and the train began to move.
“Tell us what’s happening at Hogwarts!” Fred bellowed out of
the window as Mrs. Weasley, Bill, and Charlie sped away from
them. “What rules are they changing?”

HOGWARTS EXPRESS
But Mrs. Weasley only smiled and waved. Before the train had
rounded the corner, she, Bill, and Charlie had Disapparated.
Harry, Ron, and Hermione went back to their compartment.
The thick rain splattering the windows made it very difficult to
see out of them. Ron undid his trunk, pulled out his maroon
dress robes, and flung them over Pigwidgeon’s cage to muffle his
hooting.
“Bagman wanted to tell us what’s happening at Hogwarts,” he
said grumpily, sitting down next to Harry. “At the World Cup,
remember? But my own mother won’t say. Wonder what —”
“Shh!” Hermione whispered suddenly, pressing her finger to her
lips and pointing toward the compartment next to theirs. Harry
and Ron listened, and heard a familiar drawling voice drifting in
through the open door.
“. . . Father actually considered sending me to Durmstrang
rather than Hogwarts, you know. He knows the headmaster, you
see. Well, you know his opinion of Dumbledore — the man’s such
a Mudblood-lover — and Durmstrang doesn’t admit that sort of
riffraff. But Mother didn’t like the idea of me going to school so far
away. Father says Durmstrang takes a far more sensible line than
Hogwarts about the Dark Arts. Durmstrang students actually learn
them, not just the defense rubbish we do. . . .”
Hermione got up, tiptoed to the compartment door, and slid it
shut, blocking out Malfoy’s voice.
“So he thinks Durmstrang would have suited him, does he?” she
said angrily. “I wish he had gone, then we wouldn’t have to put up
with him.”
“Durmstrang’s another wizarding school?” said Harry.

CHAPTER ELEVEN
“Yes,” said Hermione sniffily, “and it’s got a horrible reputation.
According to An Appraisal of Magical Education in Europe, it puts a
lot of emphasis on the Dark Arts.”
“I think I’ve heard of it,” said Ron vaguely. “Where is it? What
country?”
“Well, nobody knows, do they?” said Hermione, raising her
eyebrows.
“Er — why not?” said Harry.
“There’s traditionally been a lot of rivalry between all the magic
schools. Durmstrang and Beauxbatons like to conceal their whereabouts so nobody can steal their secrets,” said Hermione matter-offactly.
“Come off it,” said Ron, starting to laugh. “Durmstrang’s got to
be about the same size as Hogwarts — how are you going to hide a
great big castle?”
“But Hogwarts is hidden,” said Hermione, in surprise. “Everyone knows that . . . well, everyone who’s read Hogwarts, A History,
anyway.”
“Just you, then,” said Ron. “So go on — how d’you hide a place
like Hogwarts?”
“It’s bewitched,” said Hermione. “If a Muggle looks at it, all they
see is a moldering old ruin with a sign over the entrance saying
danger, do not enter, unsafe.”
“So Durmstrang’ll just look like a ruin to an outsider too?”
“Maybe,” said Hermione, shrugging, “or it might have Mugglerepelling charms on it, like the World Cup stadium. And to keep foreign wizards from finding it, they’ll have made it Unplottable —”
“Come again?”

“Well, you can enchant a building so it’s impossible to plot on a
map, can’t you?”
“Er . . . if you say so,” said Harry.
“But I think Durmstrang must be somewhere in the far north,”
said Hermione thoughtfully. “Somewhere very cold, because
they’ve got fur capes as part of their uniforms.”
“Ah, think of the possibilities,” said Ron dreamily. “It would’ve
been so easy to push Malfoy off a glacier and make it look like an
accident. . . . Shame his mother likes him. . . .”
The rain became heavier and heavier as the train moved farther
north. The sky was so dark and the windows so steamy that the
lanterns were lit by midday. The lunch trolley came rattling along
the corridor, and Harry bought a large stack of Cauldron Cakes for
them to share.
Several of their friends looked in on them as the afternoon progressed, including Seamus Finnigan, Dean Thomas, and Neville
Longbottom, a round-faced, extremely forgetful boy who had been
brought up by his formidable witch of a grandmother. Seamus was
still wearing his Ireland rosette. Some of its magic seemed to be
wearing off now; it was still squeaking “Troy — Mullet — Moran!”
but in a very feeble and exhausted sort of way. After half an hour or
so, Hermione, growing tired of the endless Quidditch talk, buried
herself once more in The Standard Book of Spells, Grade 4, and
started trying to learn a Summoning Charm.
Neville listened jealously to the others’ conversation as they relived the Cup match.
“Gran didn’t want to go,” he said miserably. “Wouldn’t buy tickets. It sounded amazing though.”

“It was,” said Ron. “Look at this, Neville. . . .”
He rummaged in his trunk up in the luggage rack and pulled out
the miniature figure of Viktor Krum.
“Oh wow,” said Neville enviously as Ron tipped Krum onto his
pudgy hand.
“We saw him right up close, as well,” said Ron. “We were in the
Top Box —”
“For the first and last time in your life, Weasley.”
Draco Malfoy had appeared in the doorway. Behind him stood
Crabbe and Goyle, his enormous, thuggish cronies, both of whom
appeared to have grown at least a foot during the summer. Evidently they had overheard the conversation through the compartment door, which Dean and Seamus had left ajar.
“Don’t remember asking you to join us, Malfoy,” said Harry
coolly.
“Weasley . . . what is that?” said Malfoy, pointing at Pigwidgeon’s cage. A sleeve of Ron’s dress robes was dangling from it, swaying with the motion of the train, the moldy lace cuff very obvious.
Ron made to stuff the robes out of sight, but Malfoy was too
quick for him; he seized the sleeve and pulled.
“Look at this!” said Malfoy in ecstasy, holding up Ron’s robes
and showing Crabbe and Goyle, “Weasley, you weren’t thinking of
wearing these, were you? I mean — they were very fashionable in
about eighteen ninety. . . .”
“Eat dung, Malfoy!” said Ron, the same color as the dress robes
as he snatched them back out of Malfoy’s grip. Malfoy howled with
derisive laughter; Crabbe and Goyle guffawed stupidly.
“So . . . going to enter, Weasley? Going to try and bring a bit of

glory to the family name? There’s money involved as well, you
know . . . you’d be able to afford some decent robes if you won. . . .”
“What are you talking about?” snapped Ron.
“Are you going to enter?” Malfoy repeated. “I suppose you will,
Potter? You never miss a chance to show off, do you?”
“Either explain what you’re on about or go away, Malfoy,” said
Hermione testily, over the top of The Standard Book of Spells, Grade 4.
A gleeful smile spread across Malfoy’s pale face.
“Don’t tell me you don’t know?” he said delightedly. “You’ve got
a father and brother at the Ministry and you don’t even know? My
God, my father told me about it ages ago . . . heard it from Cornelius Fudge. But then, Father’s always associated with the top people at the Ministry. . . . Maybe your father’s too junior to know
about it, Weasley . . . yes . . . they probably don’t talk about important stuff in front of him. . . .”
Laughing once more, Malfoy beckoned to Crabbe and Goyle,
and the three of them disappeared.
Ron got to his feet and slammed the sliding compartment door
so hard behind them that the glass shattered.
“Ron!” said Hermione reproachfully, and she pulled out her
wand, muttered “Reparo!” and the glass shards flew back into a single pane and back into the door.
“Well . . . making it look like he knows everything and we
don’t. . . .” Ron snarled. “ ‘Father’s always associated with the top people at the Ministry.’. . . Dad could’ve got a promotion any time . . .
he just likes it where he is. . . .”
“Of course he does,” said Hermione quietly. “Don’t let Malfoy
get to you, Ron —”

“Him! Get to me!? As if !” said Ron, picking up one of the remaining Cauldron Cakes and squashing it into a pulp.
Ron’s bad mood continued for the rest of the journey. He didn’t
talk much as they changed into their school robes, and was still
glowering when the Hogwarts Express slowed down at last and finally stopped in the pitch-darkness of Hogsmeade station.
As the train doors opened, there was a rumble of thunder overhead. Hermione bundled up Crookshanks in her cloak and Ron
left his dress robes over Pigwidgeon as they left the train, heads
bent and eyes narrowed against the downpour. The rain was now
coming down so thick and fast that it was as though buckets of icecold water were being emptied repeatedly over their heads.
“Hi, Hagrid!” Harry yelled, seeing a gigantic silhouette at the far
end of the platform.
“All righ’, Harry?” Hagrid bellowed back, waving. “See yeh at
the feast if we don’ drown!”
First years traditionally reached Hogwarts Castle by sailing
across the lake with Hagrid.
“Oooh, I wouldn’t fancy crossing the lake in this weather,” said
Hermione fervently, shivering as they inched slowly along the dark
platform with the rest of the crowd. A hundred horseless carriages
stood waiting for them outside the station. Harry, Ron, Hermione,
and Neville climbed gratefully into one of them, the door shut
with a snap, and a few moments later, with a great lurch, the long
procession of carriages was rumbling and splashing its way up the
track toward Hogwarts Castle.

hrough the gates, flanked with statues of winged boars, and
up the sweeping drive the carriages trundled, swaying dangerously in what was fast becoming a gale. Leaning against the window, Harry could see Hogwarts coming nearer, its many lighted
windows blurred and shimmering behind the thick curtain of rain.
Lightning flashed across the sky as their carriage came to a halt
before the great oak front doors, which stood at the top of a flight
of stone steps. People who had occupied the carriages in front were
already hurrying up the stone steps into the castle. Harry, Ron,
Hermione, and Neville jumped down from their carriage and
dashed up the steps too, looking up only when they were safely
inside the cavernous, torch-lit entrance hall, with its magnificent
marble staircase.
“Blimey,” said Ron, shaking his head and sending water everywhere, “if that keeps up the lake’s going to overflow. I’m soak —
ARRGH!”

CHAPTER TWELVE
A large, red, water-filled balloon had dropped from out of the
ceiling onto Ron’s head and exploded. Drenched and sputtering,
Ron staggered sideways into Harry, just as a second water bomb
dropped — narrowly missing Hermione, it burst at Harry’s feet,
sending a wave of cold water over his sneakers into his socks. People all around them shrieked and started pushing one another in
their efforts to get out of the line of fire. Harry looked up and saw,
floating twenty feet above them, Peeves the Poltergeist, a little man
in a bell-covered hat and orange bow tie, his wide, malicious face
contorted with concentration as he took aim again.
“PEEVES!” yelled an angry voice. “Peeves, come down here at
ONCE!”
Professor McGonagall, Deputy Headmistress and head of Gryffindor House, had come dashing out of the Great Hall; she skidded
on the wet floor and grabbed Hermione around the neck to stop
herself from falling.
“Ouch — sorry, Miss Granger —”
“That’s all right, Professor!” Hermione gasped, massaging her
throat.
“Peeves, get down here NOW!” barked Professor McGonagall,
straightening her pointed hat and glaring upward through her
square-rimmed spectacles.
“Not doing nothing!” cackled Peeves, lobbing a water bomb at
several fifth-year girls, who screamed and dived into the Great
Hall. “Already wet, aren’t they? Little squirts! Wheeeeeeeeee!” And
he aimed another bomb at a group of second years who had just
arrived.
“I shall call the headmaster!” shouted Professor McGonagall.
“I’m warning you, Peeves —”


THE TRIWIZARD
TOURNAMENT
Peeves stuck out his tongue, threw the last of his water bombs
into the air, and zoomed off up the marble staircase, cackling
insanely.
“Well, move along, then!” said Professor McGonagall sharply to
the bedraggled crowd. “Into the Great Hall, come on!”
Harry, Ron, and Hermione slipped and slid across the entrance
hall and through the double doors on the right, Ron muttering
furiously under his breath as he pushed his sopping hair off his
face.
The Great Hall looked its usual splendid self, decorated for the
start-of-term feast. Golden plates and goblets gleamed by the light
of hundreds and hundreds of candles, floating over the tables in
midair. The four long House tables were packed with chattering
students; at the top of the Hall, the staff sat along one side of a fifth
table, facing their pupils. It was much warmer in here. Harry, Ron,
and Hermione walked past the Slytherins, the Ravenclaws, and the
Hufflepuffs, and sat down with the rest of the Gryffindors at the far
side of the Hall, next to Nearly Headless Nick, the Gryffindor
ghost. Pearly white and semitransparent, Nick was dressed tonight
in his usual doublet, but with a particularly large ruff, which served
the dual purpose of looking extra-festive, and insuring that his
head didn’t wobble too much on his partially severed neck.
“Good evening,” he said, beaming at them.
“Says who?” said Harry, taking off his sneakers and emptying
them of water. “Hope they hurry up with the Sorting. I’m
starving.”
The Sorting of the new students into Houses took place at the
start of every school year, but by an unlucky combination of circumstances, Harry hadn’t been present at one since his own. He


173



CHAPTER TWELVE
was quite looking forward to it. Just then, a highly excited, breathless voice called down the table.
“Hiya, Harry!”
It was Colin Creevey, a third year to whom Harry was something of a hero.
“Hi, Colin,” said Harry warily.
“Harry, guess what? Guess what, Harry? My brother’s starting!
My brother Dennis!”
“Er — good,” said Harry.
“He’s really excited!” said Colin, practically bouncing up and
down in his seat. “I just hope he’s in Gryffindor! Keep your fingers
crossed, eh, Harry?”
“Er — yeah, all right,” said Harry. He turned back to Hermione, Ron, and Nearly Headless Nick. “Brothers and sisters usually
go in the same Houses, don’t they?” he said. He was judging by the
Weasleys, all seven of whom had been put into Gryffindor.
“Oh no, not necessarily,” said Hermione. “Parvati Patil’s twin’s
in Ravenclaw, and they’re identical. You’d think they’d be together,
wouldn’t you?”
Harry looked up at the staff table. There seemed to be rather
more empty seats there than usual. Hagrid, of course, was still fighting his way across the lake with the first years; Professor McGonagall
was presumably supervising the drying of the entrance hall floor,
but there was another empty chair too, and Harry couldn’t think
who else was missing.
“Where’s the new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher?” said
Hermione, who was also looking up at the teachers.
They had never yet had a Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher
who had lasted more than three terms. Harry’s favorite by far had


174



THE TRIWIZARD
TOURNAMENT
been Professor Lupin, who had resigned last year. He looked up
and down the staff table. There was definitely no new face there.
“Maybe they couldn’t get anyone!” said Hermione, looking
anxious.
Harry scanned the table more carefully. Tiny little Professor
Flitwick, the Charms teacher, was sitting on a large pile of cushions
beside Professor Sprout, the Herbology teacher, whose hat was
askew over her flyaway gray hair. She was talking to Professor Sinistra of the Astronomy department. On Professor Sinistra’s other
side was the sallow-faced, hook-nosed, greasy-haired Potions master, Snape — Harry’s least favorite person at Hogwarts. Harry’s
loathing of Snape was matched only by Snape’s hatred of him, a hatred which had, if possible, intensified last year, when Harry had
helped Sirius escape right under Snape’s overlarge nose — Snape
and Sirius had been enemies since their own school days.
On Snape’s other side was an empty seat, which Harry guessed
was Professor McGonagall’s. Next to it, and in the very center of
the table, sat Professor Dumbledore, the headmaster, his sweeping
silver hair and beard shining in the candlelight, his magnificent
deep green robes embroidered with many stars and moons. The
tips of Dumbledore’s long, thin fingers were together and he was
resting his chin upon them, staring up at the ceiling through his
half-moon spectacles as though lost in thought. Harry glanced up
at the ceiling too. It was enchanted to look like the sky outside, and
he had never seen it look this stormy. Black and purple clouds were
swirling across it, and as another thunderclap sounded outside, a
fork of lightning flashed across it.
“Oh hurry up,” Ron moaned, beside Harry, “I could eat a
hippogriff.”


175



CHAPTER TWELVE
The words were no sooner out of his mouth than the doors of
the Great Hall opened and silence fell. Professor McGonagall was
leading a long line of first years up to the top of the Hall. If Harry,
Ron, and Hermione were wet, it was nothing to how these first
years looked. They appeared to have swum across the lake rather
than sailed. All of them were shivering with a combination of cold
and nerves as they filed along the staff table and came to a halt in a
line facing the rest of the school — all of them except the smallest
of the lot, a boy with mousy hair, who was wrapped in what Harry
recognized as Hagrid’s moleskin overcoat. The coat was so big for
him that it looked as though he were draped in a furry black circus
tent. His small face protruded from over the collar, looking almost
painfully excited. When he had lined up with his terrified-looking
peers, he caught Colin Creevey’s eye, gave a double thumbs-up,
and mouthed, I fell in the lake! He looked positively delighted
about it.
Professor McGonagall now placed a three-legged stool on the
ground before the first years and, on top of it, an extremely old,
dirty, patched wizard’s hat. The first years stared at it. So did everyone else. For a moment, there was silence. Then a long tear near the
brim opened wide like a mouth, and the hat broke into song:
A thousand years or more ago,
When I was newly sewn,
There lived four wizards of renown,
Whose names are still well known:
Bold Gryffindor, from wild moor,
Fair Ravenclaw, from glen,
Sweet Hufflepuff, from valley broad,


176



THE TRIWIZARD
TOURNAMENT
Shrewd Slytherin, from fen.
They shared a wish, a hope, a dream,
They hatched a daring plan
To educate young sorcerers
Thus Hogwarts School began.
Now each of these four founders
Formed their own house, for each
Did value different virtues
In the ones they had to teach.
By Gryffindor, the bravest were
Prized far beyond the rest;
For Ravenclaw, the cleverest
Would always be the best;
For Hufflepuff, hard workers were
Most worthy of admission;
And power-hungry Slytherin
Loved those of great ambition.
While still alive they did divide
Their favorites from the throng,
Yet how to pick the worthy ones
When they were dead and gone?
‘Twas Gryffindor who found the way,
He whipped me off his head
The founders put some brains in me
So I could choose instead!
Now slip me snug about your ears,
I’ve never yet been wrong,
I’ll have a look inside your mind
And tell where you belong!


CHAPTER TWELVE
The Great Hall rang with applause as the Sorting Hat finished.
“That’s not the song it sang when it Sorted us,” said Harry, clapping along with everyone else.
“Sings a different one every year,” said Ron. “It’s got to be a
pretty boring life, hasn’t it, being a hat? I suppose it spends all year
making up the next one.”
Professor McGonagall was now unrolling a large scroll of
parchment.
“When I call out your name, you will put on the hat and sit on
the stool,” she told the first years. “When the hat announces your
House, you will go and sit at the appropriate table.
“Ackerley, Stewart!”
A boy walked forward, visibly trembling from head to foot,
picked up the Sorting Hat, put it on, and sat down on the stool.
“RAVENCLAW!” shouted the hat.
Stewart Ackerley took off the hat and hurried into a seat at the
Ravenclaw table, where everyone was applauding him. Harry
caught a glimpse of Cho, the Ravenclaw Seeker, cheering Stewart
Ackerley as he sat down. For a fleeting second, Harry had a strange
desire to join the Ravenclaw table too.
“Baddock, Malcolm!”
“SLYTHERIN!”
The table on the other side of the hall erupted with cheers;
Harry could see Malfoy clapping as Baddock joined the Slytherins.
Harry wondered whether Baddock knew that Slytherin House had
turned out more Dark witches and wizards than any other. Fred
and George hissed Malcolm Baddock as he sat down.
“Branstone, Eleanor!”
“HUFFLEPUFF!”


178

THE TRIWIZARD
TOURNAMENT
“Cauldwell, Owen!”
“HUFFLEPUFF!”
“Creevey, Dennis!”
Tiny Dennis Creevey staggered forward, tripping over Hagrid’s
moleskin, just as Hagrid himself sidled into the Hall through a
door behind the teachers’ table. About twice as tall as a normal
man, and at least three times as broad, Hagrid, with his long, wild,
tangled black hair and beard, looked slightly alarming — a misleading impression, for Harry, Ron, and Hermione knew Hagrid
to possess a very kind nature. He winked at them as he sat down at
the end of the staff table and watched Dennis Creevey putting on
the Sorting Hat. The rip at the brim opened wide —
“GRYFFINDOR!” the hat shouted.
Hagrid clapped along with the Gryffindors as Dennis Creevey,
beaming widely, took off the hat, placed it back on the stool, and
hurried over to join his brother.
“Colin, I fell in!” he said shrilly, throwing himself into an empty
seat. “It was brilliant! And something in the water grabbed me and
pushed me back in the boat!”
“Cool!” said Colin, just as excitedly. “It was probably the giant
squid, Dennis!”
“Wow!” said Dennis, as though nobody in their wildest dreams
could hope for more than being thrown into a storm-tossed, fathoms-deep lake, and pushed out of it again by a giant sea monster.
“Dennis! Dennis! See that boy down there? The one with the
black hair and glasses? See him? Know who he is, Dennis?”
Harry looked away, staring very hard at the Sorting Hat, now
Sorting Emma Dobbs.
The Sorting continued; boys and girls with varying degrees of

CHAPTER TWELVE
fright on their faces moving one by one to the three-legged stool,
the line dwindling slowly as Professor McGonagall passed the L’s.
“Oh hurry up,” Ron moaned, massaging his stomach.
“Now, Ron, the Sorting’s much more important than food,” said
Nearly Headless Nick as “Madley, Laura!” became a Hufflepuff.
“ ’Course it is, if you’re dead,” snapped Ron.
“I do hope this year’s batch of Gryffindors are up to scratch,”
said Nearly Headless Nick, applauding as “McDonald, Natalie!”
joined the Gryffindor table. “We don’t want to break our winning
streak, do we?”
Gryffindor had won the Inter-House Championship for the last
three years in a row.
“Pritchard, Graham!”
“SLYTHERIN!”
“Quirke, Orla!”
“RAVENCLAW!”
And finally, with “Whitby, Kevin!” (“HUFFLEPUFF!”), the
Sorting ended. Professor McGonagall picked up the hat and the
stool and carried them away.
“About time,” said Ron, seizing his knife and fork and looking
expectantly at his golden plate.
Professor Dumbledore had gotten to his feet. He was smiling
around at the students, his arms opened wide in welcome.
“I have only two words to say to you,” he told them, his deep
voice echoing around the Hall. “Tuck in.”
“Hear, hear!” said Harry and Ron loudly as the empty dishes
filled magically before their eyes.
Nearly Headless Nick watched mournfully as Harry, Ron, and
Hermione loaded their own plates.

TOURNAMENT
“Aaah, ’at’s be’er,” said Ron, with his mouth full of mashed
potato.
“You’re lucky there’s a feast at all tonight, you know,” said Nearly
Headless Nick. “There was trouble in the kitchens earlier.”
“Why? Wha’ ’appened?” said Harry, through a sizable chunk of
steak.
“Peeves, of course,” said Nearly Headless Nick, shaking his head,
which wobbled dangerously. He pulled his ruff a little higher up on
his neck. “The usual argument, you know. He wanted to attend the
feast — well, it’s quite out of the question, you know what he’s
like, utterly uncivilized, can’t see a plate of food without throwing
it. We held a ghost’s council — the Fat Friar was all for giving him
the chance — but most wisely, in my opinion, the Bloody Baron
put his foot down.”
The Bloody Baron was the Slytherin ghost, a gaunt and silent
specter covered in silver bloodstains. He was the only person at
Hogwarts who could really control Peeves.
“Yeah, we thought Peeves seemed hacked off about something,”
said Ron darkly. “So what did he do in the kitchens?”
“Oh the usual,” said Nearly Headless Nick, shrugging. “Wreaked
havoc and mayhem. Pots and pans everywhere. Place swimming in
soup. Terrified the house-elves out of their wits —”
Clang.
Hermione had knocked over her golden goblet. Pumpkin juice
spread steadily over the tablecloth, staining several feet of white
linen orange, but Hermione paid no attention.
“There are house-elves here?” she said, staring, horror-struck, at
Nearly Headless Nick. “Here at Hogwarts?”
“Certainly,” said Nearly Headless Nick, looking surprised at her

CHAPTER TWELVE
reaction. “The largest number in any dwelling in Britain, I believe.
Over a hundred.”
“I’ve never seen one!” said Hermione.
“Well, they hardly ever leave the kitchen by day, do they?” said
Nearly Headless Nick. “They come out at night to do a bit of
cleaning . . . see to the fires and so on. . . . I mean, you’re not supposed to see them, are you? That’s the mark of a good house-elf,
isn’t it, that you don’t know it’s there?”
Hermione stared at him.
“But they get paid?” she said. “They get holidays, don’t they?
And — and sick leave, and pensions, and everything?”
Nearly Headless Nick chortled so much that his ruff slipped and
his head flopped off, dangling on the inch or so of ghostly skin and
muscle that still attached it to his neck.
“Sick leave and pensions?” he said, pushing his head back onto his
shoulders and securing it once more with his ruff. “House-elves
don’t want sick leave and pensions!”
Hermione looked down at her hardly touched plate of food,
then put her knife and fork down upon it and pushed it away from
her.
“Oh c’mon, ’Er-my-knee,” said Ron, accidentally spraying
Harry with bits of Yorkshire pudding. “Oops — sorry, ’Arry —”
He swallowed. “You won’t get them sick leave by starving yourself !”
“Slave labor,” said Hermione, breathing hard through her nose.
“That’s what made this dinner. Slave labor.”
And she refused to eat another bite.
The rain was still drumming heavily against the high, dark glass.
Another clap of thunder shook the windows, and the stormy


THE TRIWIZARD
TOURNAMENT
ceiling flashed, illuminating the golden plates as the remains of the
first course vanished and were replaced, instantly, with puddings.
“Treacle tart, Hermione!” said Ron, deliberately wafting its
smell toward her. “Spotted dick, look! Chocolate gateau!”
But Hermione gave him a look so reminiscent of Professor
McGonagall that he gave up.
When the puddings too had been demolished, and the last
crumbs had faded off the plates, leaving them sparkling clean,
Albus Dumbledore got to his feet again. The buzz of chatter filling
the Hall ceased almost at once, so that only the howling wind and
pounding rain could be heard.
“So!” said Dumbledore, smiling around at them all. “Now that
we are all fed and watered,” (“Hmph!” said Hermione) “I must
once more ask for your attention, while I give out a few notices.
“Mr. Filch, the caretaker, has asked me to tell you that the list of
objects forbidden inside the castle has this year been extended to
include Screaming Yo-yos, Fanged Frisbees, and Ever-Bashing
Boomerangs. The full list comprises some four hundred and thirtyseven items, I believe, and can be viewed in Mr. Filch’s office, if
anybody would like to check it.”
The corners of Dumbledore’s mouth twitched. He continued,
“As ever, I would like to remind you all that the forest on the
grounds is out-of-bounds to students, as is the village of Hogsmeade to all below third year.
“It is also my painful duty to inform you that the Inter-House
Quidditch Cup will not take place this year.”
“What?” Harry gasped. He looked around at Fred and George,
his fellow members of the Quidditch team. They were mouthing


183



CHAPTER TWELVE
soundlessly at Dumbledore, apparently too appalled to speak.
Dumbledore went on, “This is due to an event that will be starting
in October, and continuing throughout the school year, taking up
much of the teachers’ time and energy — but I am sure you will all
enjoy it immensely. I have great pleasure in announcing that this
year at Hogwarts —”
But at that moment, there was a deafening rumble of thunder
and the doors of the Great Hall banged open.
A man stood in the doorway, leaning upon a long staff,
shrouded in a black traveling cloak. Every head in the Great Hall
swiveled toward the stranger, suddenly brightly illuminated by a
fork of lightning that flashed across the ceiling. He lowered his
hood, shook out a long mane of grizzled, dark gray hair, then began to walk up toward the teachers’ table.
A dull clunk echoed through the Hall on his every other step. He
reached the end of the top table, turned right, and limped heavily
toward Dumbledore. Another flash of lightning crossed the ceiling.
Hermione gasped.
The lightning had thrown the man’s face into sharp relief, and it
was a face unlike any Harry had ever seen. It looked as though it
had been carved out of weathered wood by someone who had only
the vaguest idea of what human faces are supposed to look like, and
was none too skilled with a chisel. Every inch of skin seemed to be
scarred. The mouth looked like a diagonal gash, and a large chunk
of the nose was missing. But it was the man’s eyes that made him
frightening.
One of them was small, dark, and beady. The other was large,
round as a coin, and a vivid, electric blue. The blue eye was mov

184



THE TRIWIZARD
TOURNAMENT
ing ceaselessly, without blinking, and was rolling up, down, and
from side to side, quite independently of the normal eye — and
then it rolled right over, pointing into the back of the man’s head,
so that all they could see was whiteness.
The stranger reached Dumbledore. He stretched out a hand that
was as badly scarred as his face, and Dumbledore shook it, muttering words Harry couldn’t hear. He seemed to be making some inquiry of the stranger, who shook his head unsmilingly and replied
in an undertone. Dumbledore nodded and gestured the man to the
empty seat on his right-hand side.
The stranger sat down, shook his mane of dark gray hair out of
his face, pulled a plate of sausages toward him, raised it to what was
left of his nose, and sniffed it. He then took a small knife out of his
pocket, speared a sausage on the end of it, and began to eat. His
normal eye was fixed upon the sausages, but the blue eye was still
darting restlessly around in its socket, taking in the Hall and the
students.
“May I introduce our new Defense Against the Dark Arts
teacher?” said Dumbledore brightly into the silence. “Professor
Moody.”
It was usual for new staff members to be greeted with applause,
but none of the staff or students clapped except Dumbledore and
Hagrid, who both put their hands together and applauded, but the
sound echoed dismally into the silence, and they stopped fairly
quickly. Everyone else seemed too transfixed by Moody’s bizarre
appearance to do more than stare at him.
“Moody?” Harry muttered to Ron. “Mad-Eye Moody? The one
your dad went to help this morning?”


185



CHAPTER TWELVE
“Must be,” said Ron in a low, awed voice.
“What happened to him?” Hermione whispered. “What happened to his face?”
“Dunno,” Ron whispered back, watching Moody with fascination.
Moody seemed totally indifferent to his less-than-warm welcome. Ignoring the jug of pumpkin juice in front of him, he
reached again into his traveling cloak, pulled out a hip flask, and
took a long draught from it. As he lifted his arm to drink, his cloak
was pulled a few inches from the ground, and Harry saw, below the
table, several inches of carved wooden leg, ending in a clawed foot.
Dumbledore cleared his throat.
“As I was saying,” he said, smiling at the sea of students before
him, all of whom were still gazing transfixed at Mad-Eye Moody,
“we are to have the honor of hosting a very exciting event over the
coming months, an event that has not been held for over a century.
It is my very great pleasure to inform you that the Triwizard Tournament will be taking place at Hogwarts this year.”
“You’re JOKING!” said Fred Weasley loudly.
The tension that had filled the Hall ever since Moody’s arrival
suddenly broke. Nearly everyone laughed, and Dumbledore chuckled appreciatively.
“I am not joking, Mr. Weasley,” he said, “though now that you
mention it, I did hear an excellent one over the summer about a
troll, a hag, and a leprechaun who all go into a bar . . .”
Professor McGonagall cleared her throat loudly.
“Er — but maybe this is not the time . . . no . . .” said Dumbledore, “where was I? Ah yes, the Triwizard Tournament . . . well,
some of you will not know what this tournament involves, so I

hope those who do know will forgive me for giving a short explanation, and allow their attention to wander freely.
“The Triwizard Tournament was first established some seven
hundred years ago as a friendly competition between the three
largest European schools of wizardry: Hogwarts, Beauxbatons, and
Durmstrang. A champion was selected to represent each school,
and the three champions competed in three magical tasks. The
schools took it in turns to host the tournament once every five
years, and it was generally agreed to be a most excellent way of establishing ties between young witches and wizards of different nationalities — until, that is, the death toll mounted so high that the
tournament was discontinued.”
“Death toll ?” Hermione whispered, looking alarmed. But her
anxiety did not seem to be shared by the majority of students in the
Hall; many of them were whispering excitedly to one another, and
Harry himself was far more interested in hearing about the tournament than in worrying about deaths that had happened hundreds
of years ago.
“There have been several attempts over the centuries to reinstate
the tournament,” Dumbledore continued, “none of which has
been very successful. However, our own departments of International Magical Cooperation and Magical Games and Sports have
decided the time is ripe for another attempt. We have worked hard
over the summer to ensure that this time, no champion will find
himself or herself in mortal danger.
“The heads of Beauxbatons and Durmstrang will be arriving
with their short-listed contenders in October, and the selection of
the three champions will take place at Halloween. An impartial
judge will decide which students are most worthy to compete for


187



CHAPTER TWELVE
the Triwizard Cup, the glory of their school, and a thousand
Galleons personal prize money.”
“I’m going for it!” Fred Weasley hissed down the table, his face
lit with enthusiasm at the prospect of such glory and riches. He was
not the only person who seemed to be visualizing himself as the
Hogwarts champion. At every House table, Harry could see people
either gazing raptly at Dumbledore, or else whispering fervently to
their neighbors. But then Dumbledore spoke again, and the Hall
quieted once more.
“Eager though I know all of you will be to bring the Triwizard
Cup to Hogwarts,” he said, “the heads of the participating schools,
along with the Ministry of Magic, have agreed to impose an age
restriction on contenders this year. Only students who are of age —
that is to say, seventeen years or older — will be allowed to put forward their names for consideration. This” — Dumbledore raised his
voice slightly, for several people had made noises of outrage at these
words, and the Weasley twins were suddenly looking furious — “is
a measure we feel is necessary, given that the tournament tasks will
still be difficult and dangerous, whatever precautions we take, and it
is highly unlikely that students below sixth and seventh year will be
able to cope with them. I will personally be ensuring that no underage student hoodwinks our impartial judge into making them Hogwarts champion.” His light blue eyes twinkled as they flickered over
Fred’s and George’s mutinous faces. “I therefore beg you not to waste
your time submitting yourself if you are under seventeen.
“The delegations from Beauxbatons and Durmstrang will be arriving in October and remaining with us for the greater part of this
year. I know that you will all extend every courtesy to our foreign
guests while they are with us, and will give your whole-hearted sup

port to the Hogwarts champion when he or she is selected. And
now, it is late, and I know how important it is to you all to be alert
and rested as you enter your lessons tomorrow morning. Bedtime!
Chop chop!”
Dumbledore sat down again and turned to talk to Mad-Eye
Moody. There was a great scraping and banging as all the students
got to their feet and swarmed toward the double doors into the entrance hall.
“They can’t do that!” said George Weasley, who had not joined
the crowd moving toward the door, but was standing up and glaring at Dumbledore. “We’re seventeen in April, why can’t we have a
shot?”
“They’re not stopping me entering,” said Fred stubbornly, also
scowling at the top table. “The champions’ll get to do all sorts of
stuff you’d never be allowed to do normally. And a thousand
Galleons prize money!”
“Yeah,” said Ron, a faraway look on his face. “Yeah, a thousand
Galleons . . .”
“Come on,” said Hermione, “we’ll be the only ones left here if
you don’t move.”
Harry, Ron, Hermione, Fred, and George set off for the entrance hall, Fred and George debating the ways in which Dumbledore might stop those who were under seventeen from entering the
tournament.
“Who’s this impartial judge who’s going to decide who the
champions are?” said Harry.
“Dunno,” said Fred, “but it’s them we’ll have to fool. I reckon a
couple of drops of Aging Potion might do it, George. . . .”
“Dumbledore knows you’re not of age, though,” said Ron.


189



CHAPTER TWELVE
“Yeah, but he’s not the one who decides who the champion is, is
he?” said Fred shrewdly. “Sounds to me like once this judge knows
who wants to enter, he’ll choose the best from each school and
never mind how old they are. Dumbledore’s trying to stop us giving our names.”
“People have died, though!” said Hermione in a worried voice
as they walked through a door concealed behind a tapestry and
started up another, narrower staircase.
“Yeah,” said Fred airily, “but that was years ago, wasn’t it? Anyway, where’s the fun without a bit of risk? Hey, Ron, what if we find
out how to get ’round Dumbledore? Fancy entering?”
“What d’you reckon?” Ron asked Harry. “Be cool to enter,
wouldn’t it? But I s’pose they might want someone older. . . .
Dunno if we’ve learned enough. . . .”
“I definitely haven’t,” came Neville’s gloomy voice from behind
Fred and George.
“I expect my gran’d want me to try, though. She’s always going
on about how I should be upholding the family honor. I’ll just have
to — oops. . . .”
Neville’s foot had sunk right through a step halfway up the
staircase. There were many of these trick stairs at Hogwarts; it was
second nature to most of the older students to jump this particular step, but Neville’s memory was notoriously poor. Harry and
Ron seized him under the armpits and pulled him out, while a suit
of armor at the top of the stairs creaked and clanked, laughing
wheezily.
“Shut it, you,” said Ron, banging down its visor as they passed.
They made their way up to the entrance to Gryffindor Tower,

TOURNAMENT
which was concealed behind a large portrait of a fat lady in a pink
silk dress.
“Password?” she said as they approached.
“Balderdash,” said George, “a prefect downstairs told me.”
The portrait swung forward to reveal a hole in the wall through
which they all climbed. A crackling fire warmed the circular common room, which was full of squashy armchairs and tables. Hermione cast the merrily dancing flames a dark look, and Harry
distinctly heard her mutter “Slave labor,” before bidding them
good night and disappearing through the doorway to the girls’
dormitory.
Harry, Ron, and Neville climbed up the last, spiral staircase until they reached their own dormitory, which was situated at the top
of the tower. Five four-poster beds with deep crimson hangings
stood against the walls, each with its owner’s trunk at the foot.
Dean and Seamus were already getting into bed; Seamus had
pinned his Ireland rosette to his headboard, and Dean had tacked
up a poster of Viktor Krum over his bedside table. His old poster
of the West Ham football team was pinned right next to it.
“Mental,” Ron sighed, shaking his head at the completely stationary soccer players.
Harry, Ron, and Neville got into their pajamas and into bed.
Someone — a house-elf, no doubt — had placed warming pans
between the sheets. It was extremely comfortable, lying there in
bed and listening to the storm raging outside.
“I might go in for it, you know,” Ron said sleepily through the
darkness, “if Fred and George find out how to . . . the tournament . . . you never know, do you?”

“S’pose not. . . .”
Harry rolled over in bed, a series of dazzling new pictures forming in his mind’s eye. . . . He had hoodwinked the impartial judge
into believing he was seventeen . . . he had become Hogwarts
champion . . . he was standing on the grounds, his arms raised in
triumph in front of the whole school, all of whom were applauding
and screaming . . . he had just won the Triwizard Tournament. . . .
Cho’s face stood out particularly clearly in the blurred crowd, her
face glowing with admiration. . . .
Harry grinned into his pillow, exceptionally glad that Ron
couldn’t see what he could.

he storm had blown itself out by the following morning,
though the ceiling in the Great Hall was still gloomy; heavy
clouds of pewter gray swirled overhead as Harry, Ron, and Hermione examined their new course schedules at breakfast. A few seats
along, Fred, George, and Lee Jordan were discussing magical methods of aging themselves and bluffing their way into the Triwizard
Tournament.
“Today’s not bad . . . outside all morning,” said Ron, who was
running his finger down the Monday column of his schedule. “Herbology with the Hufflepuffs and Care of Magical Creatures . . .
damn it, we’re still with the Slytherins. . . .”
“Double Divination this afternoon,” Harry groaned, looking
down. Divination was his least favorite subject, apart from Potions.
Professor Trelawney kept predicting Harry’s death, which he found
extremely annoying.
“You should have given it up like me, shouldn’t you?” said

CHAPTER THIRTEEN
Hermione briskly, buttering herself some toast. “Then you’d be doing something sensible like Arithmancy.”
“You’re eating again, I notice,” said Ron, watching Hermione
adding liberal amounts of jam to her toast too.
“I’ve decided there are better ways of making a stand about elf
rights,” said Hermione haughtily.
“Yeah . . . and you were hungry,” said Ron, grinning.
There was a sudden rustling noise above them, and a hundred
owls came soaring through the open windows carrying the morning
mail. Instinctively, Harry looked up, but there was no sign of white
among the mass of brown and gray. The owls circled the tables, looking for the people to whom their letters and packages were addressed. A large tawny owl soared down to Neville Longbottom and
deposited a parcel into his lap — Neville almost always forgot to
pack something. On the other side of the Hall Draco Malfoy’s eagle
owl had landed on his shoulder, carrying what looked like his usual
supply of sweets and cakes from home. Trying to ignore the sinking
feeling of disappointment in his stomach, Harry returned to his porridge. Was it possible that something had happened to Hedwig, and
that Sirius hadn’t even got his letter?
His preoccupation lasted all the way across the sodden vegetable
patch until they arrived in greenhouse three, but here he was distracted by Professor Sprout showing the class the ugliest plants
Harry had ever seen. Indeed, they looked less like plants than
thick, black, giant slugs, protruding vertically out of the soil. Each
was squirming slightly and had a number of large, shiny swellings
upon it, which appeared to be full of liquid.
“Bubotubers,” Professor Sprout told them briskly. “They need
squeezing. You will collect the pus —”


194



MAD-EYE MOODY
“The what?” said Seamus Finnigan, sounding revolted.
“Pus, Finnigan, pus,” said Professor Sprout, “and it’s extremely
valuable, so don’t waste it. You will collect the pus, I say, in these
bottles. Wear your dragon-hide gloves; it can do funny things to
the skin when undiluted, bubotuber pus.”
Squeezing the bubotubers was disgusting, but oddly satisfying.
As each swelling was popped, a large amount of thick yellowishgreen liquid burst forth, which smelled strongly of petrol. They
caught it in the bottles as Professor Sprout had indicated, and by
the end of the lesson had collected several pints.
“This’ll keep Madam Pomfrey happy,” said Professor Sprout,
stoppering the last bottle with a cork. “An excellent remedy for the
more stubborn forms of acne, bubotuber pus. Should stop students
resorting to desperate measures to rid themselves of pimples.”
“Like poor Eloise Midgen,” said Hannah Abbott, a Hufflepuff,
in a hushed voice. “She tried to curse hers off.”
“Silly girl,” said Professor Sprout, shaking her head. “But
Madam Pomfrey fixed her nose back on in the end.”
A booming bell echoed from the castle across the wet grounds,
signaling the end of the lesson, and the class separated; the Hufflepuffs climbing the stone steps for Transfiguration, and the
Gryffindors heading in the other direction, down the sloping lawn
toward Hagrid’s small wooden cabin, which stood on the edge of
the Forbidden Forest.
Hagrid was standing outside his hut, one hand on the collar of
his enormous black boarhound, Fang. There were several open
wooden crates on the ground at his feet, and Fang was whimpering
and straining at his collar, apparently keen to investigate the contents more closely. As they drew nearer, an odd rattling noise


195



CHAPTER THIRTEEN
reached their ears, punctuated by what sounded like minor
explosions.
“Mornin’!” Hagrid said, grinning at Harry, Ron, and Hermione.
“Be’er wait fer the Slytherins, they won’ want ter miss this — BlastEnded Skrewts!”
“Come again?” said Ron.
Hagrid pointed down into the crates.
“Eurgh!” squealed Lavender Brown, jumping backward.
“Eurgh” just about summed up the Blast-Ended Skrewts in
Harry’s opinion. They looked like deformed, shell-less lobsters,
horribly pale and slimy-looking, with legs sticking out in very odd
places and no visible heads. There were about a hundred of them in
each crate, each about six inches long, crawling over one another,
bumping blindly into the sides of the boxes. They were giving off a
very powerful smell of rotting fish. Every now and then, sparks
would fly out of the end of a skrewt, and with a small phut, it
would be propelled forward several inches.
“On’y jus’ hatched,” said Hagrid proudly, “so yeh’ll be able ter
raise ’em yerselves! Thought we’d make a bit of a project of it!”
“And why would we want to raise them?” said a cold voice.
The Slytherins had arrived. The speaker was Draco Malfoy.
Crabbe and Goyle were chuckling appreciatively at his words.
Hagrid looked stumped at the question.
“I mean, what do they do?” asked Malfoy. “What is the point of
them?”
Hagrid opened his mouth, apparently thinking hard; there was a
few seconds’ pause, then he said roughly, “Tha’s next lesson, Malfoy. Yer jus’ feedin’ ’em today. Now, yeh’ll wan’ ter try ’em on a few
diff ’rent things — I’ve never had ’em before, not sure what they’ll

MAD-EYE MOODY
go fer — I got ant eggs an’ frog livers an’ a bit o’ grass snake — just
try ’em out with a bit of each.”
“First pus and now this,” muttered Seamus.
Nothing but deep affection for Hagrid could have made Harry,
Ron, and Hermione pick up squelchy handfuls of frog liver and
lower them into the crates to tempt the Blast-Ended Skrewts. Harry
couldn’t suppress the suspicion that the whole thing was entirely
pointless, because the skrewts didn’t seem to have mouths.
“Ouch!” yelled Dean Thomas after about ten minutes. “It got
me!
Hagrid hurried over to him, looking anxious.
“Its end exploded!” said Dean angrily, showing Hagrid a burn
on his hand.
“Ah, yeah, that can happen when they blast off,” said Hagrid,
nodding.
“Eurgh!” said Lavender Brown again. “Eurgh, Hagrid, what’s
that pointy thing on it?”
“Ah, some of ’em have got stings,” said Hagrid enthusiastically
(Lavender quickly withdrew her hand from the box). “I reckon
they’re the males. . . . The females’ve got sorta sucker things on
their bellies. . . . I think they might be ter suck blood.”
“Well, I can certainly see why we’re trying to keep them alive,”
said Malfoy sarcastically. “Who wouldn’t want pets that can burn,
sting, and bite all at once?”
“Just because they’re not very pretty, it doesn’t mean they’re not
useful,” Hermione snapped. “Dragon blood’s amazingly magical,
but you wouldn’t want a dragon for a pet, would you?”
Harry and Ron grinned at Hagrid, who gave them a furtive
smile from behind his bushy beard. Hagrid would have liked


197



CHAPTER THIRTEEN
nothing better than a pet dragon, as Harry, Ron, and Hermione
knew only too well — he had owned one for a brief period during
their first year, a vicious Norwegian Ridgeback by the name of
Norbert. Hagrid simply loved monstrous creatures, the more
lethal, the better.
“Well, at least the skrewts are small,” said Ron as they made their
way back up to the castle for lunch an hour later.
“They are now,” said Hermione in an exasperated voice, “but
once Hagrid’s found out what they eat, I expect they’ll be six feet
long.”
“Well, that won’t matter if they turn out to cure seasickness or
something, will it?” said Ron, grinning slyly at her.
“You know perfectly well I only said that to shut Malfoy up,”
said Hermione. “As a matter of fact I think he’s right. The best
thing to do would be to stamp on the lot of them before they start
attacking us all.”
They sat down at the Gryffindor table and helped themselves to
lamb chops and potatoes. Hermione began to eat so fast that Harry
and Ron stared at her.
“Er — is this the new stand on elf rights?” said Ron. “You’re going to make yourself puke instead?”
“No,” said Hermione, with as much dignity as she could muster
with her mouth bulging with sprouts. “I just want to get to the
library.”
“What?” said Ron in disbelief. “Hermione — it’s the first day
back! We haven’t even got homework yet!”
Hermione shrugged and continued to shovel down her food as
though she had not eaten for days. Then she leapt to her feet, said,
“See you at dinner!” and departed at high speed.

When the bell rang to signal the start of afternoon lessons,
Harry and Ron set off for North Tower where, at the top of a
tightly spiraling staircase, a silver stepladder led to a circular trapdoor in the ceiling, and the room where Professor Trelawney lived.
The familiar sweet perfume spreading from the fire met their
nostrils as they emerged at the top of the stepladder. As ever, the
curtains were all closed; the circular room was bathed in a dim reddish light cast by the many lamps, which were all draped with
scarves and shawls. Harry and Ron walked through the mass of
occupied chintz chairs and poufs that cluttered the room, and sat
down at the same small circular table.
“Good day,” said the misty voice of Professor Trelawney right
behind Harry, making him jump.
A very thin woman with enormous glasses that made her eyes
appear far too large for her face, Professor Trelawney was peering
down at Harry with the tragic expression she always wore whenever
she saw him. The usual large amount of beads, chains, and bangles
glittered upon her person in the firelight.
“You are preoccupied, my dear,” she said mournfully to Harry.
“My inner eye sees past your brave face to the troubled soul within.
And I regret to say that your worries are not baseless. I see difficult
times ahead for you, alas . . . most difficult . . . I fear the thing you
dread will indeed come to pass . . . and perhaps sooner than you
think. . . .”
Her voice dropped almost to a whisper. Ron rolled his eyes at
Harry, who looked stonily back. Professor Trelawney swept past
them and seated herself in a large winged armchair before the fire,
facing the class. Lavender Brown and Parvati Patil, who deeply admired Professor Trelawney, were sitting on poufs very close to her.

“My dears, it is time for us to consider the stars,” she said. “The
movements of the planets and the mysterious portents they reveal
only to those who understand the steps of the celestial dance. Human destiny may be deciphered by the planetary rays, which
intermingle . . .”
But Harry’s thoughts had drifted. The perfumed fire always
made him feel sleepy and dull-witted, and Professor Trelawney’s
rambling talks on fortune-telling never held him exactly spellbound — though he couldn’t help thinking about what she had just
said to him. “ ‘I fear the thing you dread will indeed come to pass . . .’ ”

Cedric. “Only you said this morning you’d have done it last night,
and no one would’ve seen you. . . . I’m not stupid, you know.”
“You’re doing a really good impression of it,” Harry snapped.
“Yeah?” said Ron, and there was no trace of a grin, forced or otherwise, on his face now. “You want to get to bed, Harry. I expect
you’ll need to be up early tomorrow for a photo-call or something.”
He wrenched the hangings shut around his four-poster, leaving
Harry standing there by the door, staring at the dark red velvet curtains, now hiding one of the few people he had been sure would believe him.

hen Harry woke up on Sunday morning, it took him a
moment to remember why he felt so miserable and worried. Then the memory of the previous night rolled over him. He
sat up and ripped back the curtains of his own four-poster, intending to talk to Ron, to force Ron to believe him — only to find that
Ron’s bed was empty; he had obviously gone down to breakfast.
Harry dressed and went down the spiral staircase into the common room. The moment he appeared, the people who had already
finished breakfast broke into applause again. The prospect of going
down into the Great Hall and facing the rest of the Gryffindors, all
treating him like some sort of hero, was not inviting; it was that,
however, or stay here and allow himself to be cornered by the
Creevey brothers, who were both beckoning frantically to him to
join them. He walked resolutely over to the portrait hole, pushed
it open, climbed out of it, and found himself face-to-face with
Hermione.

“Hello,” she said, holding up a stack of toast, which she was carrying in a napkin. “I brought you this. . . . Want to go for a walk?”
“Good idea,” said Harry gratefully.
They went downstairs, crossed the entrance hall quickly without
looking in at the Great Hall, and were soon striding across the lawn
toward the lake, where the Durmstrang ship was moored, reflected
blackly in the water. It was a chilly morning, and they kept moving,
munching their toast, as Harry told Hermione exactly what had
happened after he had left the Gryffindor table the night before. To
his immense relief, Hermione accepted his story without question.
“Well, of course I knew you hadn’t entered yourself,” she said when
he’d finished telling her about the scene in the chamber off the Hall.
“The look on your face when Dumbledore read out your name! But
the question is, who did put it in? Because Moody’s right, Harry . . .
I don’t think any student could have done it . . . they’d never be able
to fool the Goblet, or get over Dumbledore’s —”
“Have you seen Ron?” Harry interrupted.
Hermione hesitated.
“Erm . . . yes . . . he was at breakfast,” she said.
“Does he still think I entered myself?”
“Well . . . no, I don’t think so . . . not really,” said Hermione
awkwardly.
“What’s that supposed to mean, ‘not really’?”
“Oh Harry, isn’t it obvious?” Hermione said despairingly. “He’s
jealous!”
“Jealous?” Harry said incredulously. “Jealous of what? He wants to
make a prat of himself in front of the whole school, does he?”
“Look,” said Hermione patiently, “it’s always you who gets all
the attention, you know it is. I know it’s not your fault,” she added


CHAPTER EIGHTEEN
quickly, seeing Harry open his mouth furiously. “I know you don’t
ask for it . . . but — well — you know, Ron’s got all those brothers
to compete against at home, and you’re his best friend, and you’re
really famous — he’s always shunted to one side whenever people
see you, and he puts up with it, and he never mentions it, but I
suppose this is just one time too many. . . .”
“Great,” said Harry bitterly. “Really great. Tell him from me I’ll
swap any time he wants. Tell him from me he’s welcome to it. . . .
People gawping at my forehead everywhere I go. . . .”
“I’m not telling him anything,” Hermione said shortly. “Tell
him yourself. It’s the only way to sort this out.”
“I’m not running around after him trying to make him grow
up!” Harry said, so loudly that several owls in a nearby tree took
flight in alarm. “Maybe he’ll believe I’m not enjoying myself once
I’ve got my neck broken or —”
“That’s not funny,” said Hermione quietly. “That’s not funny at
all.” She looked extremely anxious. “Harry, I’ve been thinking —
you know what we’ve got to do, don’t you? Straight away, the moment we get back to the castle?”
“Yeah, give Ron a good kick up the —”
“Write to Sirius. You’ve got to tell him what’s happened. He
asked you to keep him posted on everything that’s going on at
Hogwarts. . . . It’s almost as if he expected something like this to
happen. I brought some parchment and a quill out with me —”
“Come off it,” said Harry, looking around to check that they
couldn’t be overheard, but the grounds were quite deserted. “He
came back to the country just because my scar twinged. He’ll probably come bursting right into the castle if I tell him someone’s entered me in the Triwizard Tournament —”




THE WEIGHING OF
THE WANDS
“He’d want you to tell him,” said Hermione sternly. “He’s going to
find out anyway —”
“How?”
“Harry, this isn’t going to be kept quiet,” said Hermione, very
seriously. “This tournament’s famous, and you’re famous. I’ll be
really surprised if there isn’t anything in the Daily Prophet about
you competing. . . . You’re already in half the books about YouKnow-Who, you know . . . and Sirius would rather hear it from
you, I know he would.”
“Okay, okay, I’ll write to him,” said Harry, throwing his last piece
of toast into the lake. They both stood and watched it floating there
for a moment, before a large tentacle rose out of the water and
scooped it beneath the surface. Then they returned to the castle.
“Whose owl am I going to use?” Harry said as they climbed the
stairs. “He told me not to use Hedwig again.”
“Ask Ron if you can borrow —”
“I’m not asking Ron for anything,” Harry said flatly.
“Well, borrow one of the school owls, then, anyone can use
them,” said Hermione.
They went up to the Owlery Hermione gave Harry a piece of
parchment, a quill, and a bottle of ink, then strolled around the
long lines of perches, looking at all the different owls, while Harry
sat down against a wall and wrote his letter.
Dear Sirius,
You told me to keep you posted on what’s happening at Hogwarts, so here goes — I don’t know if you’ve heard, but the Triwizard Tournament’s happening this year and on Saturday
night I got picked as a fourth champion. I don’t know who put my


291



CHAPTER EIGHTEEN
name in the Goblet of Fire, because I didn’t. The other Hogwarts champion is Cedric Diggory, from Hufflepuff.
He paused at this point, thinking. He had an urge to say something about the large weight of anxiety that seemed to have settled
inside his chest since last night, but he couldn’t think how to translate this into words, so he simply dipped his quill back into the ink
bottle and wrote,
Hope you’re okay, and Buckbeak —
“Finished,” he told Hermione, getting to his feet and brushing
straw off his robes. At this, Hedwig came fluttering down onto his
shoulder and held out her leg.
“I can’t use you,” Harry told her, looking around for the school
owls. “I’ve got to use one of these. . . .”
Hedwig gave a very loud hoot and took off so suddenly that her
talons cut into his shoulder. She kept her back to Harry all the time
he was tying his letter to the leg of a large barn owl. When the barn
owl had flown off, Harry reached out to stroke Hedwig, but she
clicked her beak furiously and soared up into the rafters out of
reach.
“First Ron, then you,” said Harry angrily. “This isn’t my fault.”
If Harry had thought that matters would improve once everyone
got used to the idea of him being champion, the following day
showed him how mistaken he was. He could no longer avoid the
rest of the school once he was back at lessons — and it was clear
that the rest of the school, just like the Gryffindors, thought Harry


292



THE WEIGHING OF
THE WANDS
had entered himself for the tournament. Unlike the Gryffindors,
however, they did not seem impressed.
The Hufflepuffs, who were usually on excellent terms with the
Gryffindors, had turned remarkably cold toward the whole lot of
them. One Herbology lesson was enough to demonstrate this. It
was plain that the Hufflepuffs felt that Harry had stolen their
champion’s glory; a feeling exacerbated, perhaps, by the fact that
Hufflepuff House very rarely got any glory, and that Cedric was
one of the few who had ever given them any, having beaten
Gryffindor once at Quidditch. Ernie Macmillan and Justin FinchFletchley, with whom Harry normally got on very well, did not talk
to him even though they were repotting Bouncing Bulbs at the
same tray — though they did laugh rather unpleasantly when one
of the Bouncing Bulbs wriggled free from Harry’s grip and
smacked him hard in the face. Ron wasn’t talking to Harry either.
Hermione sat between them, making very forced conversation, but
though both answered her normally, they avoided making eye contact with each other. Harry thought even Professor Sprout seemed
distant with him — but then, she was Head of Hufflepuff House.
He would have been looking forward to seeing Hagrid under
normal circumstances, but Care of Magical Creatures meant seeing
the Slytherins too — the first time he would come face-to-face
with them since becoming champion.
Predictably, Malfoy arrived at Hagrid’s cabin with his familiar
sneer firmly in place.
“Ah, look, boys, it’s the champion,” he said to Crabbe and Goyle
the moment he got within earshot of Harry. “Got your autograph
books? Better get a signature now, because I doubt he’s going to
be around much longer. . . . Half the Triwizard champions have


293



CHAPTER EIGHTEEN
died . . . how long d’you reckon you’re going to last, Potter? Ten
minutes into the first task’s my bet.”
Crabbe and Goyle guffawed sycophantically, but Malfoy had to
stop there, because Hagrid emerged from the back of his cabin
balancing a teetering tower of crates, each containing a very large
Blast-Ended Skrewt. To the class’s horror, Hagrid proceeded to explain that the reason the skrewts had been killing one another was
an excess of pent-up energy, and that the solution would be for
each student to fix a leash on a skrewt and take it for a short walk.
The only good thing about this plan was that it distracted Malfoy
completely.
“Take this thing for a walk?” he repeated in disgust, staring into
one of the boxes. “And where exactly are we supposed to fix the
leash? Around the sting, the blasting end, or the sucker?”
“Roun’ the middle,” said Hagrid, demonstrating. “Er — yeh
might want ter put on yer dragon-hide gloves, jus’ as an extra precaution, like. Harry — you come here an’ help me with this big
one. . . .”
Hagrid’s real intention, however, was to talk to Harry away from
the rest of the class. He waited until everyone else had set off with
their skrewts, then turned to Harry and said, very seriously, “So —
yer competin’, Harry. In the tournament. School champion.”
“One of the champions,” Harry corrected him.
Hagrid’s beetle-black eyes looked very anxious under his wild
eyebrows.
“No idea who put yeh in fer it, Harry?”
“You believe I didn’t do it, then?” said Harry, concealing with
difficulty the rush of gratitude he felt at Hagrid’s words.


294



THE WEIGHING OF
THE WANDS
“ ’Course I do,” Hagrid grunted. “Yeh say it wasn’ you, an’ I believe yeh — an’ Dumbledore believes yer, an’ all.”
“Wish I knew who did do it,” said Harry bitterly.
The pair of them looked out over the lawn; the class was widely
scattered now, and all in great difficulty. The skrewts were now over
three feet long, and extremely powerful. No longer shell-less and
colorless, they had developed a kind of thick, grayish, shiny armor.
They looked like a cross between giant scorpions and elongated
crabs — but still without recognizable heads or eyes. They had become immensely strong and very hard to control.
“Look like they’re havin’ fun, don’ they?” Hagrid said happily.
Harry assumed he was talking about the skrewts, because his classmates certainly weren’t; every now and then, with an alarming
bang, one of the skrewts’ ends would explode, causing it to shoot
forward several yards, and more than one person was being dragged
along on their stomach, trying desperately to get back on their feet.
“Ah, I don’ know, Harry,” Hagrid sighed suddenly, looking back
down at him with a worried expression on his face. “School champion . . . everythin’ seems ter happen ter you, doesn’ it?”
Harry didn’t answer. Yes, everything did seem to happen to
him . . . that was more or less what Hermione had said as they had
walked around the lake, and that was the reason, according to her,
that Ron was no longer talking to him.
The next few days were some of Harry’s worst at Hogwarts. The
closest he had ever come to feeling like this had been during those
months, in his second year, when a large part of the school had suspected him of attacking his fellow students. But Ron had been on


295



CHAPTER EIGHTEEN
his side then. He thought he could have coped with the rest of the
school’s behavior if he could just have had Ron back as a friend, but
he wasn’t going to try and persuade Ron to talk to him if Ron didn’t
want to. Nevertheless, it was lonely with dislike pouring in on him
from all sides.
He could understand the Hufflepuffs’ attitude, even if he didn’t
like it; they had their own champion to support. He expected
nothing less than vicious insults from the Slytherins — he was
highly unpopular there and always had been, because he had
helped Gryffindor beat them so often, both at Quidditch and in
the Inter-House Championship. But he had hoped the Ravenclaws
might have found it in their hearts to support him as much as
Cedric. He was wrong, however. Most Ravenclaws seemed to think
that he had been desperate to earn himself a bit more fame by tricking the goblet into accepting his name.
Then there was the fact that Cedric looked the part of a champion so much more than he did. Exceptionally handsome, with his
straight nose, dark hair, and gray eyes, it was hard to say who was
receiving more admiration these days, Cedric or Viktor Krum.
Harry actually saw the same sixth-year girls who had been so keen
to get Krum’s autograph begging Cedric to sign their school bags
one lunchtime.
Meanwhile there was no reply from Sirius, Hedwig was refusing
to come anywhere near him, Professor Trelawney was predicting his
death with even more certainty than usual, and he did so badly at
Summoning Charms in Professor Flitwick’s class that he was given
extra homework — the only person to get any, apart from Neville.
“It’s really not that difficult, Harry,” Hermione tried to reassure
him as they left Flitwick’s class — she had been making objects

zoom across the room to her all lesson, as though she were some
sort of weird magnet for board dusters, wastepaper baskets, and
lunascopes. “You just weren’t concentrating properly —”
“Wonder why that was,” said Harry darkly as Cedric Diggory
walked past, surrounded by a large group of simpering girls, all of
whom looked at Harry as though he were a particularly large BlastEnded Skrewt. “Still — never mind, eh? Double Potions to look
forward to this afternoon. . . .”
Double Potions was always a horrible experience, but these days
it was nothing short of torture. Being shut in a dungeon for an
hour and a half with Snape and the Slytherins, all of whom seemed
determined to punish Harry as much as possible for daring to become school champion, was about the most unpleasant thing
Harry could imagine. He had already struggled through one Friday’s worth, with Hermione sitting next to him intoning “ignore
them, ignore them, ignore them” under her breath, and he couldn’t see why today should be any better.
When he and Hermione arrived at Snape’s dungeon after lunch,
they found the Slytherins waiting outside, each and every one of
them wearing a large badge on the front of his or her robes. For one
wild moment Harry thought they were S.P.E.W. badges — then he
saw that they all bore the same message, in luminous red letters
that burnt brightly in the dimly lit underground passage:

“Like them, Potter?” said Malfoy loudly as Harry approached.
“And this isn’t all they do — look!”


CHAPTER EIGHTEEN
He pressed his badge into his chest, and the message upon it
vanished, to be replaced by another one, which glowed green:

The Slytherins howled with laughter. Each of them pressed
their badges too, until the message POTTER STINKS was shining brightly all around Harry. He felt the heat rise in his face and
neck.
“Oh very funny,” Hermione said sarcastically to Pansy Parkinson
and her gang of Slytherin girls, who were laughing harder than
anyone, “really witty.”
Ron was standing against the wall with Dean and Seamus. He
wasn’t laughing, but he wasn’t sticking up for Harry either.
“Want one, Granger?” said Malfoy, holding out a badge to
Hermione. “I’ve got loads. But don’t touch my hand, now. I’ve just
washed it, you see; don’t want a Mudblood sliming it up.”
Some of the anger Harry had been feeling for days and days
seemed to burst through a dam in his chest. He had reached for his
wand before he’d thought what he was doing. People all around
them scrambled out of the way, backing down the corridor.
“Harry!” Hermione said warningly.
“Go on, then, Potter,” Malfoy said quietly, drawing out his own
wand. “Moody’s not here to look after you now — do it, if you’ve
got the guts —”
For a split second, they looked into each other’s eyes, then, at exactly the same time, both acted.
“Furnunculus!” Harry yelled.


THE WEIGHING OF
THE WANDS
“Densaugeo!” screamed Malfoy.
Jets of light shot from both wands, hit each other in midair, and
ricocheted off at angles — Harry’s hit Goyle in the face, and Malfoy’s hit Hermione. Goyle bellowed and put his hands to his nose,
where great ugly boils were springing up — Hermione, whimpering in panic, was clutching her mouth.
“Hermione!”
Ron had hurried forward to see what was wrong with her; Harry
turned and saw Ron dragging Hermione’s hand away from her
face. It wasn’t a pretty sight. Hermione’s front teeth — already
larger than average — were now growing at an alarming rate; she
was looking more and more like a beaver as her teeth elongated,
past her bottom lip, toward her chin — panic-stricken, she felt
them and let out a terrified cry.
“And what is all this noise about?” said a soft, deadly voice.
Snape had arrived. The Slytherins clamored to give their explanations; Snape pointed a long yellow finger at Malfoy and said,
“Explain.”
“Potter attacked me, sir —”
“We attacked each other at the same time!” Harry shouted.
“— and he hit Goyle — look —”
Snape examined Goyle, whose face now resembled something
that would have been at home in a book on poisonous fungi.
“Hospital wing, Goyle,” Snape said calmly.
“Malfoy got Hermione!” Ron said. “Look!”
He forced Hermione to show Snape her teeth — she was doing
her best to hide them with her hands, though this was difficult as
they had now grown down past her collar. Pansy Parkinson and the


CHAPTER EIGHTEEN
other Slytherin girls were doubled up with silent giggles, pointing
at Hermione from behind Snape’s back.
Snape looked coldly at Hermione, then said, “I see no
difference.”
Hermione let out a whimper; her eyes filled with tears, she
turned on her heel and ran, ran all the way up the corridor and out
of sight.
It was lucky, perhaps, that both Harry and Ron started shouting
at Snape at the same time; lucky their voices echoed so much in the
stone corridor, for in the confused din, it was impossible for him to
hear exactly what they were calling him. He got the gist, however.
“Let’s see,” he said, in his silkiest voice. “Fifty points from
Gryffindor and a detention each for Potter and Weasley. Now get
inside, or it’ll be a week’s worth of detentions.”
Harry’s ears were ringing. The injustice of it made him want to
curse Snape into a thousand slimy pieces. He passed Snape, walked
with Ron to the back of the dungeon, and slammed his bag down
onto the table. Ron was shaking with anger too — for a moment,
it felt as though everything was back to normal between them, but
then Ron turned and sat down with Dean and Seamus instead,
leaving Harry alone at his table. On the other side of the dungeon,
Malfoy turned his back on Snape and pressed his badge, smirking.
POTTER STINKS flashed once more across the room.
Harry sat there staring at Snape as the lesson began, picturing
horrific things happening to him. . . . If only he knew how to do
the Cruciatus Curse . . . he’d have Snape flat on his back like that
spider, jerking and twitching. . . .
“Antidotes!” said Snape, looking around at them all, his cold
black eyes glittering unpleasantly. “You should all have prepared


THE WEIGHING OF
THE WANDS
your recipes now. I want you to brew them carefully, and then, we
will be selecting someone on whom to test one. . . .”
Snape’s eyes met Harry’s, and Harry knew what was coming.
Snape was going to poison him. Harry imagined picking up his
cauldron, and sprinting to the front of the class, and bringing it
down on Snape’s greasy head —
And then a knock on the dungeon door burst in on Harry’s
thoughts.
It was Colin Creevey; he edged into the room, beaming at
Harry, and walked up to Snape’s desk at the front of the room.
“Yes?” said Snape curtly.
“Please, sir, I’m supposed to take Harry Potter upstairs.”
Snape stared down his hooked nose at Colin, whose smile faded
from his eager face.
“Potter has another hour of Potions to complete,” said Snape
coldly. “He will come upstairs when this class is finished.”
Colin went pink.
“Sir — sir, Mr. Bagman wants him,” he said nervously. “All the
champions have got to go, I think they want to take photographs. . . .”
Harry would have given anything he owned to have stopped
Colin saying those last few words. He chanced half a glance at Ron,
but Ron was staring determinedly at the ceiling.
“Very well, very well,” Snape snapped. “Potter, leave your things
here, I want you back down here later to test your antidote.”
“Please, sir — he’s got to take his things with him,” squeaked
Colin. “All the champions —”
“Very well !” said Snape. “Potter — take your bag and get out of
my sight!”


CHAPTER EIGHTEEN
Harry swung his bag over his shoulder, got up, and headed for
the door. As he walked through the Slytherin desks, POTTER
STINKS flashed at him from every direction.
“It’s amazing, isn’t it, Harry?” said Colin, starting to speak the
moment Harry had closed the dungeon door behind him. “Isn’t it,
though? You being champion?”
“Yeah, really amazing,” said Harry heavily as they set off toward
the steps into the entrance hall. “What do they want photos for,
Colin?”
“The Daily Prophet, I think!”
“Great,” said Harry dully. “Exactly what I need. More publicity.”
“Good luck!” said Colin when they had reached the right room.
Harry knocked on the door and entered.
He was in a fairly small classroom; most of the desks had been
pushed away to the back of the room, leaving a large space in the
middle; three of them, however, had been placed end-to-end in
front of the blackboard and covered with a long length of velvet.
Five chairs had been set behind the velvet-covered desks, and Ludo
Bagman was sitting in one of them, talking to a witch Harry had
never seen before, who was wearing magenta robes.
Viktor Krum was standing moodily in a corner as usual and not
talking to anybody. Cedric and Fleur were in conversation. Fleur
looked a good deal happier than Harry had seen her so far; she kept
throwing back her head so that her long silvery hair caught the
light. A paunchy man, holding a large black camera that was smoking slightly, was watching Fleur out of the corner of his eye.
Bagman suddenly spotted Harry, got up quickly, and bounded
forward.


THE WEIGHING OF
THE WANDS
“Ah, here he is! Champion number four! In you come, Harry, in
you come . . . nothing to worry about, it’s just the wand weighing
ceremony, the rest of the judges will be here in a moment —”
“Wand weighing?” Harry repeated nervously.
“We have to check that your wands are fully functional, no
problems, you know, as they’re your most important tools in the
tasks ahead,” said Bagman. “The expert’s upstairs now with Dumbledore. And then there’s going to be a little photo shoot. This is
Rita Skeeter,” he added, gesturing toward the witch in magenta
robes. “She’s doing a small piece on the tournament for the Daily
Prophet. . . .”
“Maybe not that small, Ludo,” said Rita Skeeter, her eyes on
Harry.
Her hair was set in elaborate and curiously rigid curls that contrasted oddly with her heavy-jawed face. She wore jeweled spectacles. The thick fingers clutching her crocodile-skin handbag ended
in two-inch nails, painted crimson.
“I wonder if I could have a little word with Harry before we
start?” she said to Bagman, but still gazing fixedly at Harry. “The
youngest champion, you know . . . to add a bit of color?”
“Certainly!” cried Bagman. “That is — if Harry has no objection?”
“Er —” said Harry.
“Lovely,” said Rita Skeeter, and in a second, her scarlet-taloned
fingers had Harry’s upper arm in a surprisingly strong grip, and
she was steering him out of the room again and opening a nearby
door.
“We don’t want to be in there with all that noise,” she said. “Let’s
see . . . ah, yes, this is nice and cozy.”
It was a broom cupboard. Harry stared at her.


303



CHAPTER EIGHTEEN
“Come along, dear — that’s right — lovely,” said Rita Skeeter
again, perching herself precariously upon an upturned bucket,
pushing Harry down onto a cardboard box, and closing the door,
throwing them into darkness. “Let’s see now . . .”
She unsnapped her crocodile-skin handbag and pulled out
a handful of candles, which she lit with a wave of her wand
and magicked into midair, so that they could see what they were
doing.
“You won’t mind, Harry, if I use a Quick-Quotes Quill? It leaves
me free to talk to you normally. . . .”
“A what?” said Harry.
Rita Skeeter’s smile widened. Harry counted three gold teeth.
She reached again into her crocodile bag and drew out a long acidgreen quill and a roll of parchment, which she stretched out
between them on a crate of Mrs. Skower’s All-Purpose Magical
Mess Remover. She put the tip of the green quill into her mouth,
sucked it for a moment with apparent relish, then placed it upright
on the parchment, where it stood balanced on its point, quivering
slightly.
“Testing . . . my name is Rita Skeeter, Daily Prophet reporter.”
Harry looked down quickly at the quill. The moment Rita
Skeeter had spoken, the green quill had started to scribble, skidding across the parchment:

Attractive blonde Rita Skeeter, forty-three, whose savage
quill has punctured many inflated reputations —
“Lovely,” said Rita Skeeter, yet again, and she ripped the top
piece of parchment off, crumpled it up, and stuffed it into her


304



THE WEIGHING OF
THE WANDS
handbag. Now she leaned toward Harry and said, “So, Harry . . .
what made you decide to enter the Triwizard Tournament?”
“Er —” said Harry again, but he was distracted by the quill.
Even though he wasn’t speaking, it was dashing across the parchment, and in its wake he could make out a fresh sentence:

An ugly scar, souvenir of a tragic past, disfigures the
otherwise charming face of Harry Potter, whose eyes —
“Ignore the quill, Harry,” said Rita Skeeter firmly. Reluctantly,
Harry looked up at her instead. “Now — why did you decide to
enter the tournament, Harry?”
“I didn’t,” said Harry. “I don’t know how my name got into the
Goblet of Fire. I didn’t put it in there.”
Rita Skeeter raised one heavily penciled eyebrow.
“Come now, Harry, there’s no need to be scared of getting into
trouble. We all know you shouldn’t really have entered at all. But
don’t worry about that. Our readers love a rebel.”
“But I didn’t enter,” Harry repeated. “I don’t know who —”
“How do you feel about the tasks ahead?” said Rita Skeeter.
“Excited? Nervous?”
“I haven’t really thought . . . yeah, nervous, I suppose,” said
Harry. His insides squirmed uncomfortably as he spoke.
“Champions have died in the past, haven’t they?” said Rita
Skeeter briskly. “Have you thought about that at all?”
“Well . . . they say it’s going to be a lot safer this year,” said
Harry.
The quill whizzed across the parchment between them, back
and forward as though it were skating.


305



CHAPTER EIGHTEEN
“Of course, you’ve looked death in the face before, haven’t you?”
said Rita Skeeter, watching him closely. “How would you say that’s
affected you?”
“Er,” said Harry, yet again.
“Do you think that the trauma in your past might have made
you keen to prove yourself? To live up to your name? Do you think
that perhaps you were tempted to enter the Triwizard Tournament
because —”
“I didn’t enter,” said Harry, starting to feel irritated.
“Can you remember your parents at all?” said Rita Skeeter, talking over him.
“No,” said Harry.
“How do you think they’d feel if they knew you were competing
in the Triwizard Tournament? Proud? Worried? Angry?”
Harry was feeling really annoyed now. How on earth was he to
know how his parents would feel if they were alive? He could feel
Rita Skeeter watching him very intently. Frowning, he avoided her
gaze and looked down at words the quill had just written:

Tears fill those startling green eyes as our conversation
turns to the parents he can barely remember.
“I have NOT got tears in my eyes!” said Harry loudly.
Before Rita Skeeter could say a word, the door of the broom
cupboard was pulled open. Harry looked around, blinking in the
bright light. Albus Dumbledore stood there, looking down at both
of them, squashed into the cupboard.
“Dumbledore!” cried Rita Skeeter, with every appearance of
delight — but Harry noticed that her quill and the parchment had

THE WEIGHING OF
THE WANDS
suddenly vanished from the box of Magical Mess Remover, and
Rita’s clawed fingers were hastily snapping shut the clasp of her
crocodile-skin bag. “How are you?” she said, standing up and holding out one of her large, mannish hands to Dumbledore. “I hope
you saw my piece over the summer about the International Confederation of Wizards’ Conference?”
“Enchantingly nasty,” said Dumbledore, his eyes twinkling. “I
particularly enjoyed your description of me as an obsolete dingbat.”
Rita Skeeter didn’t look remotely abashed.
“I was just making the point that some of your ideas are a little
old-fashioned, Dumbledore, and that many wizards in the street —”
“I will be delighted to hear the reasoning behind the rudeness,
Rita,” said Dumbledore, with a courteous bow and a smile, “but
I’m afraid we will have to discuss the matter later. The Weighing of
the Wands is about to start, and it cannot take place if one of our
champions is hidden in a broom cupboard.”
Very glad to get away from Rita Skeeter, Harry hurried back into
the room. The other champions were now sitting in chairs near the
door, and he sat down quickly next to Cedric, looking up at the
velvet-covered table, where four of the five judges were now sitting — Professor Karkaroff, Madame Maxime, Mr. Crouch, and
Ludo Bagman. Rita Skeeter settled herself down in a corner; Harry
saw her slip the parchment out of her bag again, spread it on her
knee, suck the end of the Quick-Quotes Quill, and place it once
more on the parchment.
“May I introduce Mr. Ollivander?” said Dumbledore, taking his
place at the judges’ table and talking to the champions. “He will be
checking your wands to ensure that they are in good condition before the tournament.”


307



CHAPTER EIGHTEEN
Harry looked around, and with a jolt of surprise saw an old wizard with large, pale eyes standing quietly by the window. Harry had
met Mr. Ollivander before — he was the wand-maker from whom
Harry had bought his own wand over three years ago in Diagon
Alley.
“Mademoiselle Delacour, could we have you first, please?” said
Mr. Ollivander, stepping into the empty space in the middle of the
room.
Fleur Delacour swept over to Mr. Ollivander and handed him
her wand.
“Hmmm . . .” he said.
He twirled the wand between his long fingers like a baton and it
emitted a number of pink and gold sparks. Then he held it close to
his eyes and examined it carefully.
“Yes,” he said quietly, “nine and a half inches . . . inflexible . . .
rosewood . . . and containing . . . dear me . . .”
“An ’air from ze ’ead of a veela,” said Fleur. “One of my
grandmuzzer’s.”
So Fleur was part veela, thought Harry, making a mental note to
tell Ron . . . then he remembered that Ron wasn’t speaking to him.
“Yes,” said Mr. Ollivander, “yes, I’ve never used veela hair myself, of course. I find it makes for rather temperamental wands . . .
however, to each his own, and if this suits you . . .”
Mr. Ollivander ran his fingers along the wand, apparently checking for scratches or bumps; then he muttered, “Orchideous!” and a
bunch of flowers burst from the wand tip.
“Very well, very well, it’s in fine working order,” said Mr. Ollivander, scooping up the flowers and handing them to Fleur with
her wand. “Mr. Diggory, you next.”


308



THE WEIGHING OF
THE WANDS
Fleur glided back to her seat, smiling at Cedric as he passed her.
“Ah, now, this is one of mine, isn’t it?” said Mr. Ollivander, with
much more enthusiasm, as Cedric handed over his wand. “Yes, I remember it well. Containing a single hair from the tail of a particularly fine male unicorn . . . must have been seventeen hands; nearly
gored me with his horn after I plucked his tail. Twelve and a quarter inches . . . ash . . . pleasantly springy. It’s in fine condition. . . .
You treat it regularly?”
“Polished it last night,” said Cedric, grinning.
Harry looked down at his own wand. He could see finger marks
all over it. He gathered a fistful of robe from his knee and tried to
rub it clean surreptitiously. Several gold sparks shot out of the end
of it. Fleur Delacour gave him a very patronizing look, and he
desisted.
Mr. Ollivander sent a stream of silver smoke rings across the
room from the tip of Cedric’s wand, pronounced himself satisfied,
and then said, “Mr. Krum, if you please.”
Viktor Krum got up and slouched, round-shouldered and duckfooted, toward Mr. Ollivander. He thrust out his wand and stood
scowling, with his hands in the pockets of his robes.
“Hmm,” said Mr. Ollivander, “this is a Gregorovitch creation,
unless I’m much mistaken? A fine wand-maker, though the styling
is never quite what I . . . however . . .”
He lifted the wand and examined it minutely, turning it over
and over before his eyes.
“Yes . . . hornbeam and dragon heartstring?” he shot at Krum,
who nodded. “Rather thicker than one usually sees . . . quite
rigid . . . ten and a quarter inches . . . Avis!”
The hornbeam wand let off a blast like a gun, and a number of


309



CHAPTER EIGHTEEN
small, twittering birds flew out of the end and through the open
window into the watery sunlight.
“Good,” said Mr. Ollivander, handing Krum back his wand.
“Which leaves . . . Mr. Potter.”
Harry got to his feet and walked past Krum to Mr. Ollivander.
He handed over his wand.
“Aaaah, yes,” said Mr. Ollivander, his pale eyes suddenly gleaming. “Yes, yes, yes. How well I remember.”
Harry could remember too. He could remember it as though it
had happened yesterday. . . .
Four summers ago, on his eleventh birthday, he had entered Mr.
Ollivander’s shop with Hagrid to buy a wand. Mr. Ollivander had
taken his measurements and then started handing him wands to
try. Harry had waved what felt like every wand in the shop, until at
last he had found the one that suited him — this one, which was
made of holly, eleven inches long, and contained a single feather
from the tail of a phoenix. Mr. Ollivander had been very surprised
that Harry had been so compatible with this wand. “Curious,” he
had said, “curious,” and not until Harry asked what was curious
had Mr. Ollivander explained that the phoenix feather in Harry’s
wand had come from the same bird that had supplied the core of
Lord Voldemort’s.
Harry had never shared this piece of information with anybody.
He was very fond of his wand, and as far as he was concerned its relation to Voldemort’s wand was something it couldn’t help —
rather as he couldn’t help being related to Aunt Petunia. However,
he really hoped that Mr. Ollivander wasn’t about to tell the room
about it. He had a funny feeling Rita Skeeter’s Quick-Quotes Quill
might just explode with excitement if he did.


310



THE WEIGHING OF
THE WANDS
Mr. Ollivander spent much longer examining Harry’s wand
than anyone else’s. Eventually, however, he made a fountain of
wine shoot out of it, and handed it back to Harry, announcing that
it was still in perfect condition.
“Thank you all,” said Dumbledore, standing up at the judges’
table. “You may go back to your lessons now — or perhaps it
would be quicker just to go down to dinner, as they are about to
end —”
Feeling that at last something had gone right today, Harry got
up to leave, but the man with the black camera jumped up and
cleared his throat.
“Photos, Dumbledore, photos!” cried Bagman excitedly. “All the
judges and champions, what do you think, Rita?”
“Er — yes, let’s do those first,” said Rita Skeeter, whose eyes
were upon Harry again. “And then perhaps some individual shots.”
The photographs took a long time. Madame Maxime cast everyone else into shadow wherever she stood, and the photographer
couldn’t stand far enough back to get her into the frame; eventually
she had to sit while everyone else stood around her. Karkaroff kept
twirling his goatee around his finger to give it an extra curl; Krum,
whom Harry would have thought would have been used to this
sort of thing, skulked, half-hidden, at the back of the group. The
photographer seemed keenest to get Fleur at the front, but Rita
Skeeter kept hurrying forward and dragging Harry into greater
prominence. Then she insisted on separate shots of all the champions. At last, they were free to go.
Harry went down to dinner. Hermione wasn’t there — he supposed she was still in the hospital wing having her teeth fixed. He
ate alone at the end of the table, then returned to Gryffindor


311



CHAPTER EIGHTEEN
Tower, thinking of all the extra work on Summoning Charms that
he had to do. Up in the dormitory, he came across Ron.
“You’ve had an owl,” said Ron brusquely the moment he walked
in. He was pointing at Harry’s pillow. The school barn owl was
waiting for him there.
“Oh — right,” said Harry.
“And we’ve got to do our detentions tomorrow night, Snape’s
dungeon,” said Ron.
He then walked straight out of the room, not looking at Harry.
For a moment, Harry considered going after him — he wasn’t sure
whether he wanted to talk to him or hit him, both seemed quite appealing — but the lure of Sirius’s answer was too strong. Harry
strode over to the barn owl, took the letter off its leg, and unrolled it.
Harry —
I can’t say everything I would like to in a letter, it’s too risky
in case the owl is intercepted — we need to talk face-to-face.
Can you ensure that you are alone by the fire in Gryffindor
Tower at one o’clock in the morning on the 22nd of November?
I know better than anyone that you can look after yourself
and while you’re around Dumbledore and Moody I don’t think
anyone will be able to hurt you. However, someone seems to be
having a good try. Entering you in that tournament would
have been very risky, especially right under Dumbledore’s nose.
Be on the watch, Harry. I still want to hear about anything
unusual. Let me know about the 22nd of November as quickly
as you can.

T

he prospect of talking face-to-face with Sirius was all that
sustained Harry over the next fortnight, the only bright spot
on a horizon that had never looked darker. The shock of finding
himself school champion had worn off slightly now, and the fear of
what was facing him had started to sink in. The first task was drawing steadily nearer; he felt as though it were crouching ahead of
him like some horrific monster, barring his path. He had never suffered nerves like these; they were way beyond anything he had experienced before a Quidditch match, not even his last one against
Slytherin, which had decided who would win the Quidditch Cup.
Harry was finding it hard to think about the future at all; he felt as
though his whole life had been leading up to, and would finish
with, the first task. . . .
Admittedly, he didn’t see how Sirius was going to make him feel
any better about having to perform an unknown piece of difficult
and dangerous magic in front of hundreds of people, but the mere


313



CHAPTER NINETEEN
sight of a friendly face would be something at the moment. Harry
wrote back to Sirius saying that he would be beside the common
room fire at the time Sirius had suggested, and he and Hermione
spent a long time going over plans for forcing any stragglers out of
the common room on the night in question. If the worst came to the
worst, they were going to drop a bag of Dungbombs, but they hoped
they wouldn’t have to resort to that — Filch would skin them alive.
In the meantime, life became even worse for Harry within the
confines of the castle, for Rita Skeeter had published her piece
about the Triwizard Tournament, and it had turned out to be not
so much a report on the tournament as a highly colored life story
of Harry. Much of the front page had been given over to a picture
of Harry; the article (continuing on pages two, six, and seven) had
been all about Harry, the names of the Beauxbatons and Durmstrang champions (misspelled) had been squashed into the last line
of the article, and Cedric hadn’t been mentioned at all.
The article had appeared ten days ago, and Harry still got a sick,
burning feeling of shame in his stomach every time he thought
about it. Rita Skeeter had reported him saying an awful lot of
things that he couldn’t remember ever saying in his life, let alone in
that broom cupboard.
I suppose I get my strength from my parents. I
know they’d be very proud of me if they could see
me now. . . . Yes, sometimes at night I still cry
about them, I’m not ashamed to admit it. . . . I
know nothing will hurt me during the tournament,
because they’re watching over me. . . .


THE HUNGARIAN
HORNTAIL
But Rita Skeeter had gone even further than transforming his
“er’s” into long, sickly sentences: She had interviewed other people
about him too.
Harry has at last found love at Hogwarts. His close
friend, Colin Creevey, says that Harry is rarely seen
out of the company of one Hermione Granger, a
stunningly pretty Muggle-born girl who, like Harry,
is one of the top students in the school.
From the moment the article had appeared, Harry had had to
endure people — Slytherins, mainly — quoting it at him as he
passed and making sneering comments.
“Want a hanky, Potter, in case you start crying in Transfiguration?”
“Since when have you been one of the top students in the
school, Potter? Or is this a school you and Longbottom have set up
together?”
“Hey — Harry!”
“Yeah, that’s right!” Harry found himself shouting as he wheeled
around in the corridor, having had just about enough. “I’ve just
been crying my eyes out over my dead mum, and I’m just off to do
a bit more. . . .”
“No — it was just — you dropped your quill.”
It was Cho. Harry felt the color rising in his face.
“Oh — right — sorry,” he muttered, taking the quill back.
“Er . . . good luck on Tuesday,” she said. “I really hope you do
well.”

CHAPTER NINETEEN
Which left Harry feeling extremely stupid
Hermione had come in for her fair share of unpleasantness too,
but she hadn’t yet started yelling at innocent bystanders; in fact,
Harry was full of admiration for the way she was handling the
situation.
“Stunningly pretty? Her?” Pansy Parkinson had shrieked the first
time she had come face-to-face with Hermione after Rita’s article
had appeared. “What was she judging against — a chipmunk?”
“Ignore it,” Hermione said in a dignified voice, holding her head
in the air and stalking past the sniggering Slytherin girls as though
she couldn’t hear them. “Just ignore it, Harry.”
But Harry couldn’t ignore it. Ron hadn’t spoken to him at all
since he had told him about Snape’s detentions. Harry had half
hoped they would make things up during the two hours they were
forced to pickle rats’ brains in Snape’s dungeon, but that had been
the day Rita’s article had appeared, which seemed to have confirmed Ron’s belief that Harry was really enjoying all the attention.
Hermione was furious with the pair of them; she went from one
to the other, trying to force them to talk to each other, but Harry
was adamant: He would talk to Ron again only if Ron admitted
that Harry hadn’t put his name in the Goblet of Fire and apologized for calling him a liar.
“I didn’t start this,” Harry said stubbornly. “It’s his problem.”
“You miss him!” Hermione said impatiently. “And I know he
misses you —”
“Miss him?” said Harry. “I don’t miss him. . . .”
But this was a downright lie. Harry liked Hermione very much,
but she just wasn’t the same as Ron. There was much less laughter
and a lot more hanging around in the library when Hermione was


your best friend. Harry still hadn’t mastered Summoning Charms,
he seemed to have developed something of a block about them,
and Hermione insisted that learning the theory would help. They
consequently spent a lot of time poring over books during their
lunchtimes.
Viktor Krum was in the library an awful lot too, and Harry
wondered what he was up to. Was he studying, or was he looking
for things to help him through the first task? Hermione often complained about Krum being there — not that he ever bothered
them — but because groups of giggling girls often turned up to spy
on him from behind bookshelves, and Hermione found the noise
distracting.
“He’s not even good-looking!” she muttered angrily, glaring at
Krum’s sharp profile. “They only like him because he’s famous!
They wouldn’t look twice at him if he couldn’t do that WonkyFaint thing —”
“Wronski Feint,” said Harry, through gritted teeth. Quite apart
from liking to get Quidditch terms correct, it caused him another
pang to imagine Ron’s expression if he could have heard Hermione
talking about Wonky-Faints.
It is a strange thing, but when you are dreading something, and
would give anything to slow down time, it has a disobliging habit
of speeding up. The days until the first task seemed to slip by as
though someone had fixed the clocks to work at double speed.
Harry’s feeling of barely controlled panic was with him wherever he
went, as everpresent as the snide comments about the Daily Prophet
article.
On the Saturday before the first task, all students in the third


CHAPTER NINETEEN
year and above were permitted to visit the village of Hogsmeade.
Hermione told Harry that it would do him good to get away from
the castle for a bit, and Harry didn’t need much persuasion.
“What about Ron, though?” he said. “Don’t you want to go with
him?”
“Oh . . . well . . .” Hermione went slightly pink. “I thought we
might meet up with him in the Three Broomsticks. . . .”
“No,” said Harry flatly.
“Oh Harry, this is so stupid —”
“I’ll come, but I’m not meeting Ron, and I’m wearing my Invisibility Cloak.”
“Oh all right then . . .” Hermione snapped, “but I hate talking
to you in that cloak, I never know if I’m looking at you or not.”
So Harry put on his Invisibility Cloak in the dormitory, went
back downstairs, and together he and Hermione set off for
Hogsmeade.
Harry felt wonderfully free under the cloak; he watched other
students walking past them as they entered the village, most of
them sporting Support Cedric Diggory! badges, but no horrible remarks came his way for a change, and nobody was quoting that
stupid article.
“People keep looking at me now,” said Hermione grumpily as
they came out of Honeydukes Sweetshop later, eating large creamfilled chocolates. “They think I’m talking to myself.”
“Don’t move your lips so much then.”
“Come on, please just take off your cloak for a bit, no one’s going to bother you here.”
“Oh yeah?” said Harry. “Look behind you.”
Rita Skeeter and her photographer friend had just emerged from


318



THE HUNGARIAN
HORNTAIL
the Three Broomsticks pub. Talking in low voices, they passed
right by Hermione without looking at her. Harry backed into the
wall of Honeydukes to stop Rita Skeeter from hitting him with her
crocodile-skin handbag. When they were gone, Harry said, “She’s
staying in the village. I bet she’s coming to watch the first task.”
As he said it, his stomach flooded with a wave of molten panic.
He didn’t mention this; he and Hermione hadn’t discussed what
was coming in the first task much; he had the feeling she didn’t
want to think about it.
“She’s gone,” said Hermione, looking right through Harry toward the end of the street. “Why don’t we go and have a butterbeer
in the Three Broomsticks, it’s a bit cold, isn’t it? You don’t have to
talk to Ron!” she added irritably, correctly interpreting his silence.
The Three Broomsticks was packed, mainly with Hogwarts students enjoying their free afternoon, but also with a variety of magical people Harry rarely saw anywhere else. Harry supposed that as
Hogsmeade was the only all-wizard village in Britain, it was a bit of
a haven for creatures like hags, who were not as adept as wizards at
disguising themselves.
It was very hard to move through crowds in the Invisibility
Cloak, in case you accidentally trod on someone, which tended to
lead to awkward questions. Harry edged slowly toward a spare
table in the corner while Hermione went to buy drinks. On his way
through the pub, Harry spotted Ron, who was sitting with Fred,
George, and Lee Jordan. Resisting the urge to give Ron a good hard
poke in the back of the head, he finally reached the table and sat
down at it.
Hermione joined him a moment later and slipped him a butterbeer under his cloak.


319



CHAPTER NINETEEN
“I look like such an idiot, sitting here on my own,” she muttered. “Lucky I brought something to do.”
And she pulled out a notebook in which she had been keeping a
record of S.P.E.W. members. Harry saw his and Ron’s names at the
top of the very short list. It seemed a long time ago that they had
sat making up those predictions together, and Hermione had
turned up and appointed them secretary and treasurer.
“You know, maybe I should try and get some of the villagers involved in S.P.E.W.,” Hermione said thoughtfully, looking around
the pub.
“Yeah, right,” said Harry. He took a swig of butterbeer under his
cloak. “Hermione, when are you going to give up on this spew
stuff?”
“When house-elves have decent wages and working conditions!”
she hissed back. “You know, I’m starting to think it’s time for more
direct action. I wonder how you get into the school kitchens?”
“No idea, ask Fred and George,” said Harry.
Hermione lapsed into thoughtful silence, while Harry drank his
butterbeer, watching the people in the pub. All of them looked
cheerful and relaxed. Ernie Macmillan and Hannah Abbot were
swapping Chocolate Frog cards at a nearby table; both of them
sporting Support Cedric Diggory! badges on their cloaks. Right over
by the door he saw Cho and a large group of her Ravenclaw
friends. She wasn’t wearing a Cedric badge though. . . . This
cheered up Harry very slightly. . . .
What wouldn’t he have given to be one of these people, sitting
around laughing and talking, with nothing to worry about but
homework? He imagined how it would have felt to be here if his
name hadn’t come out of the Goblet of Fire. He wouldn’t be


320

THE HUNGARIAN
HORNTAIL
wearing the Invisibility Cloak, for one thing. Ron would be sitting
with him. The three of them would probably be happily imagining
what deadly dangerous task the school champions would be facing
on Tuesday. He’d have been really looking forward to it, watching
them do whatever it was . . . cheering on Cedric with everyone
else, safe in a seat at the back of the stands. . . .
He wondered how the other champions were feeling. Every time
he had seen Cedric lately, he had been surrounded by admirers and
looking nervous but excited. Harry glimpsed Fleur Delacour from
time to time in the corridors; she looked exactly as she always did,
haughty and unruffled. And Krum just sat in the library, poring
over books.
Harry thought of Sirius, and the tight, tense knot in his chest
seemed to ease slightly. He would be speaking to him in just over
twelve hours, for tonight was the night they were meeting at the
common room fire — assuming nothing went wrong, as everything else had done lately. . . .
“Look, it’s Hagrid!” said Hermione.
The back of Hagrid’s enormous shaggy head — he had mercifully abandoned his bunches — emerged over the crowd. Harry
wondered why he hadn’t spotted him at once, as Hagrid was so
large, but standing up carefully, he saw that Hagrid had been leaning low, talking to Professor Moody. Hagrid had his usual enormous tankard in front of him, but Moody was drinking from his
hip flask. Madam Rosmerta, the pretty landlady, didn’t seem to
think much of this; she was looking askance at Moody as she collected glasses from tables around them. Perhaps she thought it was
an insult to her mulled mead, but Harry knew better. Moody had
told them all during their last Defense Against the Dark Arts lesson


321



CHAPTER NINETEEN
that he preferred to prepare his own food and drink at all times, as
it was so easy for Dark wizards to poison an unattended cup.
As Harry watched, he saw Hagrid and Moody get up to leave.
He waved, then remembered that Hagrid couldn’t see him. Moody,
however, paused, his magical eye on the corner where Harry was
standing. He tapped Hagrid in the small of the back (being unable
to reach his shoulder), muttered something to him, and then the
pair of them made their way back across the pub toward Harry and
Hermione’s table.
“All right, Hermione?” said Hagrid loudly.
“Hello,” said Hermione, smiling back.
Moody limped around the table and bent down; Harry thought
he was reading the S.P.E.W. notebook, until he muttered, “Nice
cloak, Potter.”
Harry stared at him in amazement. The large chunk missing
from Moody’s nose was particularly obvious at a few inches’ distance. Moody grinned.
“Can your eye — I mean, can you — ?”
“Yeah, it can see through Invisibility Cloaks,” Moody said quietly. “And it’s come in useful at times, I can tell you.”
Hagrid was beaming down at Harry too. Harry knew Hagrid
couldn’t see him, but Moody had obviously told Hagrid he was
there. Hagrid now bent down on the pretext of reading the
S.P.E.W. notebook as well, and said in a whisper so low that only
Harry could hear it, “Harry, meet me tonight at midnight at me
cabin. Wear that cloak.”
Straightening up, Hagrid said loudly, “Nice ter see yeh,
Hermione,” winked, and departed. Moody followed him.


THE HUNGARIAN
HORNTAIL
“Why does Hagrid want me to meet him at midnight?” Harry
said, very surprised.
“Does he?” said Hermione, looking startled. “I wonder what he’s
up to? I don’t know whether you should go, Harry. . . .” She looked
nervously around and hissed, “It might make you late for Sirius.”
It was true that going down to Hagrid’s at midnight would mean
cutting his meeting with Sirius very fine indeed; Hermione suggested sending Hedwig down to Hagrid’s to tell him he couldn’t
go — always assuming she would consent to take the note, of
course — Harry, however, thought it better just to be quick at whatever Hagrid wanted him for. He was very curious to know what this
might be; Hagrid had never asked Harry to visit him so late at night.
At half past eleven that evening, Harry, who had pretended to go
up to bed early, pulled the Invisibility Cloak back over himself and
crept back downstairs through the common room. Quite a few
people were still in there. The Creevey brothers had managed to get
hold of a stack of Support Cedric Diggory! badges and were trying to
bewitch them to make them say Support Harry Potter! instead. So
far, however, all they had managed to do was get the badges stuck
on POTTER STINKS. Harry crept past them to the portrait hole
and waited for a minute or so, keeping an eye on his watch. Then
Hermione opened the Fat Lady for him from outside as they had
planned. He slipped past her with a whispered “Thanks!” and set
off through the castle.
The grounds were very dark. Harry walked down the lawn toward
the lights shining in Hagrid’s cabin. The inside of the enormous
Beauxbatons carriage was also lit up; Harry could hear Madame
Maxime talking inside it as he knocked on Hagrid’s front door.


323



CHAPTER NINETEEN
“You there, Harry?” Hagrid whispered, opening the door and
looking around.
“Yeah,” said Harry, slipping inside the cabin and pulling the
cloak down off his head. “What’s up?”
“Got summat ter show yeh,” said Hagrid.
There was an air of enormous excitement about Hagrid. He was
wearing a flower that resembled an oversized artichoke in his buttonhole. It looked as though he had abandoned the use of axle
grease, but he had certainly attempted to comb his hair — Harry
could see the comb’s broken teeth tangled in it.
“What’re you showing me?” Harry said warily, wondering if the
skrewts had laid eggs, or Hagrid had managed to buy another giant
three-headed dog off a stranger in a pub.
“Come with me, keep quiet, an’ keep yerself covered with that
cloak,” said Hagrid. “We won’ take Fang, he won’ like it. . . .”
“Listen, Hagrid, I can’t stay long. . . . I’ve got to be back up at
the castle by one o’clock —”
But Hagrid wasn’t listening; he was opening the cabin door and
striding off into the night. Harry hurried to follow and found, to
his great surprise, that Hagrid was leading him to the Beauxbatons
carriage.
“Hagrid, what — ?”
“Shhh!” said Hagrid, and he knocked three times on the door
bearing the crossed golden wands.
Madame Maxime opened it. She was wearing a silk shawl wrapped
around her massive shoulders. She smiled when she saw Hagrid.
“Ah, ’Agrid . . . it is time?”
“Bong-sewer,” said Hagrid, beaming at her, and holding out a
hand to help her down the golden steps.


324



THE HUNGARIAN
HORNTAIL
Madame Maxime closed the door behind her, Hagrid offered her
his arm, and they set off around the edge of the paddock containing Madame Maxime’s giant winged horses, with Harry, totally
bewildered, running to keep up with them. Had Hagrid wanted to
show him Madame Maxime? He could see her any old time he
wanted . . . she wasn’t exactly hard to miss. . . .
But it seemed that Madame Maxime was in for the same treat as
Harry, because after a while she said playfully, “Wair is it you are
taking me, ’Agrid?”
“Yeh’ll enjoy this,” said Hagrid gruffly, “worth seein’, trust me.
On’y — don’ go tellin’ anyone I showed yeh, right? Yeh’re not
s’posed ter know.”
“Of course not,” said Madame Maxime, fluttering her long
black eyelashes.
And still they walked, Harry getting more and more irritated as
he jogged along in their wake, checking his watch every now and
then. Hagrid had some harebrained scheme in hand, which might
make him miss Sirius. If they didn’t get there soon, he was going to
turn around, go straight back to the castle, and leave Hagrid to enjoy his moonlit stroll with Madame Maxime. . . .
But then — when they had walked so far around the perimeter
of the forest that the castle and the lake were out of sight — Harry
heard something. Men were shouting up ahead . . . then came a
deafening, earsplitting roar. . . .
Hagrid led Madame Maxime around a clump of trees and came
to a halt. Harry hurried up alongside them — for a split second, he
thought he was seeing bonfires, and men darting around them —
and then his mouth fell open.
Dragons.


325



CHAPTER NINETEEN
Four fully grown, enormous, vicious-looking dragons were rearing onto their hind legs inside an enclosure fenced with thick planks
of wood, roaring and snorting — torrents of fire were shooting into
the dark sky from their open, fanged mouths, fifty feet above the
ground on their outstretched necks. There was a silvery-blue one
with long, pointed horns, snapping and snarling at the wizards on
the ground; a smooth-scaled green one, which was writhing and
stamping with all its might; a red one with an odd fringe of fine gold
spikes around its face, which was shooting mushroom-shaped fire
clouds into the air; and a gigantic black one, more lizard-like than
the others, which was nearest to them.
At least thirty wizards, seven or eight to each dragon, were
attempting to control them, pulling on the chains connected to
heavy leather straps around their necks and legs. Mesmerized,
Harry looked up, high above him, and saw the eyes of the black
dragon, with vertical pupils like a cat’s, bulging with either fear or
rage, he couldn’t tell which. . . . It was making a horrible noise, a
yowling, screeching scream. . . .
“Keep back there, Hagrid!” yelled a wizard near the fence, straining on the chain he was holding. “They can shoot fire at a range of
twenty feet, you know! I’ve seen this Horntail do forty!”
“Is’n’ it beautiful?” said Hagrid softly.
“It’s no good!” yelled another wizard. “Stunning Spells, on the
count of three!”
Harry saw each of the dragon keepers pull out his wand.
“Stupefy!” they shouted in unison, and the Stunning Spells shot
into the darkness like fiery rockets, bursting in showers of stars on
the dragons’ scaly hides —


THE HUNGARIAN
HORNTAIL
Harry watched the dragon nearest to them teeter dangerously on
its back legs; its jaws stretched wide in a silent howl; its nostrils
were suddenly devoid of flame, though still smoking — then, very
slowly, it fell. Several tons of sinewy, scaly-black dragon hit the
ground with a thud that Harry could have sworn made the trees
behind him quake.
The dragon keepers lowered their wands and walked forward to
their fallen charges, each of which was the size of a small hill. They
hurried to tighten the chains and fasten them securely to iron pegs,
which they forced deep into the ground with their wands.
“Wan’ a closer look?” Hagrid asked Madame Maxime excitedly.
The pair of them moved right up to the fence, and Harry followed.
The wizard who had warned Hagrid not to come any closer
turned, and Harry realized who it was: Charlie Weasley.
“All right, Hagrid?” he panted, coming over to talk. “They
should be okay now — we put them out with a Sleeping Draft on
the way here, thought it might be better for them to wake up in the
dark and the quiet — but, like you saw, they weren’t happy, not
happy at all —”
“What breeds you got here, Charlie?” said Hagrid, gazing at the
closest dragon, the black one, with something close to reverence.
Its eyes were still just open. Harry could see a strip of gleaming yellow beneath its wrinkled black eyelid.
“This is a Hungarian Horntail,” said Charlie. “There’s a Common Welsh Green over there, the smaller one — a Swedish ShortSnout, that blue-gray — and a Chinese Fireball, that’s the red.”
Charlie looked around; Madame Maxime was strolling away
around the edge of the enclosure, gazing at the stunned dragons.


327

CHAPTER NINETEEN
“I didn’t know you were bringing her, Hagrid,” Charlie said,
frowning. “The champions aren’t supposed to know what’s coming — she’s bound to tell her student, isn’t she?”
“Jus’ thought she’d like ter see ’em,” shrugged Hagrid, still gazing, enraptured, at the dragons.
“Really romantic date, Hagrid,” said Charlie, shaking his head.
“Four . . .” said Hagrid, “so it’s one fer each o’ the champions, is
it? What’ve they gotta do — fight ’em?”
“Just get past them, I think,” said Charlie. “We’ll be on hand if
it gets nasty, Extinguishing Spells at the ready. They wanted nesting mothers, I don’t know why . . . but I tell you this, I don’t envy
the one who gets the Horntail. Vicious thing. Its back end’s as dangerous as its front, look.”
Charlie pointed toward the Horntail’s tail, and Harry saw long,
bronze-colored spikes protruding along it every few inches.
Five of Charlie’s fellow keepers staggered up to the Horntail at
that moment, carrying a clutch of huge granite-gray eggs between
them in a blanket. They placed them carefully at the Horntail’s
side. Hagrid let out a moan of longing.
“I’ve got them counted, Hagrid,” said Charlie sternly. Then he
said, “How’s Harry?”
“Fine,” said Hagrid. He was still gazing at the eggs.
“Just hope he’s still fine after he’s faced this lot,” said Charlie
grimly, looking out over the dragons’ enclosure. “I didn’t dare tell
Mum what he’s got to do for the first task; she’s already having kittens about him. . . .” Charlie imitated his mother’s anxious voice.
“ ‘How could they let him enter that tournament, he’s much too young!
I thought they were all safe, I thought there was going to be an age

limit!’ She was in floods after that Daily Prophet article about him.
‘He still cries about his parents! Oh bless him, I never knew!’ ”
Harry had had enough. Trusting to the fact that Hagrid wouldn’t
miss him, with the attractions of four dragons and Madame
Maxime to occupy him, he turned silently and began to walk away,
back to the castle.
He didn’t know whether he was glad he’d seen what was coming
or not. Perhaps this way was better. The first shock was over now.
Maybe if he’d seen the dragons for the first time on Tuesday, he
would have passed out cold in front of the whole school . . . but
maybe he would anyway. . . . He was going to be armed with his
wand — which, just now, felt like nothing more than a narrow
strip of wood — against a fifty-foot-high, scaly, spike-ridden, firebreathing dragon. And he had to get past it. With everyone watching. How?
Harry sped up, skirting the edge of the forest; he had just under
fifteen minutes to get back to the fireside and talk to Sirius, and he
couldn’t remember, ever, wanting to talk to someone more than he
did right now — when, without warning, he ran into something
very solid.
Harry fell backward, his glasses askew, clutching the cloak around
him. A voice nearby said, “Ouch! Who’s there?”
Harry hastily checked that the cloak was covering him and lay
very still, staring up at the dark outline of the wizard he had hit. He
recognized the goatee . . . it was Karkaroff.
“Who’s there?” said Karkaroff again, very suspiciously, looking
around in the darkness. Harry remained still and silent. After a
minute or so, Karkaroff seemed to decide that he had hit some sort


329



CHAPTER NINETEEN
of animal; he was looking around at waist height, as though expecting to see a dog. Then he crept back under the cover of the
trees and started to edge forward toward the place where the dragons were.
Very slowly and very carefully, Harry got to his feet and set off
again as fast as he could without making too much noise, hurrying
through the darkness back toward Hogwarts.
He had no doubt whatsoever what Karkaroff was up to. He had
sneaked off his ship to try and find out what the first task was going
to be. He might even have spotted Hagrid and Madame Maxime
heading off around the forest together — they were hardly difficult
to spot at a distance . . . and now all Karkaroff had to do was follow the sound of voices, and he, like Madame Maxime, would
know what was in store for the champions.
By the looks of it, the only champion who would be facing the
unknown on Tuesday was Cedric.
Harry reached the castle, slipped in through the front doors, and
began to climb the marble stairs; he was very out of breath, but he
didn’t dare slow down. . . . He had less than five minutes to get up
to the fire. . . .
“Balderdash!” he gasped at the Fat Lady, who was snoozing in
her frame in front of the portrait hole.
“If you say so,” she muttered sleepily, without opening her eyes,
and the picture swung forward to admit him. Harry climbed inside. The common room was deserted, and, judging by the fact
that it smelled quite normal, Hermione had not needed to set off
any Dungbombs to ensure that he and Sirius got privacy.
Harry pulled off the Invisibility Cloak and threw himself into an
armchair in front of the fire. The room was in semidarkness; the


330



THE HUNGARIAN
HORNTAIL
flames were the only source of light. Nearby, on a table, the Support
Cedric Diggory! badges the Creeveys had been trying to improve
were glinting in the firelight. They now read POTTER REALLY
STINKS. Harry looked back into the flames, and jumped.
Sirius’s head was sitting in the fire. If Harry hadn’t seen Mr. Diggory do exactly this back in the Weasleys’ kitchen, it would have
scared him out of his wits. Instead, his face breaking into the first
smile he had worn for days, he scrambled out of his chair, crouched
down by the hearth, and said, “Sirius — how’re you doing?”
Sirius looked different from Harry’s memory of him. When they
had said good-bye, Sirius’s face had been gaunt and sunken, surrounded by a quantity of long, black, matted hair — but the hair
was short and clean now, Sirius’s face was fuller, and he looked
younger, much more like the only photograph Harry had of him,
which had been taken at the Potters’ wedding.
“Never mind me, how are you?” said Sirius seriously.
“I’m —” For a second, Harry tried to say “fine” — but he couldn’t
do it. Before he could stop himself, he was talking more than he’d
talked in days — about how no one believed he hadn’t entered the
tournament of his own free will, how Rita Skeeter had lied about
him in the Daily Prophet, how he couldn’t walk down a corridor
without being sneered at — and about Ron, Ron not believing him,
Ron’s jealousy . . .
“. . . and now Hagrid’s just shown me what’s coming in the first
task, and it’s dragons, Sirius, and I’m a goner,” he finished desperately.
Sirius looked at him, eyes full of concern, eyes that had not yet
lost the look that Azkaban had given them — that deadened,
haunted look. He had let Harry talk himself into silence without


331



CHAPTER NINETEEN
interruption, but now he said, “Dragons we can deal with, Harry,
but we’ll get to that in a minute — I haven’t got long here . . . I’ve
broken into a wizarding house to use the fire, but they could be
back at any time. There are things I need to warn you about.”
“What?” said Harry, feeling his spirits slip a further few
notches. . . . Surely there could be nothing worse than dragons
coming?
“Karkaroff,” said Sirius. “Harry, he was a Death Eater. You know
what Death Eaters are, don’t you?”
“Yes — he — what?”
“He was caught, he was in Azkaban with me, but he got released.
I’d bet everything that’s why Dumbledore wanted an Auror at
Hogwarts this year — to keep an eye on him. Moody caught
Karkaroff. Put him into Azkaban in the first place.”
“Karkaroff got released?” Harry said slowly — his brain seemed
to be struggling to absorb yet another piece of shocking information. “Why did they release him?”
“He did a deal with the Ministry of Magic,” said Sirius bitterly.
“He said he’d seen the error of his ways, and then he named
names . . . he put a load of other people into Azkaban in his
place. . . . He’s not very popular in there, I can tell you. And since
he got out, from what I can tell, he’s been teaching the Dark Arts
to every student who passes through that school of his. So watch
out for the Durmstrang champion as well.”
“Okay,” said Harry slowly. “But . . . are you saying Karkaroff
put my name in the goblet? Because if he did, he’s a really good
actor. He seemed furious about it. He wanted to stop me from
competing.”


332



THE HUNGARIAN
HORNTAIL
“We know he’s a good actor,” said Sirius, “because he convinced
the Ministry of Magic to set him free, didn’t he? Now, I’ve been
keeping an eye on the Daily Prophet, Harry —”
“— you and the rest of the world,” said Harry bitterly.
“— and reading between the lines of that Skeeter woman’s article last month, Moody was attacked the night before he started at
Hogwarts. Yes, I know she says it was another false alarm,” Sirius
said hastily, seeing Harry about to speak, “but I don’t think so,
somehow. I think someone tried to stop him from getting to Hogwarts. I think someone knew their job would be a lot more difficult
with him around. And no one’s going to look into it too closely;
Mad-Eye’s heard intruders a bit too often. But that doesn’t mean he
can’t still spot the real thing. Moody was the best Auror the Ministry ever had.”
“So . . . what are you saying?” said Harry slowly. “Karkaroff’s
trying to kill me? But — why?”
Sirius hesitated.
“I’ve been hearing some very strange things,” he said slowly.
“The Death Eaters seem to be a bit more active than usual lately.
They showed themselves at the Quidditch World Cup, didn’t they?
Someone set off the Dark Mark . . . and then — did you hear
about that Ministry of Magic witch who’s gone missing?”
“Bertha Jorkins?” said Harry.
“Exactly . . . she disappeared in Albania, and that’s definitely
where Voldemort was rumored to be last . . . and she would have
known the Triwizard Tournament was coming up, wouldn’t she?”
“Yeah, but . . . it’s not very likely she’d have walked straight into
Voldemort, is it?” said Harry.


333



CHAPTER NINETEEN
“Listen, I knew Bertha Jorkins,” said Sirius grimly. “She was
at Hogwarts when I was, a few years above your dad and me.
And she was an idiot. Very nosy, but no brains, none at all. It’s not
a good combination, Harry. I’d say she’d be very easy to lure into a
trap.
“So . . . so Voldemort could have found out about the tournament?” said Harry. “Is that what you mean? You think Karkaroff
might be here on his orders?”
“I don’t know,” said Sirius slowly, “I just don’t know . . .
Karkaroff doesn’t strike me as the type who’d go back to Voldemort
unless he knew Voldemort was powerful enough to protect him.
But whoever put your name in that goblet did it for a reason, and
I can’t help thinking the tournament would be a very good way to
attack you and make it look like an accident.”
“Looks like a really good plan from where I’m standing,” said
Harry grinning bleakly. “They’ll just have to stand back and let the
dragons do their stuff.”
“Right — these dragons,” said Sirius, speaking very quickly
now. “There’s a way, Harry. Don’t be tempted to try a Stunning
Spell — dragons are strong and too powerfully magical to be
knocked out by a single Stunner, you need about half a dozen wizards at a time to overcome a dragon —”
“Yeah, I know, I just saw,” said Harry.
“But you can do it alone,” said Sirius. “There is a way, and a simple spell’s all you need. Just —”
But Harry held up a hand to silence him, his heart suddenly
pounding as though it would burst. He could hear footsteps coming down the spiral staircase behind him.

THE HUNGARIAN
HORNTAIL
“Go!” he hissed at Sirius. “Go! There’s someone coming!”
Harry scrambled to his feet, hiding the fire — if someone saw
Sirius’s face within the walls of Hogwarts, they would raise an
almighty uproar — the Ministry would get dragged in — he,
Harry, would be questioned about Sirius’s whereabouts —
Harry heard a tiny pop! in the fire behind him and knew Sirius
had gone. He watched the bottom of the spiral staircase. Who had
decided to go for a stroll at one o’clock in the morning, and
stopped Sirius from telling him how to get past a dragon?
It was Ron. Dressed in his maroon paisley pajamas, Ron stopped
dead facing Harry across the room, and looked around.
“Who were you talking to?” he said.
“What’s that got to do with you?” Harry snarled. “What are you
doing down here at this time of night?”
“I just wondered where you —” Ron broke off, shrugging.
“Nothing. I’m going back to bed.”
“Just thought you’d come nosing around, did you?” Harry
shouted. He knew that Ron had no idea what he’d walked in on,
knew he hadn’t done it on purpose, but he didn’t care — at this
moment he hated everything about Ron, right down to the several
inches of bare ankle showing beneath his pajama trousers.
“Sorry about that,” said Ron, his face reddening with anger.
“Should’ve realized you didn’t want to be disturbed. I’ll let you get
on with practicing for your next interview in peace.”
Harry seized one of the POTTER REALLY STINKS badges off
the table and chucked it, as hard as he could, across the room. It hit
Ron on the forehead and bounced off.
“There you go,” Harry said. “Something for you to wear on

CHAPTER NINETEEN
Tuesday. You might even have a scar now, if you’re lucky. . . . That’s
what you want, isn’t it?”
He strode across the room toward the stairs; he half expected
Ron to stop him, he would even have liked Ron to throw a punch
at him, but Ron just stood there in his too-small pajamas, and
Harry, having stormed upstairs, lay awake in bed fuming for a long
time afterward and didn’t hear him come up to bed.

THE FIRST TASK

H

arry got up on Sunday morning and dressed so inattentively that it was a while before he realized he was trying
to pull his hat onto his foot instead of his sock. When he’d finally
got all his clothes on the right parts of his body, he hurried off to
find Hermione, locating her at the Gryffindor table in the Great
Hall, where she was eating breakfast with Ginny. Feeling too
queasy to eat, Harry waited until Hermione had swallowed her last
spoonful of porridge, then dragged her out onto the grounds.
There, he told her all about the dragons, and about everything
Sirius had said, while they took another long walk around the lake.
Alarmed as she was by Sirius’s warnings about Karkaroff,
Hermione still thought that the dragons were the more pressing
problem.
“Let’s just try and keep you alive until Tuesday evening,” she said
desperately, “and then we can worry about Karkaroff.”


337

CHAPTER TWENTY
They walked three times around the lake, trying all the way to
think of a simple spell that would subdue a dragon. Nothing whatsoever occurred to them, so they retired to the library instead.
Here, Harry pulled down every book he could find on dragons,
and both of them set to work searching through the large pile.
“ ‘Talon-clipping by charms . . . treating scale-rot . . .’ This is no
good, this is for nutters like Hagrid who want to keep them
healthy. . . .”
“ ‘Dragons are extremely difficult to slay, owing to the ancient magic
that imbues their thick hides, which none but the most powerful spells
can penetrate . . .’ But Sirius said a simple one would do it. . . .”
“Let’s try some simple spellbooks, then,” said Harry, throwing
aside Men Who Love Dragons Too Much.
He returned to the table with a pile of spellbooks, set them
down, and began to flick through each in turn, Hermione whispering nonstop at his elbow.
“Well, there are Switching Spells . . . but what’s the point of
Switching it? Unless you swapped its fangs for wine-gums or something that would make it less dangerous. . . . The trouble is, like
that book said, not much is going to get through a dragon’s
hide. . . . I’d say Transfigure it, but something that big, you really
haven’t got a hope, I doubt even Professor McGonagall . . . unless
you’re supposed to put the spell on yourself ? Maybe to give yourself
extra powers? But they’re not simple spells, I mean, we haven’t done
any of those in class, I only know about them because I’ve been doing O.W.L. practice papers. . . .”
“Hermione,” Harry said, through gritted teeth, “will you shut
up for a bit, please? I’m trying to concentrate.”
But all that happened, when Hermione fell silent, was that


338



THE FIRST TASK
Harry’s brain filled with a sort of blank buzzing, which didn’t seem
to allow room for concentration. He stared hopelessly down the index of Basic Hexes for the Busy and Vexed. Instant scalping . . . but
dragons had no hair . . . pepper breath . . . that would probably increase a dragon’s firepower . . . horn tongue . . . just what he
needed, to give it an extra weapon . . .
“Oh no, he’s back again, why can’t he read on his stupid ship?”
said Hermione irritably as Viktor Krum slouched in, cast a surly
look over at the pair of them, and settled himself in a distant corner with a pile of books. “Come on, Harry, we’ll go back to the
common room . . . his fan club’ll be here in a moment, twittering
away. . . .”
And sure enough, as they left the library, a gang of girls tiptoed
past them, one of them wearing a Bulgaria scarf tied around her
waist.
Harry barely slept that night. When he awoke on Monday morning, he seriously considered for the first time ever just running
away from Hogwarts. But as he looked around the Great Hall at
breakfast time, and thought about what leaving the castle would
mean, he knew he couldn’t do it. It was the only place he had ever
been happy . . . well, he supposed he must have been happy with
his parents too, but he couldn’t remember that.
Somehow, the knowledge that he would rather be here and facing a dragon than back on Privet Drive with Dudley was good to
know; it made him feel slightly calmer. He finished his bacon with
difficulty (his throat wasn’t working too well), and as he and
Hermione got up, he saw Cedric Diggory leaving the Hufflepuff
table.


339



CHAPTER TWENTY
Cedric still didn’t know about the dragons . . . the only champion who didn’t, if Harry was right in thinking that Maxime and
Karkaroff would have told Fleur and Krum. . . .
“Hermione, I’ll see you in the greenhouses,” Harry said, coming
to his decision as he watched Cedric leaving the Hall. “Go on, I’ll
catch you up.”
“Harry, you’ll be late, the bell’s about to ring —”
“I’ll catch you up, okay?”
By the time Harry reached the bottom of the marble staircase,
Cedric was at the top. He was with a load of sixth-year friends.
Harry didn’t want to talk to Cedric in front of them; they were
among those who had been quoting Rita Skeeter’s article at him
every time he went near them. He followed Cedric at a distance
and saw that he was heading toward the Charms corridor. This
gave Harry an idea. Pausing at a distance from them, he pulled out
his wand, and took careful aim.
“Diffindo!”
Cedric’s bag split. Parchment, quills, and books spilled out of it
onto the floor. Several bottles of ink smashed.
“Don’t bother,” said Cedric in an exasperated voice as his friends
bent down to help him. “Tell Flitwick I’m coming, go on. . . .”
This was exactly what Harry had been hoping for. He slipped his
wand back into his robes, waited until Cedric’s friends had disappeared into their classroom, and hurried up the corridor, which
was now empty of everyone but himself and Cedric.
“Hi,” said Cedric, picking up a copy of A Guide to Advanced
Transfiguration that was now splattered with ink. “My bag just
split . . . brand-new and all . . .”
“Cedric,” said Harry, “the first task is dragons.”


340



THE FIRST TASK
“What?” said Cedric, looking up.
“Dragons,” said Harry, speaking quickly, in case Professor Flitwick came out to see where Cedric had got to. “They’ve got four,
one for each of us, and we’ve got to get past them.”
Cedric stared at him. Harry saw some of the panic he’d been
feeling since Saturday night flickering in Cedric’s gray eyes.
“Are you sure?” Cedric said in a hushed voice.
“Dead sure,” said Harry. “I’ve seen them.”
“But how did you find out? We’re not supposed to know. . . .”
“Never mind,” said Harry quickly — he knew Hagrid would be
in trouble if he told the truth. “But I’m not the only one who knows.
Fleur and Krum will know by now — Maxime and Karkaroff both
saw the dragons too.”
Cedric straightened up, his arms full of inky quills, parchment,
and books, his ripped bag dangling off one shoulder. He stared at
Harry, and there was a puzzled, almost suspicious look in his eyes.
“Why are you telling me?” he asked.
Harry looked at him in disbelief. He was sure Cedric wouldn’t
have asked that if he had seen the dragons himself. Harry wouldn’t
have let his worst enemy face those monsters unprepared — well,
perhaps Malfoy or Snape . . .
“It’s just . . . fair, isn’t it?” he said to Cedric. “We all know
now . . . we’re on an even footing, aren’t we?”
Cedric was still looking at him in a slightly suspicious way when
Harry heard a familiar clunking noise behind him. He turned
around and saw Mad-Eye Moody emerging from a nearby classroom.
“Come with me, Potter,” he growled. “Diggory, off you go.”
Harry stared apprehensively at Moody. Had he overheard them?


341



CHAPTER TWENTY
“Er — Professor, I’m supposed to be in Herbology —”
“Never mind that, Potter. In my office, please. . . .”
Harry followed him, wondering what was going to happen to
him now. What if Moody wanted to know how he’d found out
about the dragons? Would Moody go to Dumbledore and tell on
Hagrid, or just turn Harry into a ferret? Well, it might be easier to
get past a dragon if he were a ferret, Harry thought dully, he’d be
smaller, much less easy to see from a height of fifty feet . . .
He followed Moody into his office. Moody closed the door behind them and turned to look at Harry, his magical eye fixed upon
him as well as the normal one.
“That was a very decent thing you just did, Potter,” Moody said
quietly.
Harry didn’t know what to say; this wasn’t the reaction he had
expected at all.
“Sit down,” said Moody, and Harry sat, looking around.
He had visited this office under two of its previous occupants. In
Professor Lockhart’s day, the walls had been plastered with beaming, winking pictures of Professor Lockhart himself. When Lupin
had lived here, you were more likely to come across a specimen of
some fascinating new Dark creature he had procured for them to
study in class. Now, however, the office was full of a number of exceptionally odd objects that Harry supposed Moody had used in
the days when he had been an Auror.
On his desk stood what looked like a large, cracked, glass spinning top; Harry recognized it at once as a Sneakoscope, because he
owned one himself, though it was much smaller than Moody’s. In
the corner on a small table stood an object that looked something
like an extra-squiggly, golden television aerial. It was humming


342

THE FIRST TASK
slightly. What appeared to be a mirror hung opposite Harry on the
wall, but it was not reflecting the room. Shadowy figures were moving around inside it, none of them clearly in focus.
“Like my Dark Detectors, do you?” said Moody, who was
watching Harry closely.
“What’s that?” Harry asked, pointing at the squiggly golden
aerial.
“Secrecy Sensor. Vibrates when it detects concealment and
lies . . . no use here, of course, too much interference — students
in every direction lying about why they haven’t done their homework. Been humming ever since I got here. I had to disable my
Sneakoscope because it wouldn’t stop whistling. It’s extra-sensitive,
picks up stuff about a mile around. Of course, it could be picking
up more than kid stuff,” he added in a growl.
“And what’s the mirror for?”
“Oh that’s my Foe-Glass. See them out there, skulking around?
I’m not really in trouble until I see the whites of their eyes. That’s
when I open my trunk.”
He let out a short, harsh laugh, and pointed to the large trunk
under the window. It had seven keyholes in a row. Harry wondered
what was in there, until Moody’s next question brought him
sharply back to earth.
“So . . . found out about the dragons, have you?”
Harry hesitated. He’d been afraid of this — but he hadn’t told
Cedric, and he certainly wasn’t going to tell Moody, that Hagrid
had broken the rules.
“It’s all right,” said Moody, sitting down and stretching out his
wooden leg with a groan. “Cheating’s a traditional part of the Triwizard Tournament and always has been.”


343



CHAPTER TWENTY
“I didn’t cheat,” said Harry sharply. “It was — a sort of accident
that I found out.”
Moody grinned. “I wasn’t accusing you, laddie. I’ve been telling
Dumbledore from the start, he can be as high-minded as he likes,
but you can bet old Karkaroff and Maxime won’t be. They’ll have
told their champions everything they can. They want to win. They
want to beat Dumbledore. They’d like to prove he’s only human.”
Moody gave another harsh laugh, and his magical eye swiveled
around so fast it made Harry feel queasy to watch it.
“So . . . got any ideas how you’re going to get past your dragon
yet?” said Moody.
“No,” said Harry.
“Well, I’m not going to tell you,” said Moody gruffly. “I don’t
show favoritism, me. I’m just going to give you some good, general
advice. And the first bit is — play to your strengths.”
“I haven’t got any,” said Harry, before he could stop himself.
“Excuse me,” growled Moody, “you’ve got strengths if I say
you’ve got them. Think now. What are you best at?”
Harry tried to concentrate. What was he best at? Well, that was
easy, really —
“Quidditch,” he said dully, “and a fat lot of help —”
“That’s right,” said Moody, staring at him very hard, his magical
eye barely moving at all. “You’re a damn good flier from what I’ve
heard.”
“Yeah, but . . .” Harry stared at him. “I’m not allowed a broom,
I’ve only got my wand —”
“My second piece of general advice,” said Moody loudly, interrupting him, “is to use a nice, simple spell that will enable you to
get what you need.”


344



THE FIRST TASK
Harry looked at him blankly. What did he need?
“Come on, boy . . .” whispered Moody. “Put them together . . .
it’s not that difficult. . . .”
And it clicked. He was best at flying. He needed to pass the
dragon in the air. For that, he needed his Firebolt. And for his Firebolt, he needed —
“Hermione,” Harry whispered, when he had sped into greenhouse
three minutes later, uttering a hurried apology to Professor Sprout
as he passed her. “Hermione — I need you to help me.”
“What d’you think I’ve been trying to do, Harry?” she whispered back, her eyes round with anxiety over the top of the quivering Flutterby Bush she was pruning.
“Hermione, I need to learn how to do a Summoning Charm
properly by tomorrow afternoon.”
And so they practiced. They didn’t have lunch, but headed for a
free classroom, where Harry tried with all his might to make various objects fly across the room toward him. He was still having
problems. The books and quills kept losing heart halfway across
the room and dropping like stones to the floor.
“Concentrate, Harry, concentrate. . . .”
“What d’you think I’m trying to do?” said Harry angrily. “A
great big dragon keeps popping up in my head for some reason. . . .
Okay, try again. . . .”
He wanted to skip Divination to keep practicing, but Hermione
refused point-blank to skive off Arithmancy, and there was no
point in staying without her. He therefore had to endure over an
hour of Professor Trelawney, who spent half the lesson telling


345



CHAPTER TWENTY
everyone that the position of Mars with relation to Saturn at that
moment meant that people born in July were in great danger of
sudden, violent deaths.
“Well, that’s good,” said Harry loudly, his temper getting the
better of him, “just as long as it’s not drawn-out. I don’t want to
suffer.”
Ron looked for a moment as though he was going to laugh; he
certainly caught Harry’s eye for the first time in days, but Harry
was still feeling too resentful toward Ron to care. He spent the rest
of the lesson trying to attract small objects toward him under the
table with his wand. He managed to make a fly zoom straight into
his hand, though he wasn’t entirely sure that was his prowess at
Summoning Charms — perhaps the fly was just stupid.
He forced down some dinner after Divination, then returned to
the empty classroom with Hermione, using the Invisibility Cloak
to avoid the teachers. They kept practicing until past midnight.
They would have stayed longer, but Peeves turned up and, pretending to think that Harry wanted things thrown at him, started
chucking chairs across the room. Harry and Hermione left in a
hurry before the noise attracted Filch, and went back to the
Gryffindor common room, which was now mercifully empty.
At two o’clock in the morning, Harry stood near the fireplace,
surrounded by heaps of objects: books, quills, several upturned
chairs, an old set of Gobstones, and Neville’s toad, Trevor. Only in
the last hour had Harry really got the hang of the Summoning
Charm.
“That’s better, Harry, that’s loads better,” Hermione said, looking exhausted but very pleased.
“Well, now we know what to do next time I can’t manage a


346



THE FIRST TASK
spell,” Harry said, throwing a rune dictionary back to Hermione,
so he could try again, “threaten me with a dragon. Right . . .” He
raised his wand once more. “Accio Dictionary!”
The heavy book soared out of Hermione’s hand, flew across the
room, and Harry caught it.
“Harry, I really think you’ve got it!” said Hermione delightedly.
“Just as long as it works tomorrow,” Harry said. “The Firebolt’s
going to be much farther away than the stuff in here, it’s going to
be in the castle, and I’m going to be out there on the grounds. . . .”
“That doesn’t matter,” said Hermione firmly “Just as long as
you’re concentrating really, really hard on it, it’ll come. Harry, we’d
better get some sleep . . . you’re going to need it.”
Harry had been focusing so hard on learning the Summoning
Charm that evening that some of his blind panic had left him. It returned in full measure, however, on the following morning. The atmosphere in the school was one of great tension and excitement.
Lessons were to stop at midday, giving all the students time to get
down to the dragons’ enclosure — though of course, they didn’t
yet know what they would find there.
Harry felt oddly separate from everyone around him, whether
they were wishing him good luck or hissing “We’ll have a box of tissues ready, Potter ” as he passed. It was a state of nervousness so advanced that he wondered whether he mightn’t just lose his head
when they tried to lead him out to his dragon, and start trying to
curse everyone in sight. Time was behaving in a more peculiar fashion than ever, rushing past in great dollops, so that one moment he
seemed to be sitting down in his first lesson, History of Magic, and
the next, walking into lunch . . . and then (where had the morning


347

CHAPTER TWENTY
gone? the last of the dragon-free hours?), Professor McGonagall
was hurrying over to him in the Great Hall. Lots of people were
watching.
“Potter, the champions have to come down onto the grounds
now. . . . You have to get ready for your first task.”
“Okay,” said Harry, standing up, his fork falling onto his plate
with a clatter.
“Good luck, Harry,” Hermione whispered. “You’ll be fine!”
“Yeah,” said Harry in a voice that was most unlike his own.
He left the Great Hall with Professor McGonagall. She didn’t
seem herself either; in fact, she looked nearly as anxious as Hermione. As she walked him down the stone steps and out into the
cold November afternoon, she put her hand on his shoulder.
“Now, don’t panic,” she said, “just keep a cool head. . . . We’ve
got wizards standing by to control the situation if it gets out of
hand. . . . The main thing is just to do your best, and nobody will
think any the worse of you. . . . Are you all right?”
“Yes,” Harry heard himself say. “Yes, I’m fine.”
She was leading him toward the place where the dragons were,
around the edge of the forest, but when they approached the clump
of trees behind which the enclosure would be clearly visible, Harry
saw that a tent had been erected, its entrance facing them, screening the dragons from view.
“You’re to go in here with the other champions,” said Professor
McGonagall, in a rather shaky sort of voice, “and wait for your
turn, Potter. Mr. Bagman is in there . . . he’ll be telling you the —
the procedure. . . . Good luck.”
“Thanks,” said Harry, in a flat, distant voice. She left him at the
entrance of the tent. Harry went inside.


348



THE FIRST TASK
Fleur Delacour was sitting in a corner on a low wooden stool.
She didn’t look nearly as composed as usual, but rather pale and
clammy. Viktor Krum looked even surlier than usual, which Harry
supposed was his way of showing nerves. Cedric was pacing up and
down. When Harry entered, Cedric gave him a small smile, which
Harry returned, feeling the muscles in his face working rather hard,
as though they had forgotten how to do it.
“Harry! Good-o!” said Bagman happily, looking around at him.
“Come in, come in, make yourself at home!”
Bagman looked somehow like a slightly overblown cartoon figure, standing amid all the pale-faced champions. He was wearing
his old Wasp robes again.
“Well, now we’re all here — time to fill you in!” said Bagman
brightly. “When the audience has assembled, I’m going to be offering
each of you this bag” — he held up a small sack of purple silk and
shook it at them — “from which you will each select a small model of
the thing you are about to face! There are different — er — varieties,
you see. And I have to tell you something else too . . . ah, yes . . .
your task is to collect the golden egg!”
Harry glanced around. Cedric had nodded once, to show that he
understood Bagman’s words, and then started pacing around the
tent again; he looked slightly green. Fleur Delacour and Krum
hadn’t reacted at all. Perhaps they thought they might be sick if
they opened their mouths; that was certainly how Harry felt. But
they, at least, had volunteered for this. . . .
And in no time at all, hundreds upon hundreds of pairs of feet
could be heard passing the tent, their owners talking excitedly,
laughing, joking. . . . Harry felt as separate from the crowd as
though they were a different species. And then — it seemed like


CHAPTER TWENTY
about a second later to Harry — Bagman was opening the neck of
the purple silk sack.
“Ladies first,” he said, offering it to Fleur Delacour.
She put a shaking hand inside the bag and drew out a tiny, perfect model of a dragon — a Welsh Green. It had the number two
around its neck. And Harry knew, by the fact that Fleur showed no
sign of surprise, but rather a determined resignation, that he had
been right: Madame Maxime had told her what was coming.
The same held true for Krum. He pulled out the scarlet Chinese
Fireball. It had a number three around its neck. He didn’t even
blink, just sat back down and stared at the ground.
Cedric put his hand into the bag, and out came the blueish-gray
Swedish Short-Snout, the number one tied around its neck. Knowing what was left, Harry put his hand into the silk bag and pulled
out the Hungarian Horntail, and the number four. It stretched its
wings as he looked down at it, and bared its minuscule fangs.
“Well, there you are!” said Bagman. “You have each pulled out the
dragon you will face, and the numbers refer to the order in which
you are to take on the dragons, do you see? Now, I’m going to have
to leave you in a moment, because I’m commentating. Mr. Diggory,
you’re first, just go out into the enclosure when you hear a whistle,
all right? Now . . . Harry . . . could I have a quick word? Outside?”
“Er . . . yes,” said Harry blankly, and he got up and went out of
the tent with Bagman, who walked him a short distance away, into
the trees, and then turned to him with a fatherly expression on his
face.
“Feeling all right, Harry? Anything I can get you?”
“What?” said Harry. “I — no, nothing.”


350



THE FIRST TASK
“Got a plan?” said Bagman, lowering his voice conspiratorially.
“Because I don’t mind sharing a few pointers, if you’d like them,
you know. I mean,” Bagman continued, lowering his voice still further, “you’re the underdog here, Harry. . . . Anything I can do to
help . . .”
“No,” said Harry so quickly he knew he had sounded rude,
“no — I — I know what I’m going to do, thanks.”
“Nobody would know, Harry,” said Bagman, winking at him.
“No, I’m fine,” said Harry, wondering why he kept telling people this, and wondering whether he had ever been less fine. “I’ve
got a plan worked out, I —”
A whistle had blown somewhere.
“Good lord, I’ve got to run!” said Bagman in alarm, and he hurried off.
Harry walked back to the tent and saw Cedric emerging from it,
greener than ever. Harry tried to wish him luck as he walked past,
but all that came out of his mouth was a sort of hoarse grunt.
Harry went back inside to Fleur and Krum. Seconds later, they
heard the roar of the crowd, which meant Cedric had entered the
enclosure and was now face-to-face with the living counterpart of
his model. . . .
It was worse than Harry could ever have imagined, sitting there
and listening. The crowd screamed . . . yelled . . . gasped like a single many-headed entity, as Cedric did whatever he was doing to get
past the Swedish Short-Snout. Krum was still staring at the
ground. Fleur had now taken to retracing Cedric’s steps, around
and around the tent. And Bagman’s commentary made everything
much, much worse. . . . Horrible pictures formed in Harry’s mind


351



CHAPTER TWENTY
as he heard: “Oooh, narrow miss there, very narrow” . . . “He’s taking risks, this one!” . . . “Clever move — pity it didn’t work!”
And then, after about fifteen minutes, Harry heard the deafening roar that could mean only one thing: Cedric had gotten past
his dragon and captured the golden egg.
“Very good indeed!” Bagman was shouting. “And now the marks
from the judges!”
But he didn’t shout out the marks; Harry supposed the judges
were holding them up and showing them to the crowd.
“One down, three to go!” Bagman yelled as the whistle blew
again. “Miss Delacour, if you please!”
Fleur was trembling from head to foot; Harry felt more warmly
toward her than he had done so far as she left the tent with her head
held high and her hand clutching her wand. He and Krum were
left alone, at opposite sides of the tent, avoiding each other’s gaze.
The same process started again. . . . “Oh I’m not sure that was
wise!” they could hear Bagman shouting gleefully. “Oh . . . nearly!
Careful now . . . good lord, I thought she’d had it then!”
Ten minutes later, Harry heard the crowd erupt into applause
once more. . . . Fleur must have been successful too. A pause, while
Fleur’s marks were being shown . . . more clapping . . . then, for
the third time, the whistle.
“And here comes Mr. Krum!” cried Bagman, and Krum
slouched out, leaving Harry quite alone.
He felt much more aware of his body than usual; very aware of
the way his heart was pumping fast, and his fingers tingling with
fear . . . yet at the same time, he seemed to be outside himself, seeing the walls of the tent, and hearing the crowd, as though from far
away. . . .


352



THE FIRST TASK
“Very daring!” Bagman was yelling, and Harry heard the Chinese Fireball emit a horrible, roaring shriek, while the crowd drew
its collective breath. “That’s some nerve he’s showing — and —
yes, he’s got the egg!”
Applause shattered the wintery air like breaking glass; Krum had
finished — it would be Harry’s turn any moment.
He stood up, noticing dimly that his legs seemed to be made of
marshmallow. He waited. And then he heard the whistle blow. He
walked out through the entrance of the tent, the panic rising into a
crescendo inside him. And now he was walking past the trees,
through a gap in the enclosure fence.
He saw everything in front of him as though it was a very highly
colored dream. There were hundreds and hundreds of faces staring
down at him from stands that had been magicked there since he’d
last stood on this spot. And there was the Horntail, at the other end
of the enclosure, crouched low over her clutch of eggs, her wings
half-furled, her evil, yellow eyes upon him, a monstrous, scaly,
black lizard, thrashing her spiked tail, leaving yard-long gouge
marks in the hard ground. The crowd was making a great deal of
noise, but whether friendly or not, Harry didn’t know or care. It
was time to do what he had to do . . . to focus his mind, entirely
and absolutely, upon the thing that was his only chance. . . .
He raised his wand.
“Accio Firebolt!” he shouted.
Harry waited, every fiber of him hoping, praying. . . . If it hadn’t
worked . . . if it wasn’t coming . . . He seemed to be looking at
everything around him through some sort of shimmering, transparent barrier, like a heat haze, which made the enclosure and the
hundreds of faces around him swim strangely. . . .

CHAPTER TWENTY
And then he heard it, speeding through the air behind him; he
turned and saw his Firebolt hurtling toward him around the edge
of the woods, soaring into the enclosure, and stopping dead in
midair beside him, waiting for him to mount. The crowd was making even more noise. . . . Bagman was shouting something . . . but
Harry’s ears were not working properly anymore . . . listening
wasn’t important. . . .
He swung his leg over the broom and kicked off from the
ground. And a second later, something miraculous happened. . . .
As he soared upward, as the wind rushed through his hair, as the
crowd’s faces became mere flesh-colored pinpricks below, and the
Horntail shrank to the size of a dog, he realized that he had left not
only the ground behind, but also his fear. . . . He was back where
he belonged. . . .
This was just another Quidditch match, that was all . . . just another Quidditch match, and that Horntail was just another ugly
opposing team. . . .
He looked down at the clutch of eggs and spotted the gold one,
gleaming against its cement-colored fellows, residing safely between the dragon’s front legs. “Okay,” Harry told himself, “diversionary tactics . . . let’s go. . . .”
He dived. The Horntail’s head followed him; he knew what it
was going to do and pulled out of the dive just in time; a jet of fire
had been released exactly where he would have been had he not
swerved away . . . but Harry didn’t care . . . that was no more than
dodging a Bludger. . . .
“Great Scott, he can fly!” yelled Bagman as the crowd shrieked
and gasped. “Are you watching this, Mr. Krum?”
Harry soared higher in a circle; the Horntail was still following




THE FIRST TASK
his progress; its head revolving on its long neck — if he kept this
up, it would be nicely dizzy — but better not push it too long, or
it would be breathing fire again —
Harry plummeted just as the Horntail opened its mouth, but
this time he was less lucky — he missed the flames, but the tail
came whipping up to meet him instead, and as he swerved to the
left, one of the long spikes grazed his shoulder, ripping his robes —
He could feel it stinging, he could hear screaming and groans
from the crowd, but the cut didn’t seem to be deep. . . . Now he
zoomed around the back of the Horntail, and a possibility occurred
to him. . . .
The Horntail didn’t seem to want to take off, she was too protective of her eggs. Though she writhed and twisted, furling and
unfurling her wings and keeping those fearsome yellow eyes on
Harry, she was afraid to move too far from them . . . but he had to
persuade her to do it, or he’d never get near them. . . . The trick
was to do it carefully, gradually. . . .
He began to fly, first this way, then the other, not near enough to
make her breathe fire to stave him off, but still posing a sufficient
threat to ensure she kept her eyes on him. Her head swayed this
way and that, watching him out of those vertical pupils, her fangs
bared. . . .
He flew higher. The Horntail’s head rose with him, her neck
now stretched to its fullest extent, still swaying, like a snake before
its charmer. . . .
Harry rose a few more feet, and she let out a roar of exasperation. He was like a fly to her, a fly she was longing to swat; her tail
thrashed again, but he was too high to reach now. . . . She shot fire
into the air, which he dodged. . . . Her jaws opened wide. . . .


355

CHAPTER TWENTY
“Come on,” Harry hissed, swerving tantalizingly above her,
“come on, come and get me . . . up you get now . . .”
And then she reared, spreading her great, black, leathery wings
at last, as wide as those of a small airplane — and Harry dived.
Before the dragon knew what he had done, or where he had disappeared to, he was speeding toward the ground as fast as he could
go, toward the eggs now unprotected by her clawed front legs —
he had taken his hands off his Firebolt — he had seized the golden
egg —
And with a huge spurt of speed, he was off, he was soaring out
over the stands, the heavy egg safely under his uninjured arm, and
it was as though somebody had just turned the volume back up —
for the first time, he became properly aware of the noise of the
crowd, which was screaming and applauding as loudly as the Irish
supporters at the World Cup —
“Look at that!” Bagman was yelling. “Will you look at that! Our
youngest champion is quickest to get his egg! Well, this is going to
shorten the odds on Mr. Potter!”
Harry saw the dragon keepers rushing forward to subdue the
Horntail, and, over at the entrance to the enclosure, Professor
McGonagall, Professor Moody, and Hagrid hurrying to meet him,
all of them waving him toward them, their smiles evident even
from this distance. He flew back over the stands, the noise of the
crowd pounding his eardrums, and came in smoothly to land, his
heart lighter than it had been in weeks. . . . He had got through the
first task, he had survived. . . .
“That was excellent, Potter!” cried Professor McGonagall as he
got off the Firebolt — which from her was extravagant praise. He
noticed that her hand shook as she pointed at his shoulder. “You’ll

THE FIRST TASK
need to see Madam Pomfrey before the judges give out your
score. . . . Over there, she’s had to mop up Diggory already. . . .”
“Yeh did it, Harry!” said Hagrid hoarsely. “Yeh did it! An’ agains’
the Horntail an’ all, an’ yeh know Charlie said that was the
wors’ —”
“Thanks, Hagrid,” said Harry loudly, so that Hagrid wouldn’t
blunder on and reveal that he had shown Harry the dragons
beforehand.
Professor Moody looked very pleased too; his magical eye was
dancing in its socket.
“Nice and easy does the trick, Potter,” he growled.
“Right then, Potter, the first aid tent, please . . .” said Professor
McGonagall.
Harry walked out of the enclosure, still panting, and saw
Madam Pomfrey standing at the mouth of a second tent, looking
worried.
“Dragons!” she said, in a disgusted tone, pulling Harry inside.
The tent was divided into cubicles; he could make out Cedric’s
shadow through the canvas, but Cedric didn’t seem to be badly injured; he was sitting up, at least. Madam Pomfrey examined
Harry’s shoulder, talking furiously all the while. “Last year dementors, this year dragons, what are they going to bring into this school
next? You’re very lucky . . . this is quite shallow . . . it’ll need cleaning before I heal it up, though. . . .”
She cleaned the cut with a dab of some purple liquid that
smoked and stung, but then poked his shoulder with her wand,
and he felt it heal instantly.
“Now, just sit quietly for a minute — sit! And then you can go
and get your score.”


357



CHAPTER TWENTY
She bustled out of the tent and he heard her go next door and
say, “How does it feel now, Diggory?”
Harry didn’t want to sit still: He was too full of adrenaline. He
got to his feet, wanting to see what was going on outside, but before he’d reached the mouth of the tent, two people had come darting inside — Hermione, followed closely by Ron.
“Harry, you were brilliant!” Hermione said squeakily. There
were fingernail marks on her face where she had been clutching it
in fear. “You were amazing! You really were!”
But Harry was looking at Ron, who was very white and staring
at Harry as though he were a ghost.
“Harry,” he said, very seriously, “whoever put your name in that
goblet — I — I reckon they’re trying to do you in!”
It was as though the last few weeks had never happened — as
though Harry were meeting Ron for the first time, right after he’d
been made champion.
“Caught on, have you?” said Harry coldly. “Took you long
enough.”
Hermione stood nervously between them, looking from one to
the other. Ron opened his mouth uncertainly. Harry knew Ron
was about to apologize and suddenly he found he didn’t need to
hear it.
“It’s okay,” he said, before Ron could get the words out. “Forget it.”
“No,” said Ron, “I shouldn’t’ve —”
“Forget it,” Harry said.
Ron grinned nervously at him, and Harry grinned back.
Hermione burst into tears.
“There’s nothing to cry about!” Harry told her, bewildered.
“You two are so stupid !” she shouted, stamping her foot on the

THE FIRST TASK
ground, tears splashing down her front. Then, before either of
them could stop her, she had given both of them a hug and dashed
away, now positively howling.
“Barking mad,” said Ron, shaking his head. “Harry, c’mon,
they’ll be putting up your scores. . . .”
Picking up the golden egg and his Firebolt, feeling more elated
than he would have believed possible an hour ago, Harry ducked
out of the tent, Ron by his side, talking fast.
“You were the best, you know, no competition. Cedric did this
weird thing where he Transfigured a rock on the ground . . . turned
it into a dog . . . he was trying to make the dragon go for the dog
instead of him. Well, it was a pretty cool bit of Transfiguration, and
it sort of worked, because he did get the egg, but he got burned as
well — the dragon changed its mind halfway through and decided
it would rather have him than the Labrador; he only just got away.
And that Fleur girl tried this sort of charm, I think she was trying
to put it into a trance — well, that kind of worked too, it went all
sleepy, but then it snored, and this great jet of flame shot out, and
her skirt caught fire — she put it out with a bit of water out of her
wand. And Krum — you won’t believe this, but he didn’t even
think of flying! He was probably the best after you, though. Hit it
with some sort of spell right in the eye. Only thing is, it went trampling around in agony and squashed half the real eggs — they took
marks off for that, he wasn’t supposed to do any damage to them.”
Ron drew breath as he and Harry reached the edge of the enclosure. Now that the Horntail had been taken away, Harry could see
where the five judges were sitting — right at the other end, in
raised seats draped in gold.
“It’s marks out of ten from each one,” Ron said, and Harry,


359



CHAPTER TWENTY
squinting up the field, saw the first judge — Madame Maxime —
raise her wand in the air. What looked like a long silver ribbon shot
out of it, which twisted itself into a large figure eight.
“Not bad!” said Ron as the crowd applauded. “I suppose she
took marks off for your shoulder. . . .”
Mr. Crouch came next. He shot a number nine into the air.
“Looking good!” Ron yelled, thumping Harry on the back.
Next, Dumbledore. He too put up a nine. The crowd was cheering harder than ever.
Ludo Bagman — ten.
“Ten?” said Harry in disbelief. “But . . . I got hurt. . . . What’s
he playing at?”
“Harry, don’t complain!” Ron yelled excitedly.
And now Karkaroff raised his wand. He paused for a moment,
and then a number shot out of his wand too — four.
“What?” Ron bellowed furiously. “Four? You lousy, biased scumbag, you gave Krum ten!”
But Harry didn’t care, he wouldn’t have cared if Karkaroff had
given him zero; Ron’s indignation on his behalf was worth about a
hundred points to him. He didn’t tell Ron this, of course, but his
heart felt lighter than air as he turned to leave the enclosure. And it
wasn’t just Ron . . . those weren’t only Gryffindors cheering in the
crowd. When it had come to it, when they had seen what he was
facing, most of the school had been on his side as well as
Cedric’s. . . . He didn’t care about the Slytherins, he could stand
whatever they threw at him now.
“You’re tied in first place, Harry! You and Krum!” said Charlie
Weasley, hurrying to meet them as they set off back toward the
school. “Listen, I’ve got to run, I’ve got to go and send Mum an

owl, I swore I’d tell her what happened — but that was unbelievable! Oh yeah — and they told me to tell you you’ve got to hang
around for a few more minutes. . . . Bagman wants a word, back in
the champions’ tent.”
Ron said he would wait, so Harry reentered the tent, which
somehow looked quite different now: friendly and welcoming. He
thought back to how he’d felt while dodging the Horntail, and
compared it to the long wait before he’d walked out to face it. . . .
There was no comparison; the wait had been immeasurably worse.
Fleur, Cedric, and Krum all came in together. One side of
Cedric’s face was covered in a thick orange paste, which was presumably mending his burn. He grinned at Harry when he saw him.
“Good one, Harry.”
“And you,” said Harry, grinning back.
“Well done, all of you!” said Ludo Bagman, bouncing into the
tent and looking as pleased as though he personally had just got
past a dragon. “Now, just a quick few words. You’ve got a nice long
break before the second task, which will take place at half past nine
on the morning of February the twenty-fourth — but we’re giving
you something to think about in the meantime! If you look down
at those golden eggs you’re all holding, you will see that they
open . . . see the hinges there? You need to solve the clue inside the
egg — because it will tell you what the second task is, and enable
you to prepare for it! All clear? Sure? Well, off you go, then!”
Harry left the tent, rejoined Ron, and they started to walk back
around the edge of the forest, talking hard; Harry wanted to hear
what the other champions had done in more detail. Then, as they
rounded the clump of trees behind which Harry had first heard the
dragons roar, a witch leapt out from behind them.

It was Rita Skeeter. She was wearing acid-green robes today; the
Quick-Quotes Quill in her hand blended perfectly against them.
“Congratulations, Harry!” she said, beaming at him. “I wonder
if you could give me a quick word? How you felt facing that
dragon? How you feel now, about the fairness of the scoring?”
“Yeah, you can have a word,” said Harry savagely. “Good-bye.”
And he set off back to the castle with Ron.

H

arry, Ron, and Hermione went up to the Owlery that
evening to find Pigwidgeon, so that Harry could send
Sirius a letter telling him that he had managed to get past his
dragon unscathed. On the way, Harry filled Ron in on everything
Sirius had told him about Karkaroff. Though shocked at first to
hear that Karkaroff had been a Death Eater, by the time they entered the Owlery Ron was saying that they ought to have suspected
it all along.
“Fits, doesn’t it?” he said. “Remember what Malfoy said on the
train, about his dad being friends with Karkaroff? Now we know
where they knew each other. They were probably running around
in masks together at the World Cup. . . . I’ll tell you one thing,
though, Harry, if it was Karkaroff who put your name in the goblet, he’s going to be feeling really stupid now, isn’t he? Didn’t work,
did it? You only got a scratch! Come here — I’ll do it —”
Pigwidgeon was so overexcited at the idea of a delivery he was


363



CHAPTER TWENTY-ONE
flying around and around Harry’s head, hooting incessantly. Ron
snatched Pigwidgeon out of the air and held him still while Harry
attached the letter to his leg.
“There’s no way any of the other tasks are going to be that dangerous, how could they be?” Ron went on as he carried Pigwidgeon
to the window. “You know what? I reckon you could win this tournament, Harry, I’m serious.”
Harry knew that Ron was only saying this to make up for his behavior of the last few weeks, but he appreciated it all the same.
Hermione, however, leaned against the Owlery wall, folded her
arms, and frowned at Ron.
“Harry’s got a long way to go before he finishes this tournament,” she said seriously. “If that was the first task, I hate to think
what’s coming next.”
“Right little ray of sunshine, aren’t you?” said Ron. “You and
Professor Trelawney should get together sometime.”
He threw Pigwidgeon out of the window. Pigwidgeon plummeted twelve feet before managing to pull himself back up again;
the letter attached to his leg was much longer and heavier than
usual — Harry hadn’t been able to resist giving Sirius a blow-byblow account of exactly how he had swerved, circled, and dodged
the Horntail. They watched Pigwidgeon disappear into the darkness, and then Ron said, “Well, we’d better get downstairs for your
surprise party, Harry — Fred and George should have nicked
enough food from the kitchens by now.”
Sure enough, when they entered the Gryffindor common room
it exploded with cheers and yells again. There were mountains
of cakes and flagons of pumpkin juice and butterbeer on every

surface; Lee Jordan had let off some Filibuster’s Fireworks, so that
the air was thick with stars and sparks; and Dean Thomas, who was
very good at drawing, had put up some impressive new banners,
most of which depicted Harry zooming around the Horntail’s head
on his Firebolt, though a couple showed Cedric with his head on
fire.
Harry helped himself to food; he had almost forgotten what it
was like to feel properly hungry, and sat down with Ron and
Hermione. He couldn’t believe how happy he felt; he had Ron back
on his side, he’d gotten through the first task, and he wouldn’t have
to face the second one for three months.
“Blimey, this is heavy,” said Lee Jordan, picking up the golden
egg, which Harry had left on a table, and weighing it in his hands.
“Open it, Harry, go on! Let’s just see what’s inside it!”
“He’s supposed to work out the clue on his own,” Hermione said
swiftly. “It’s in the tournament rules. . . .”
“I was supposed to work out how to get past the dragon on my
own too,” Harry muttered, so only Hermione could hear him, and
she grinned rather guiltily.
“Yeah, go on, Harry, open it!” several people echoed.
Lee passed Harry the egg, and Harry dug his fingernails into the
groove that ran all the way around it and prised it open.
It was hollow and completely empty — but the moment Harry
opened it, the most horrible noise, a loud and screechy wailing,
filled the room. The nearest thing to it Harry had ever heard was
the ghost orchestra at Nearly Headless Nick’s deathday party, who
had all been playing the musical saw.
“Shut it!” Fred bellowed, his hands over his ears.


365



CHAPTER TWENTY-ONE
“What was that?” said Seamus Finnigan, staring at the egg as
Harry slammed it shut again. “Sounded like a banshee. . . . Maybe
you’ve got to get past one of those next, Harry!”
“It was someone being tortured!” said Neville, who had gone
very white and spilled sausage rolls all over the floor. “You’re going
to have to fight the Cruciatus Curse!”
“Don’t be a prat, Neville, that’s illegal,” said George. “They
wouldn’t use the Cruciatus Curse on the champions. I thought it
sounded a bit like Percy singing . . . maybe you’ve got to attack him
while he’s in the shower, Harry.”
“Want a jam tart, Hermione?” said Fred.
Hermione looked doubtfully at the plate he was offering her.
Fred grinned.
“It’s all right,” he said. “I haven’t done anything to them. It’s the
custard creams you’ve got to watch —”
Neville, who had just bitten into a custard cream, choked and
spat it out. Fred laughed.
“Just my little joke, Neville. . . .”
Hermione took a jam tart. Then she said, “Did you get all this
from the kitchens, Fred?”
“Yep,” said Fred, grinning at her. He put on a high-pitched
squeak and imitated a house-elf. “ ‘Anything we can get you, sir,
anything at all!’ They’re dead helpful . . . get me a roast ox if I said
I was peckish.”
“How do you get in there?” Hermione said in an innocently
casual sort of voice.
“Easy,” said Fred, “concealed door behind a painting of a bowl
of fruit. Just tickle the pear, and it giggles and —” He stopped and
looked suspiciously at her. “Why?”


366

THE HOUSE-ELF
LIBERATION FRONT
“Nothing,” said Hermione quickly.
“Going to try and lead the house-elves out on strike now, are
you?” said George. “Going to give up all the leaflet stuff and try
and stir them up into rebellion?”
Several people chortled. Hermione didn’t answer.
“Don’t you go upsetting them and telling them they’ve got to
take clothes and salaries!” said Fred warningly “You’ll put them off
their cooking!”
Just then, Neville caused a slight diversion by turning into a
large canary.
“Oh — sorry, Neville!” Fred shouted over all the laughter. “I forgot — it was the custard creams we hexed —”
Within a minute, however, Neville had molted, and once his
feathers had fallen off, he reappeared looking entirely normal. He
even joined in laughing.
“Canary Creams!” Fred shouted to the excitable crowd. “George
and I invented them — seven Sickles each, a bargain!”
It was nearly one in the morning when Harry finally went up to
the dormitory with Ron, Neville, Seamus, and Dean. Before he
pulled the curtains of his four-poster shut, Harry set his tiny model
of the Hungarian Horntail on the table next to his bed, where it
yawned, curled up, and closed its eyes. Really, Harry thought, as he
pulled the hangings on his four-poster closed, Hagrid had a
point . . . they were all right, really, dragons. . . .
The start of December brought wind and sleet to Hogwarts. Drafty
though the castle always was in winter, Harry was glad of its fires
and thick walls every time he passed the Durmstrang ship on the
lake, which was pitching in the high winds, its black sails billowing


CHAPTER TWENTY-ONE
against the dark skies. He thought the Beauxbatons caravan was
likely to be pretty chilly too. Hagrid, he noticed, was keeping
Madame Maxime’s horses well provided with their preferred drink
of single-malt whiskey; the fumes wafting from the trough in the
corner of their paddock was enough to make the entire Care of
Magical Creatures class light-headed. This was unhelpful, as they
were still tending the horrible skrewts and needed their wits about
them.
“I’m not sure whether they hibernate or not,” Hagrid told the
shivering class in the windy pumpkin patch next lesson. “Thought
we’d jus’ try an’ see if they fancied a kip . . . we’ll jus’ settle ’em
down in these boxes. . . .”
There were now only ten skrewts left; apparently their desire to
kill one another had not been exercised out of them. Each of them
was now approaching six feet in length. Their thick gray armor;
their powerful, scuttling legs; their fire-blasting ends; their stings
and their suckers, combined to make the skrewts the most repulsive things Harry had ever seen. The class looked dispiritedly at the
enormous boxes Hagrid had brought out, all lined with pillows
and fluffy blankets.
“We’ll jus’ lead ’em in here,” Hagrid said, “an’ put the lids on,
and we’ll see what happens.”
But the skrewts, it transpired, did not hibernate, and did not appreciate being forced into pillow-lined boxes and nailed in. Hagrid
was soon yelling, “Don’ panic, now, don’ panic!” while the skrewts
rampaged around the pumpkin patch, now strewn with the smoldering wreckage of the boxes. Most of the class — Malfoy, Crabbe,
and Goyle in the lead — had fled into Hagrid’s cabin through the


THE HOUSE-ELF
LIBERATION FRONT
back door and barricaded themselves in; Harry, Ron, and Hermione, however, were among those who remained outside trying to
help Hagrid. Together they managed to restrain and tie up nine of
the skrewts, though at the cost of numerous burns and cuts; finally,
only one skrewt was left.
“Don’ frighten him, now!” Hagrid shouted as Ron and Harry
used their wands to shoot jets of fiery sparks at the skrewt, which
was advancing menacingly on them, its sting arched, quivering,
over its back. “Jus’ try an’ slip the rope ’round his sting, so he won’
hurt any o’ the others!”
“Yeah, we wouldn’t want that!” Ron shouted angrily as he and
Harry backed into the wall of Hagrid’s cabin, still holding the
skrewt off with their sparks.
“Well, well, well . . . this does look like fun.”
Rita Skeeter was leaning on Hagrid’s garden fence, looking in at
the mayhem. She was wearing a thick magenta cloak with a furry
purple collar today, and her crocodile-skin handbag was over her
arm.
Hagrid launched himself forward on top of the skrewt that was
cornering Harry and Ron and flattened it; a blast of fire shot out of
its end, withering the pumpkin plants nearby.
“Who’re you?” Hagrid asked Rita Skeeter as he slipped a loop of
rope around the skrewt’s sting and tightened it.
“Rita Skeeter, Daily Prophet reporter,” Rita replied, beaming at
him. Her gold teeth glinted.
“Thought Dumbledore said you weren’ allowed inside the
school anymore,” said Hagrid, frowning slightly as he got off the
slightly squashed skrewt and started tugging it over to its fellows.


369

CHAPTER TWENTY-ONE
Rita acted as though she hadn’t heard what Hagrid had said.
“What are these fascinating creatures called?” she asked, beaming still more widely.
“Blast-Ended Skrewts,” grunted Hagrid.
“Really?” said Rita, apparently full of lively interest. “I’ve never
heard of them before . . . where do they come from?”
Harry noticed a dull red flush rising up out of Hagrid’s wild
black beard, and his heart sank. Where had Hagrid got the skrewts
from? Hermione, who seemed to be thinking along these lines, said
quickly, “They’re very interesting, aren’t they? Aren’t they, Harry?”
“What? Oh yeah . . . ouch . . . interesting,” said Harry as she
stepped on his foot.
“Ah, you’re here, Harry!” said Rita Skeeter as she looked around.
“So you like Care of Magical Creatures, do you? One of your favorite lessons?”
“Yes,” said Harry stoutly. Hagrid beamed at him.
“Lovely,” said Rita. “Really lovely. Been teaching long?” she
added to Hagrid.
Harry noticed her eyes travel over Dean (who had a nasty cut
across one cheek), Lavender (whose robes were badly singed), Seamus (who was nursing several burnt fingers), and then to the cabin
windows, where most of the class stood, their noses pressed against
the glass waiting to see if the coast was clear.
“This is o’ny me second year,” said Hagrid.
“Lovely. . . I don’t suppose you’d like to give an interview,
would you? Share some of your experience of magical creatures?
The Prophet does a zoological column every Wednesday, as I’m sure
you know. We could feature these — er — Bang-Ended Scoots.”


THE HOUSE-ELF
LIBERATION FRONT
“Blast-Ended Skrewts,” Hagrid said eagerly. “Er — yeah, why
not?”
Harry had a very bad feeling about this, but there was no way of
communicating it to Hagrid without Rita Skeeter seeing, so he had
to stand and watch in silence as Hagrid and Rita Skeeter made
arrangements to meet in the Three Broomsticks for a good long interview later that week. Then the bell rang up at the castle, signaling the end of the lesson.
“Well, good-bye, Harry!” Rita Skeeter called merrily to him as
he set off with Ron and Hermione. “Until Friday night, then,
Hagrid!”
“She’ll twist everything he says,” Harry said under his breath.
“Just as long as he didn’t import those skrewts illegally or anything,” said Hermione desperately. They looked at one another —
it was exactly the sort of thing Hagrid might do.
“Hagrid’s been in loads of trouble before, and Dumbledore’s
never sacked him,” said Ron consolingly. “Worst that can happen
is Hagrid’ll have to get rid of the skrewts. Sorry . . . did I say worst?
I meant best.”
Harry and Hermione laughed, and, feeling slightly more cheerful, went off to lunch.
Harry thoroughly enjoyed double Divination that afternoon;
they were still doing star charts and predictions, but now that he and
Ron were friends once more, the whole thing seemed very funny
again. Professor Trelawney, who had been so pleased with the pair of
them when they had been predicting their own horrific deaths,
quickly became irritated as they sniggered through her explanation
of the various ways in which Pluto could disrupt everyday life.

“I would think,” she said, in a mystical whisper that did not conceal her obvious annoyance, “that some of us” — she stared very
meaningfully at Harry — “might be a little less frivolous had they
seen what I have seen during my crystal gazing last night. As I sat
here, absorbed in my needlework, the urge to consult the orb overpowered me. I arose, I settled myself before it, and I gazed into its
crystalline depths . . . and what do you think I saw gazing back at
me?”
“An ugly old bat in outsize specs?” Ron muttered under his
breath.
Harry fought hard to keep his face straight.
“Death, my dears.”
Parvati and Lavender both put their hands over their mouths,
looking horrified.
“Yes,” said Professor Trelawney, nodding impressively, “it comes,
ever closer, it circles overhead like a vulture, ever lower . . . ever
lower over the castle. . . .”
She stared pointedly at Harry, who yawned very widely and
obviously.
“It’d be a bit more impressive if she hadn’t done it about eighty
times before,” Harry said as they finally regained the fresh air of the
staircase beneath Professor Trelawney’s room. “But if I’d dropped
dead every time she’s told me I’m going to, I’d be a medical
miracle.”
“You’d be a sort of extra-concentrated ghost,” said Ron,
chortling, as they passed the Bloody Baron going in the opposite
direction, his wide eyes staring sinisterly. “At least we didn’t get
homework. I hope Hermione got loads off Professor Vector, I love
not working when she is. . . .”

But Hermione wasn’t at dinner, nor was she in the library when
they went to look for her afterward. The only person in there was
Viktor Krum. Ron hovered behind the bookshelves for a while,
watching Krum, debating in whispers with Harry whether he
should ask for an autograph — but then Ron realized that six or
seven girls were lurking in the next row of books, debating exactly
the same thing, and he lost his enthusiasm for the idea.
“Wonder where she’s got to?” Ron said as he and Harry went
back to Gryffindor Tower.
“Dunno . . . balderdash.”
But the Fat Lady had barely begun to swing forward when the
sound of racing feet behind them announced Hermione’s arrival.
“Harry!” she panted, skidding to a halt beside him (the Fat Lady
stared down at her, eyebrows raised). “Harry, you’ve got to come —
you’ve got to come, the most amazing thing’s happened —
please —”
She seized Harry’s arm and started to try to drag him back along
the corridor.
“What’s the matter?” Harry said.
“I’ll show you when we get there — oh come on, quick —”
Harry looked around at Ron; he looked back at Harry,
intrigued.
“Okay,” Harry said, starting off back down the corridor with
Hermione, Ron hurrying to keep up.
“Oh don’t mind me!” the Fat Lady called irritably after them.
“Don’t apologize for bothering me! I’ll just hang here, wide open,
until you get back, shall I?”
“Yeah, thanks!” Ron shouted over his shoulder.
“Hermione, where are we going?” Harry asked, after she had led


CHAPTER TWENTY-ONE
them down through six floors, and started down the marble staircase into the entrance hall.
“You’ll see, you’ll see in a minute!” said Hermione excitedly.
She turned left at the bottom of the staircase and hurried toward
the door through which Cedric Diggory had gone the night after
the Goblet of Fire had regurgitated his and Harry’s names. Harry
had never been through here before. He and Ron followed
Hermione down a flight of stone steps, but instead of ending up in
a gloomy underground passage like the one that led to Snape’s dungeon, they found themselves in a broad stone corridor, brightly lit
with torches, and decorated with cheerful paintings that were
mainly of food.
“Oh hang on . . .” said Harry slowly, halfway down the corridor.
“Wait a minute, Hermione. . . .”
“What?” She turned around to look at him, anticipation all over
her face.
“I know what this is about,” said Harry.
He nudged Ron and pointed to the painting just behind
Hermione. It showed a gigantic silver fruit bowl.
“Hermione!” said Ron, cottoning on. “You’re trying to rope us
into that spew stuff again!”
“No, no, I’m not!” she said hastily. “And it’s not spew, Ron —”
“Changed the name, have you?” said Ron, frowning at her.
“What are we now, then, the House-Elf Liberation Front? I’m not
barging into that kitchen and trying to make them stop work, I’m
not doing it —”
“I’m not asking you to!” Hermione said impatiently. “I came
down here just now, to talk to them all, and I found — oh come
on, Harry, I want to show you!”


THE HOUSE-ELF

She seized his arm again, pulled him in front of the picture of
the giant fruit bowl, stretched out her forefinger, and tickled the
huge green pear. It began to squirm, chuckling, and suddenly
turned into a large green door handle. Hermione seized it, pulled
the door open, and pushed Harry hard in the back, forcing him
inside.
He had one brief glimpse of an enormous, high-ceilinged room,
large as the Great Hall above it, with mounds of glittering brass
pots and pans heaped around the stone walls, and a great brick fireplace at the other end, when something small hurtled toward him
from the middle of the room, squealing, “Harry Potter, sir! Harry
Potter!”
Next second all the wind had been knocked out of him as the
squealing elf hit him hard in the midriff, hugging him so tightly he
thought his ribs would break.
“D-Dobby?” Harry gasped.
“It is Dobby, sir, it is!” squealed the voice from somewhere
around his navel. “Dobby has been hoping and hoping to see
Harry Potter, sir, and Harry Potter has come to see him, sir!”
Dobby let go and stepped back a few paces, beaming up at
Harry, his enormous, green, tennis-ball-shaped eyes brimming
with tears of happiness. He looked almost exactly as Harry remembered him; the pencil-shaped nose, the batlike ears, the long fingers
and feet — all except the clothes, which were very different.
When Dobby had worked for the Malfoys, he had always worn
the same filthy old pillowcase. Now, however, he was wearing the
strangest assortment of garments Harry had ever seen; he had done
an even worse job of dressing himself than the wizards at the World
Cup. He was wearing a tea cozy for a hat, on which he had pinned


375



CHAPTER TWENTY-ONE
a number of bright badges; a tie patterned with horseshoes over a
bare chest, a pair of what looked like children’s soccer shorts, and
odd socks. One of these, Harry saw, was the black one Harry had
removed from his own foot and tricked Mr. Malfoy into giving
Dobby, thereby setting Dobby free. The other was covered in pink
and orange stripes.
“Dobby, what’re you doing here?” Harry said in amazement.
“Dobby has come to work at Hogwarts, sir!” Dobby squealed
excitedly. “Professor Dumbledore gave Dobby and Winky jobs,
sir!”
“Winky?” said Harry. “She’s here too?”
“Yes, sir, yes!” said Dobby, and he seized Harry’s hand and pulled
him off into the kitchen between the four long wooden tables that
stood there. Each of these tables, Harry noticed as he passed them,
was positioned exactly beneath the four House tables above, in the
Great Hall. At the moment, they were clear of food, dinner having
finished, but he supposed that an hour ago they had been laden
with dishes that were then sent up through the ceiling to their
counterparts above.
At least a hundred little elves were standing around the kitchen,
beaming, bowing, and curtsying as Dobby led Harry past them.
They were all wearing the same uniform: a tea towel stamped with
the Hogwarts crest, and tied, as Winky’s had been, like a toga.
Dobby stopped in front of the brick fireplace and pointed.
“Winky, sir!” he said.
Winky was sitting on a stool by the fire. Unlike Dobby, she had
obviously not foraged for clothes. She was wearing a neat little skirt
and blouse with a matching blue hat, which had holes in it for her


large ears. However, while every one of Dobby’s strange collection
of garments was so clean and well cared for that it looked brandnew, Winky was plainly not taking care of her clothes at all. There
were soup stains all down her blouse and a burn in her skirt.
“Hello, Winky,” said Harry.
Winky’s lip quivered. Then she burst into tears, which spilled
out of her great brown eyes and splashed down her front, just as
they had done at the Quidditch World Cup.
“Oh dear,” said Hermione. She and Ron had followed Harry
and Dobby to the end of the kitchen. “Winky, don’t cry, please
don’t . . .”
But Winky cried harder than ever. Dobby, on the other hand,
beamed up at Harry.
“Would Harry Potter like a cup of tea?” he squeaked loudly, over
Winky’s sobs.
“Er — yeah, okay,” said Harry.
Instantly, about six house-elves came trotting up behind him,
bearing a large silver tray laden with a teapot, cups for Harry, Ron,
and Hermione, a milk jug, and a large plate of biscuits.
“Good service!” Ron said, in an impressed voice. Hermione
frowned at him, but the elves all looked delighted; they bowed very
low and retreated.
“How long have you been here, Dobby?” Harry asked as Dobby
handed around the tea.
“Only a week, Harry Potter, sir!” said Dobby happily. “Dobby
came to see Professor Dumbledore, sir. You see, sir, it is very difficult for a house-elf who has been dismissed to get a new position,
sir, very difficult indeed —”


377



CHAPTER TWENTY-ONE
At this, Winky howled even harder, her squashed-tomato of a
nose dribbling all down her front, though she made no effort to
stem the flow.
“Dobby has traveled the country for two whole years, sir, trying
to find work!” Dobby squeaked. “But Dobby hasn’t found work,
sir, because Dobby wants paying now!”
The house-elves all around the kitchen, who had been listening
and watching with interest, all looked away at these words, as
though Dobby had said something rude and embarrassing.
Hermione, however, said, “Good for you, Dobby!”
“Thank you, miss!” said Dobby, grinning toothily at her. “But
most wizards doesn’t want a house-elf who wants paying, miss.
‘That’s not the point of a house-elf,’ they says, and they slammed
the door in Dobby’s face! Dobby likes work, but he wants to wear
clothes and he wants to be paid, Harry Potter. . . . Dobby likes being free!”
The Hogwarts house-elves had now started edging away from
Dobby, as though he were carrying something contagious. Winky,
however, remained where she was, though there was a definite increase in the volume of her crying.
“And then, Harry Potter, Dobby goes to visit Winky, and finds
out Winky has been freed too, sir!” said Dobby delightedly.
At this, Winky flung herself forward off her stool and lay facedown on the flagged stone floor, beating her tiny fists upon it and
positively screaming with misery. Hermione hastily dropped down
to her knees beside her and tried to comfort her, but nothing she
said made the slightest difference. Dobby continued with his story,
shouting shrilly over Winky’s screeches.
“And then Dobby had the idea, Harry Potter, sir! ‘Why doesn’t


378



THE HOUSE-ELF
LIBERATION FRONT
Dobby and Winky find work together?’ Dobby says. ‘Where is
there enough work for two house-elves?’ says Winky. And Dobby
thinks, and it comes to him, sir! Hogwarts! So Dobby and Winky
came to see Professor Dumbledore, sir, and Professor Dumbledore
took us on!”
Dobby beamed very brightly, and happy tears welled in his eyes
again.
“And Professor Dumbledore says he will pay Dobby, sir, if
Dobby wants paying! And so Dobby is a free elf, sir, and Dobby
gets a Galleon a week and one day off a month!”
“That’s not very much!” Hermione shouted indignantly from
the floor, over Winky’s continued screaming and fist-beating.
“Professor Dumbledore offered Dobby ten Galleons a week, and
weekends off,” said Dobby, suddenly giving a little shiver, as
though the prospect of so much leisure and riches were frightening,
“but Dobby beat him down, miss. . . . Dobby likes freedom, miss,
but he isn’t wanting too much, miss, he likes work better.”
“And how much is Professor Dumbledore paying you, Winky?”
Hermione asked kindly.
If she had thought this would cheer up Winky, she was wildly
mistaken. Winky did stop crying, but when she sat up she was glaring at Hermione through her massive brown eyes, her whole face
sopping wet and suddenly furious.
“Winky is a disgraced elf, but Winky is not yet getting paid!” she
squeaked. “Winky is not sunk so low as that! Winky is properly
ashamed of being freed!”
“Ashamed?” said Hermione blankly. “But — Winky, come on!
It’s Mr. Crouch who should be ashamed, not you! You didn’t do
anything wrong, he was really horrible to you —”


379

CHAPTER TWENTY-ONE
But at these words, Winky clapped her hands over the holes in
her hat, flattening her ears so that she couldn’t hear a word, and
screeched, “You is not insulting my master, miss! You is not insulting Mr. Crouch! Mr. Crouch is a good wizard, miss! Mr. Crouch is
right to sack bad Winky!”
“Winky is having trouble adjusting, Harry Potter,” squeaked
Dobby confidentially. “Winky forgets she is not bound to Mr.
Crouch anymore; she is allowed to speak her mind now, but she
won’t do it.”
“Can’t house-elves speak their minds about their masters, then?”
Harry asked.
“Oh no, sir, no,” said Dobby, looking suddenly serious. “ ’Tis
part of the house-elf ’s enslavement, sir. We keeps their secrets and
our silence, sir. We upholds the family’s honor, and we never speaks
ill of them — though Professor Dumbledore told Dobby he does
not insist upon this. Professor Dumbledore said we is free to —
to —”
Dobby looked suddenly nervous and beckoned Harry closer.
Harry bent forward. Dobby whispered, “He said we is free to call
him a — a barmy old codger if we likes, sir!”
Dobby gave a frightened sort of giggle.
“But Dobby is not wanting to, Harry Potter,” he said, talking
normally again, and shaking his head so that his ears flapped.
“Dobby likes Professor Dumbledore very much, sir, and is proud
to keep his secrets and our silence for him.”
“But you can say what you like about the Malfoys now?” Harry
asked him, grinning.
A slightly fearful look came into Dobby’s immense eyes.
“Dobby — Dobby could,” he said doubtfully. He squared his


THE HOUSE-ELF
LIBERATION FRONT
small shoulders. “Dobby could tell Harry Potter that his old masters were — were — bad Dark wizards!”
Dobby stood for a moment, quivering all over, horror-struck by
his own daring — then he rushed over to the nearest table and began banging his head on it very hard, squealing, “Bad Dobby! Bad
Dobby!”
Harry seized Dobby by the back of his tie and pulled him away
from the table.
“Thank you, Harry Potter, thank you,” said Dobby breathlessly,
rubbing his head.
“You just need a bit of practice,” Harry said.
“Practice!” squealed Winky furiously. “You is ought to be
ashamed of yourself, Dobby, talking that way about your masters!”
“They isn’t my masters anymore, Winky!” said Dobby defiantly.
“Dobby doesn’t care what they think anymore!”
“Oh you is a bad elf, Dobby!” moaned Winky, tears leaking
down her face once more. “My poor Mr. Crouch, what is he doing
without Winky? He is needing me, he is needing my help! I is looking after the Crouches all my life, and my mother is doing it before
me, and my grandmother is doing it before her . . . oh what is they
saying if they knew Winky was freed? Oh the shame, the shame!”
She buried her face in her skirt again and bawled.
“Winky,” said Hermione firmly, “I’m quite sure Mr. Crouch is getting along perfectly well without you. We’ve seen him, you know —”
“You is seeing my master?” said Winky breathlessly, raising her
tearstained face out of her skirt once more and goggling at
Hermione. “You is seeing him here at Hogwarts?”
“Yes,” said Hermione, “he and Mr. Bagman are judges in the Triwizard Tournament.”


381



CHAPTER TWENTY-ONE
“Mr. Bagman comes too?” squeaked Winky, and to Harry’s great
surprise (and Ron’s and Hermione’s too, by the looks on their
faces), she looked angry again. “Mr. Bagman is a bad wizard! A very
bad wizard! My master isn’t liking him, oh no, not at all!”
“Bagman — bad?” said Harry.
“Oh yes,” Winky said, nodding her head furiously. “My master
is telling Winky some things! But Winky is not saying . . .
Winky — Winky keeps her master’s secrets. . . .”
She dissolved yet again in tears; they could hear her sobbing into
her skirt, “Poor master, poor master, no Winky to help him no
more!
They couldn’t get another sensible word out of Winky. They left
her to her crying and finished their tea, while Dobby chatted happily about his life as a free elf and his plans for his wages.
“Dobby is going to buy a sweater next, Harry Potter!” he said
happily, pointing at his bare chest.
“Tell you what, Dobby,” said Ron, who seemed to have taken a
great liking to the elf, “I’ll give you the one my mum knits me this
Christmas, I always get one from her. You don’t mind maroon, do
you?”
Dobby was delighted.
“We might have to shrink it a bit to fit you,” Ron told him, “but
it’ll go well with your tea cozy.”
As they prepared to take their leave, many of the surrounding
elves pressed in upon them, offering snacks to take back upstairs.
Hermione refused, with a pained look at the way the elves kept
bowing and curtsying, but Harry and Ron loaded their pockets
with cream cakes and pies.


“Thanks a lot!” Harry said to the elves, who had all clustered
around the door to say good night. “See you, Dobby!”
“Harry Potter . . . can Dobby come and see you sometimes, sir?”
Dobby asked tentatively.
“ ’Course you can,” said Harry, and Dobby beamed.
“You know what?” said Ron, once he, Hermione, and Harry had
left the kitchens behind and were climbing the steps into the entrance hall again. “All these years I’ve been really impressed with
Fred and George, nicking food from the kitchens — well, it’s not
exactly difficult, is it? They can’t wait to give it away!”
“I think this is the best thing that could have happened to those
elves, you know,” said Hermione, leading the way back up the marble staircase. “Dobby coming to work here, I mean. The other elves
will see how happy he is, being free, and slowly it’ll dawn on them
that they want that too!”
“Let’s hope they don’t look too closely at Winky,” said Harry.
“Oh she’ll cheer up,” said Hermione, though she sounded a bit
doubtful. “Once the shock’s worn off, and she’s got used to Hogwarts, she’ll see how much better off she is without that Crouch
man.”
“She seems to love him,” said Ron thickly (he had just started on
a cream cake).
“Doesn’t think much of Bagman, though, does she?” said Harry.
“Wonder what Crouch says at home about him?”
“Probably says he’s not a very good Head of Department,” said
Hermione, “and let’s face it . . . he’s got a point, hasn’t he?”
“I’d still rather work for him than old Crouch,” said Ron. “At
least Bagman’s got a sense of humor.”

“Don’t let Percy hear you saying that,” Hermione said, smiling
slightly.
“Yeah, well, Percy wouldn’t want to work for anyone with a sense

“Percy wouldn’t recognize a joke if it danced naked in front of him
wearing Dobby’s tea cozy.”

THE UNEXPECTED TASK

P

otter! Weasley! Will you pay attention?”
Professor McGonagall’s irritated voice cracked like a whip
through the Transfiguration class on Thursday, and Harry and Ron
both jumped and looked up.
It was the end of the lesson; they had finished their work; the
guinea fowl they had been changing into guinea pigs had been shut
away in a large cage on Professor McGonagall’s desk (Neville’s still
had feathers); they had copied down their homework from the
blackboard (“Describe, with examples, the ways in which Transforming Spells must be adapted when performing Cross-Species Switches”).
The bell was due to ring at any moment, and Harry and Ron, who
had been having a sword fight with a couple of Fred and George’s
fake wands at the back of the class, looked up, Ron holding a tin
parrot and Harry, a rubber haddock.
“Now that Potter and Weasley have been kind enough to act

CHAPTER TWENTY-TWO
their age,” said Professor McGonagall, with an angry look at the
pair of them as the head of Harry’s haddock drooped and fell
silently to the floor — Ron’s parrot’s beak had severed it moments
before — “I have something to say to you all.
“The Yule Ball is approaching — a traditional part of the Triwizard Tournament and an opportunity for us to socialize with our
foreign guests. Now, the ball will be open only to fourth years and
above — although you may invite a younger student if you
wish —”
Lavender Brown let out a shrill giggle. Parvati Patil nudged her
hard in the ribs, her face working furiously as she too fought not to
giggle. They both looked around at Harry. Professor McGonagall
ignored them, which Harry thought was distinctly unfair, as she
had just told off him and Ron.
“Dress robes will be worn,” Professor McGonagall continued,
“and the ball will start at eight o’clock on Christmas Day, finishing
at midnight in the Great Hall. Now then —”
Professor McGonagall stared deliberately around the class.
“The Yule Ball is of course a chance for us all to — er — let our
hair down,” she said, in a disapproving voice.
Lavender giggled harder than ever, with her hand pressed hard
against her mouth to stifle the sound. Harry could see what was
funny this time: Professor McGonagall, with her hair in a tight
bun, looked as though she had never let her hair down in any sense.
“But that does NOT mean,” Professor McGonagall went on,
“that we will be relaxing the standards of behavior we expect from
Hogwarts students. I will be most seriously displeased if a Gryffindor student embarrasses the school in any way.”


386



THE UNEXPECTED TASK
The bell rang, and there was the usual scuffle of activity as everyone packed their bags and swung them onto their shoulders.
Professor McGonagall called above the noise, “Potter — a word,
if you please.”
Assuming this had something to do with his headless rubber
haddock, Harry proceeded gloomily to the teacher’s desk. Professor
McGonagall waited until the rest of the class had gone, and then
said, “Potter, the champions and their partners —”
“What partners?” said Harry.
Professor McGonagall looked suspiciously at him, as though she
thought he was trying to be funny.
“Your partners for the Yule Ball, Potter,” she said coldly. “Your
dance partners.”
Harry’s insides seemed to curl up and shrivel.
“Dance partners?” He felt himself going red. “I don’t dance,” he
said quickly.
“Oh yes, you do,” said Professor McGonagall irritably. “That’s
what I’m telling you. Traditionally, the champions and their partners open the ball.”
Harry had a sudden mental image of himself in a top hat and
tails, accompanied by a girl in the sort of frilly dress Aunt Petunia
always wore to Uncle Vernon’s work parties.
“I’m not dancing,” he said.
“It is traditional,” said Professor McGonagall firmly. “You are a
Hogwarts champion, and you will do what is expected of you as a
representative of the school. So make sure you get yourself a partner, Potter.”
“But — I don’t —”


387



CHAPTER TWENTY-TWO
“You heard me, Potter,” said Professor McGonagall in a very
final sort of way.
A week ago, Harry would have said finding a partner for a dance
would be a cinch compared to taking on a Hungarian Horntail.
But now that he had done the latter, and was facing the prospect of
asking a girl to the ball, he thought he’d rather have another round
with the dragon.
Harry had never known so many people to put their names
down to stay at Hogwarts for Christmas; he always did, of course,
because the alternative was usually going back to Privet Drive, but
he had always been very much in the minority before now. This
year, however, everyone in the fourth year and above seemed to be
staying, and they all seemed to Harry to be obsessed with the coming ball — or at least all the girls were, and it was amazing how
many girls Hogwarts suddenly seemed to hold; he had never quite
noticed that before. Girls giggling and whispering in the corridors,
girls shrieking with laughter as boys passed them, girls excitedly
comparing notes on what they were going to wear on Christmas
night. . . .
“Why do they have to move in packs?” Harry asked Ron as a
dozen or so girls walked past them, sniggering and staring at Harry.
“How’re you supposed to get one on their own to ask them?”
“Lasso one?” Ron suggested. “Got any idea who you’re going to
try?”
Harry didn’t answer. He knew perfectly well whom he’d like to
ask, but working up the nerve was something else. . . . Cho was a
year older than he was; she was very pretty; she was a very good
Quidditch player, and she was also very popular.


388



THE UNEXPECTED TASK
Ron seemed to know what was going on inside Harry’s head.
“Listen, you’re not going to have any trouble. You’re a champion. You’ve just beaten a Hungarian Horntail. I bet they’ll be
queuing up to go with you.”
In tribute to their recently repaired friendship, Ron had kept the
bitterness in his voice to a bare minimum. Moreover, to Harry’s
amazement, he turned out to be quite right.
A curly-haired third-year Hufflepuff girl to whom Harry had
never spoken in his life asked him to go to the ball with her the very
next day. Harry was so taken aback he said no before he’d even
stopped to consider the matter. The girl walked off looking rather
hurt, and Harry had to endure Dean’s, Seamus’s, and Ron’s taunts
about her all through History of Magic. The following day, two
more girls asked him, a second year and (to his horror) a fifth year
who looked as though she might knock him out if he refused.
“She was quite good-looking,” said Ron fairly, after he’d stopped
laughing.
“She was a foot taller than me,” said Harry, still unnerved.
“Imagine what I’d look like trying to dance with her.”
Hermione’s words about Krum kept coming back to him. “They
only like him because he’s famous!” Harry doubted very much if
any of the girls who had asked to be his partner so far would have
wanted to go to the ball with him if he hadn’t been a school champion. Then he wondered if this would bother him if Cho asked
him.
On the whole, Harry had to admit that even with the embarrassing prospect of opening the ball before him, life had definitely
improved since he had got through the first task. He wasn’t attracting nearly as much unpleasantness in the corridors anymore, which


389

CHAPTER TWENTY-TWO
he suspected had a lot to do with Cedric — he had an idea Cedric
might have told the Hufflepuffs to leave Harry alone, in gratitude
for Harry’s tip-off about the dragons. There seemed to be fewer
Support Cedric Diggory! badges around too. Draco Malfoy, of
course, was still quoting Rita Skeeter’s article to him at every possible opportunity, but he was getting fewer and fewer laughs out of
it — and just to heighten Harry’s feeling of well-being, no story
about Hagrid had appeared in the Daily Prophet.
“She didn’ seem very int’rested in magical creatures, ter tell yeh
the truth,” Hagrid said, when Harry, Ron, and Hermione asked
him how his interview with Rita Skeeter had gone during the last
Care of Magical Creatures lesson of the term. To their very great
relief, Hagrid had given up on direct contact with the skrewts now,
and they were merely sheltering behind his cabin today, sitting at a
trestle table and preparing a fresh selection of food with which to
tempt the skrewts.
“She jus’ wanted me ter talk about you, Harry,” Hagrid continued in a low voice. “Well, I told her we’d been friends since I went
ter fetch yeh from the Dursleys. ‘Never had to tell him off in four
years?’ she said. ‘Never played you up in lessons, has he?’ I told her
no, an’ she didn’ seem happy at all. Yeh’d think she wanted me to
say yeh were horrible, Harry.”
“ ’Course she did,” said Harry, throwing lumps of dragon liver
into a large metal bowl and picking up his knife to cut some more.
“She can’t keep writing about what a tragic little hero I am, it’ll get
boring.”
“She wants a new angle, Hagrid,” said Ron wisely as he shelled
salamander eggs. “You were supposed to say Harry’s a mad delinquent!”




THE UNEXPECTED TASK
“But he’s not!” said Hagrid, looking genuinely shocked.
“She should’ve interviewed Snape,” said Harry grimly. “He’d
give her the goods on me any day. ‘Potter has been crossing lines ever
since he first arrived at this school. . . .’ ”
“Said that, did he?” said Hagrid, while Ron and Hermione
laughed. “Well, yeh might’ve bent a few rules, Harry, bu’ yeh’re all
righ’ really, aren’ you?”
“Cheers, Hagrid,” said Harry, grinning.
“You coming to this ball thing on Christmas Day, Hagrid?” said
Ron.
“Though’ I might look in on it, yeah,” said Hagrid gruffly.
“Should be a good do, I reckon. You’ll be openin’ the dancin’, won’
yeh, Harry? Who’re you takin’?”
“No one, yet,” said Harry, feeling himself going red again. Hagrid didn’t pursue the subject.
The last week of term became increasingly boisterous as it progressed. Rumors about the Yule Ball were flying everywhere,

Dumbledore had bought eight hundred barrels of mulled mead
from Madam Rosmerta. It seemed to be fact, however, that he had
booked the Weird Sisters. Exactly who or what the Weird Sisters
were Harry didn’t know, never having had access to a wizard’s wireless, but he deduced from the wild excitement of those who had
grown up listening to the WWN (Wizarding Wireless Network)
that they were a very famous musical group.
Some of the teachers, like little Professor Flitwick, gave up trying
to teach them much when their minds were so clearly elsewhere; he
allowed them to play games in his lesson on Wednesday, and spent
most of it talking to Harry about the perfect Summoning Charm

Other teachers were not so generous. Nothing would ever deflect
Professor Binns, for example, from plowing on through his notes
on goblin rebellions — as Binns hadn’t let his own death stand in
the way of continuing to teach, they supposed a small thing like

There was a commotion. We managed to subdue him just in time.
Forced him into a compartment of his own magical trunk. Took
some of his hair and added it to the potion. I drank it; I became
Moody’s double. I took his leg and his eye. I was ready to face
Arthur Weasley when he arrived to sort out the Muggles who had
heard a disturbance. I made the dustbins move around the yard. I
told Arthur Weasley I had heard intruders in my yard, who had set
off the dustbins. Then I packed up Moody’s clothes and Dark
detectors, put them in the trunk with Moody, and set off for Hogwarts. I kept him alive, under the Imperius Curse. I wanted to be
able to question him. To find out about his past, learn his habits, so
that I could fool even Dumbledore. I also needed his hair to make
the Polyjuice Potion. The other ingredients were easy. I stole boomslang skin from the dungeons. When the Potions master found me
in his office, I said I was under orders to search it.”
“And what became of Wormtail after you attacked Moody?” said
Dumbledore.
“Wormtail returned to care for my master, in my father’s house,
and to keep watch over my father.”
“But your father escaped,” said Dumbledore.
“Yes. After a while he began to fight the Imperius Curse just as I
had done. There were periods when he knew what was happening.
My master decided it was no longer safe for my father to leave the
house. He forced him to send letters to the Ministry instead. He
made him write and say he was ill. But Wormtail neglected his
duty. He was not watchful enough. My father escaped. My master
guessed that he was heading for Hogwarts. My father was going to
tell Dumbledore everything, to confess. He was going to admit
that he had smuggled me from Azkaban.

“My master sent me word of my father’s escape. He told me to
stop him at all costs. So I waited and watched. I used the map I had
taken from Harry Potter. The map that had almost ruined
everything.”
“Map?” said Dumbledore quickly. “What map is this?”
“Potter’s map of Hogwarts. Potter saw me on it. Potter saw me
stealing more ingredients for the Polyjuice Potion from Snape’s office one night. He thought I was my father. We have the same first
name. I took the map from Potter that night. I told him my father
hated Dark wizards. Potter believed my father was after Snape.
“For a week I waited for my father to arrive at Hogwarts. At last,
one evening, the map showed my father entering the grounds. I
pulled on my Invisibility Cloak and went down to meet him. He
was walking around the edge of the forest. Then Potter came, and
Krum. I waited. I could not hurt Potter; my master needed him.
Potter ran to get Dumbledore. I Stunned Krum. I killed my father.”
“Noooo!” wailed Winky. “Master Barty, Master Barty, what is
you saying?”
“You killed your father,” Dumbledore said, in the same soft
voice. “What did you do with the body?”
“Carried it into the forest. Covered it with the Invisibility Cloak.
I had the map with me. I watched Potter run into the castle. He
met Snape. Dumbledore joined them. I watched Potter bringing
Dumbledore out of the castle. I walked back out of the forest, doubled around behind them, went to meet them. I told Dumbledore
Snape had told me where to come.
“Dumbledore told me to go and look for my father. I went back
to my father’s body. Watched the map. When everyone was gone, I

while wearing the Invisibility Cloak, in the freshly dug earth in
front of Hagrid’s cabin.”
There was complete silence now, except for Winky’s continued
sobs. Then Dumbledore said, “And tonight . . .”
“I offered to carry the Triwizard Cup into the maze before dinner,” whispered Barty Crouch. “Turned it into a Portkey. My master’s plan worked. He is returned to power and I will be honored by
him beyond the dreams of wizards.”
The insane smile lit his features once more, and his head
drooped onto his shoulder as Winky wailed and sobbed at his side.

umbledore stood up. He stared down at Barty Crouch for a
moment with disgust on his face. Then he raised his wand
once more and ropes flew out of it, ropes that twisted themselves
around Barty Crouch, binding him tightly. He turned to Professor
McGonagall.
“Minerva, could I ask you to stand guard here while I take Harry
upstairs?”
“Of course,” said Professor McGonagall. She looked slightly
nauseous, as though she had just watched someone being sick.
However, when she drew out her wand and pointed it at Barty
Crouch, her hand was quite steady.
“Severus” — Dumbledore turned to Snape — “please tell Madam
Pomfrey to come down here; we need to get Alastor Moody into
the hospital wing. Then go down into the grounds, find Cornelius
Fudge, and bring him up to this office. He will undoubtedly want




THE PARTING OF

to question Crouch himself. Tell him I will be in the hospital wing
in half an hour’s time if he needs me.”
Snape nodded silently and swept out of the room.
“Harry?” Dumbledore said gently.
Harry got up and swayed again; the pain in his leg, which he had
not noticed all the time he had been listening to Crouch, now returned in full measure. He also realized that he was shaking. Dumbledore gripped his arm and helped him out into the dark corridor.
“I want you to come up to my office first, Harry,” he said quietly
as they headed up the passageway. “Sirius is waiting for us there.”
Harry nodded. A kind of numbness and a sense of complete unreality were upon him, but he did not care; he was even glad of it.
He didn’t want to have to think about anything that had happened
since he had first touched the Triwizard Cup. He didn’t want to
have to examine the memories, fresh and sharp as photographs,
which kept flashing across his mind. Mad-Eye Moody, inside the
trunk. Wormtail, slumped on the ground, cradling his stump of an
arm. Voldemort, rising from the steaming cauldron. Cedric . . .
dead . . . Cedric, asking to be returned to his parents. . . .
“Professor,” Harry mumbled, “where are Mr. and Mrs.
Diggory?”
“They are with Professor Sprout,” said Dumbledore. His voice,
which had been so calm throughout the interrogation of Barty
Crouch, shook very slightly for the first time. “She was Head of
Cedric’s house, and knew him best.”
They had reached the stone gargoyle. Dumbledore gave the
password, it sprang aside, and he and Harry went up the moving
spiral staircase to the oak door. Dumbledore pushed it open. Sirius

CHAPTER THIRTY-SIX
was standing there. His face was white and gaunt as it had been
when he had escaped Azkaban. In one swift moment, he had
crossed the room.
“Harry, are you all right? I knew it — I knew something like
this — what happened?”
His hands shook as he helped Harry into a chair in front of the
desk.
“What happened?” he asked more urgently
Dumbledore began to tell Sirius everything Barty Crouch had
said. Harry was only half listening. So tired every bone in his body
was aching, he wanted nothing more than to sit here, undisturbed,
for hours and hours, until he fell asleep and didn’t have to think or
feel anymore.
There was a soft rush of wings. Fawkes the phoenix had left his
perch, flown across the office, and landed on Harry’s knee.
“ ’Lo, Fawkes,” said Harry quietly. He stroked the phoenix’s
beautiful scarlet-and-gold plumage. Fawkes blinked peacefully up
at him. There was something comforting about his warm weight.
Dumbledore stopped talking. He sat down opposite Harry, behind his desk. He was looking at Harry, who avoided his eyes.
Dumbledore was going to question him. He was going to make
Harry relive everything.
“I need to know what happened after you touched the Portkey
in the maze, Harry,” said Dumbledore.
“We can leave that till morning, can’t we, Dumbledore?” said
Sirius harshly. He had put a hand on Harry’s shoulder. “Let him
have a sleep. Let him rest.”
Harry felt a rush of gratitude toward Sirius, but Dumbledore
took no notice of Sirius’s words. He leaned forward toward Harry.


694



THE PARTING OF
THE WAYS
Very unwillingly, Harry raised his head and looked into those blue
eyes.
“If I thought I could help you,” Dumbledore said gently, “by
putting you into an enchanted sleep and allowing you to postpone
the moment when you would have to think about what has happened tonight, I would do it. But I know better. Numbing the pain
for a while will make it worse when you finally feel it. You have
shown bravery beyond anything I could have expected of you. I ask
you to demonstrate your courage one more time. I ask you to tell
us what happened.”
The phoenix let out one soft, quavering note. It shivered in the
air, and Harry felt as though a drop of hot liquid had slipped down
his throat into his stomach, warming him, and strengthening him.
He took a deep breath and began to tell them. As he spoke, visions of everything that had passed that night seemed to rise before
his eyes; he saw the sparkling surface of the potion that had revived
Voldemort; he saw the Death Eaters Apparating between the graves
around them; he saw Cedric’s body, lying on the ground beside the
cup.
Once or twice, Sirius made a noise as though about to say something, his hand still tight on Harry’s shoulder, but Dumbledore
raised his hand to stop him, and Harry was glad of this, because it
was easier to keep going now he had started. It was even a relief; he
felt almost as though something poisonous were being extracted
from him. It was costing him every bit of determination he had to
keep talking, yet he sensed that once he had finished, he would feel
better.
When Harry told of Wormtail piercing his arm with the dagger,
however, Sirius let out a vehement exclamation and Dumbledore


695



CHAPTER THIRTY-SIX
stood up so quickly that Harry started. Dumbledore walked around
the desk and told Harry to stretch out his arm. Harry showed them
both the place where his robes were torn and the cut beneath them.
“He said my blood would make him stronger than if he’d used
someone else’s,” Harry told Dumbledore. “He said the protection
my — my mother left in me — he’d have it too. And he was
right — he could touch me without hurting himself, he touched
my face.”
For a fleeting instant, Harry thought he saw a gleam of something like triumph in Dumbledore’s eyes. But next second, Harry
was sure he had imagined it, for when Dumbledore had returned
to his seat behind the desk, he looked as old and weary as Harry
had ever seen him.
“Very well,” he said, sitting down again. “Voldemort has overcome that particular barrier. Harry, continue, please.”
Harry went on; he explained how Voldemort had emerged from
the cauldron, and told them all he could remember of Voldemort’s
speech to the Death Eaters. Then he told how Voldemort had untied him, returned his wand to him, and prepared to duel.
But when he reached the part where the golden beam of light
had connected his and Voldemort’s wands, he found his throat obstructed. He tried to keep talking, but the memories of what had
come out of Voldemort’s wand were flooding into his mind. He
could see Cedric emerging, see the old man, Bertha Jorkins . . . his
father . . . his mother . . .
He was glad when Sirius broke the silence.
“The wands connected?” he said, looking from Harry to Dumbledore. “Why?”


696



THE PARTING OF
THE WAYS
Harry looked up at Dumbledore again, on whose face there was
an arrested look.
“Priori Incantatem,” he muttered.
His eyes gazed into Harry’s and it was almost as though an invisible beam of understanding shot between them.
“The Reverse Spell effect?” said Sirius sharply.
“Exactly,” said Dumbledore. “Harry’s wand and Voldemort’s
wand share cores. Each of them contains a feather from the tail of
the same phoenix. This phoenix, in fact,” he added, and he pointed
at the scarlet-and-gold bird, perching peacefully on Harry’s knee.
“My wand’s feather came from Fawkes?” Harry said, amazed.
“Yes,” said Dumbledore. “Mr. Ollivander wrote to tell me you
had bought the second wand, the moment you left his shop four
years ago.”
“So what happens when a wand meets its brother?” said Sirius.
“They will not work properly against each other,” said Dumbledore. “If, however, the owners of the wands force the wands to
do battle . . . a very rare effect will take place. One of the wands
will force the other to regurgitate spells it has performed — in reverse. The most recent first . . . and then those which preceded
it. . . .”
He looked interrogatively at Harry, and Harry nodded.
“Which means,” said Dumbledore slowly, his eyes upon Harry’s
face, “that some form of Cedric must have reappeared.”
Harry nodded again.
“Diggory came back to life?” said Sirius sharply.
“No spell can reawaken the dead,” said Dumbledore heavily. “All
that would have happened is a kind of reverse echo. A shadow of

697



CHAPTER THIRTY-SIX
the living Cedric would have emerged from the wand . . . am I correct, Harry?”
“He spoke to me,” Harry said. He was suddenly shaking again.
“The . . . the ghost Cedric, or whatever he was, spoke.”
“An echo,” said Dumbledore, “which retained Cedric’s appearance and character. I am guessing other such forms appeared . . .
less recent victims of Voldemort’s wand. . . .”
“An old man,” Harry said, his throat still constricted. “Bertha
Jorkins. And . . .”
“Your parents?” said Dumbledore quietly.
“Yes,” said Harry.
Sirius’s grip on Harry’s shoulder was now so tight it was painful.
“The last murders the wand performed,” said Dumbledore,
nodding. “In reverse order. More would have appeared, of course,
had you maintained the connection. Very well, Harry, these
echoes, these shadows . . . what did they do?”
Harry described how the figures that had emerged from the
wand had prowled the edges of the golden web, how Voldemort
had seemed to fear them, how the shadow of Harry’s father had
told him what to do, how Cedric’s had made its final request.
At this point, Harry found he could not continue. He looked
around at Sirius and saw that he had his face in his hands.
Harry suddenly became aware that Fawkes had left his knee. The
phoenix had fluttered to the floor. It was resting its beautiful head
against Harry’s injured leg, and thick, pearly tears were falling from
its eyes onto the wound left by the spider. The pain vanished. The
skin mended. His leg was repaired.
“I will say it again,” said Dumbledore as the phoenix rose into
the air and resettled itself upon the perch beside the door. “You




THE PARTING OF
THE WAYS
have shown bravery beyond anything I could have expected of you
tonight, Harry. You have shown bravery equal to those who died
fighting Voldemort at the height of his powers. You have shouldered a grown wizard’s burden and found yourself equal to it —
and you have now given us all that we have a right to expect. You will
come with me to the hospital wing. I do not want you returning to
the dormitory tonight. A Sleeping Potion, and some peace . . . Sirius, would you like to stay with him?”
Sirius nodded and stood up. He transformed back into the great
black dog and walked with Harry and Dumbledore out of the office, accompanying them down a flight of stairs to the hospital
wing.
When Dumbledore pushed open the door, Harry saw Mrs.
Weasley, Bill, Ron, and Hermione grouped around a harassedlooking Madam Pomfrey. They appeared to be demanding to know
where Harry was and what had happened to him. All of them
whipped around as Harry, Dumbledore, and the black dog entered, and Mrs. Weasley let out a kind of muffled scream.
“Harry! Oh Harry!”
She started to hurry toward him, but Dumbledore moved between them.
“Molly,” he said, holding up a hand, “please listen to me for a
moment. Harry has been through a terrible ordeal tonight. He has
just had to relive it for me. What he needs now is sleep, and peace,
and quiet. If he would like you all to stay with him,” he added,
looking around at Ron, Hermione, and Bill too, “you may do so.
But I do not want you questioning him until he is ready to answer,
and certainly not this evening.”
Mrs. Weasley nodded. She was very white. She rounded on Ron,


699

CHAPTER THIRTY-SIX
Hermione, and Bill as though they were being noisy, and hissed,
“Did you hear? He needs quiet!”
“Headmaster,” said Madam Pomfrey, staring at the great black
dog that was Sirius, “may I ask what — ?”
“This dog will be remaining with Harry for a while,” said Dumbledore simply. “I assure you, he is extremely well trained.
Harry — I will wait while you get into bed.”
Harry felt an inexpressible sense of gratitude to Dumbledore
for asking the others not to question him. It wasn’t as though he
didn’t want them there; but the thought of explaining it all over
again, the idea of reliving it one more time, was more than he could
stand.
“I will be back to see you as soon as I have met with Fudge,
Harry,” said Dumbledore. “I would like you to remain here tomorrow until I have spoken to the school.” He left.
As Madam Pomfrey led Harry to a nearby bed, he caught sight
of the real Moody lying motionless in a bed at the far end of the
room. His wooden leg and magical eye were lying on the bedside
table.
“Is he okay?” Harry asked.
“He’ll be fine,” said Madam Pomfrey, giving Harry some pajamas and pulling screens around him. He took off his robes, pulled
on the pajamas, and got into bed. Ron, Hermione, Bill, Mrs.
Weasley, and the black dog came around the screen and settled
themselves in chairs on either side of him. Ron and Hermione were
looking at him almost cautiously, as though scared of him.
“I’m all right,” he told them. “Just tired.”
Mrs. Weasley’s eyes filled with tears as she smoothed his bedcovers unnecessarily.

Madam Pomfrey, who had bustled off to her office, returned
holding a small bottle of some purple potion and a goblet.
“You’ll need to drink all of this, Harry,” she said. “It’s a potion
for dreamless sleep.”
Harry took the goblet and drank a few mouthfuls. He felt himself becoming drowsy at once. Everything around him became
hazy; the lamps around the hospital wing seemed to be winking at
him in a friendly way through the screen around his bed; his body
felt as though it was sinking deeper into the warmth of the feather
matress. Before he could finish the potion, before he could say another word, his exhaustion had carried him off to sleep.
Harry woke up, so warm, so very sleepy, that he didn’t open his
eyes, wanting to drop off again. The room was still dimly lit; he was
sure it was still nighttime and had a feeling that he couldn’t have
been asleep very long.
Then he heard whispering around him.
“They’ll wake him if they don’t shut up!”
“What are they shouting about? Nothing else can have happened, can it?”
Harry opened his eyes blearily Someone had removed his
glasses. He could see the fuzzy outlines of Mrs. Weasley and Bill
close by. Mrs. Weasley was on her feet.
“That’s Fudge’s voice,” she whispered. “And that’s Minerva
McGonagall’s, isn’t it? But what are they arguing about?”
Now Harry could hear them too: people shouting and running
toward the hospital wing.
“Regrettable, but all the same, Minerva —” Cornelius Fudge
was saying loudly.


701



CHAPTER THIRTY-SIX
“You should never have brought it inside the castle!” yelled Professor McGonagall. “When Dumbledore finds out —”
Harry heard the hospital doors burst open. Unnoticed by any of
the people around his bed, all of whom were staring at the door as
Bill pulled back the screens, Harry sat up and put his glasses back on.
Fudge came striding up the ward. Professors McGonagall and
Snape were at his heels.
“Where’s Dumbledore?” Fudge demanded of Mrs. Weasley.
“He’s not here,” said Mrs. Weasley angrily. “This is a hospital
wing, Minister, don’t you think you’d do better to —”
But the door opened, and Dumbledore came sweeping up the
ward.
“What has happened?” said Dumbledore sharply, looking from
Fudge to Professor McGonagall. “Why are you disturbing these
people? Minerva, I’m surprised at you — I asked you to stand
guard over Barty Crouch —”
“There is no need to stand guard over him anymore, Dumbledore!” she shrieked. “The Minister has seen to that!”
Harry had never seen Professor McGonagall lose control like
this. There were angry blotches of color in her cheeks, and her
hands were balled into fists; she was trembling with fury.
“When we told Mr. Fudge that we had caught the Death Eater
responsible for tonight’s events,” said Snape, in a low voice, “he
seemed to feel his personal safety was in question. He insisted on
summoning a dementor to accompany him into the castle. He
brought it up to the office where Barty Crouch —”
“I told him you would not agree, Dumbledore!” Professor
McGonagall fumed. “I told him you would never allow dementors
to set foot inside the castle, but —”

“My dear woman!” roared Fudge, who likewise looked angrier
than Harry had ever seen him, “as Minister of Magic, it is my decision whether I wish to bring protection with me when interviewing a possibly dangerous —”
But Professor McGonagall’s voice drowned Fudge’s.
“The moment that — that thing entered the room,” she
screamed, pointing at Fudge, trembling all over, “it swooped down
on Crouch and — and —”
Harry felt a chill in his stomach as Professor McGonagall struggled to find words to describe what had happened. He did not need
her to finish her sentence. He knew what the dementor must have
done. It had administered its fatal kiss to Barty Crouch. It had
sucked his soul out through his mouth. He was worse than dead.
“By all accounts, he is no loss!” blustered Fudge. “It seems he has
been responsible for several deaths!”
“But he cannot now give testimony, Cornelius,” said Dumbledore. He was staring hard at Fudge, as though seeing him plainly
for the first time. “He cannot give evidence about why he killed
those people.”
“Why he killed them? Well, that’s no mystery, is it?” blustered
Fudge. “He was a raving lunatic! From what Minerva and Severus
have told me, he seems to have thought he was doing it all on YouKnow-Who’s instructions!”
“Lord Voldemort was giving him instructions, Cornelius,”
Dumbledore said. “Those people’s deaths were mere by-products
of a plan to restore Voldemort to full strength again. The plan succeeded. Voldemort has been restored to his body.”
Fudge looked as though someone had just swung a heavy weight
into his face. Dazed and blinking, he stared back at Dumbledore as

if he couldn’t quite believe what he had just heard. He began to
sputter, still goggling at Dumbledore.
“You-Know-Who . . . returned? Preposterous. Come now, Dumbledore . . .”
“As Minerva and Severus have doubtless told you,” said Dumbledore, “we heard Barry Crouch confess. Under the influence of
Veritaserum, he told us how he was smuggled out of Azkaban, and
how Voldemort — learning of his continued existence from Bertha
Jorkins — went to free him from his father and used him to capture Harry. The plan worked, I tell you. Crouch has helped Voldemort to return.”
“See here, Dumbledore,” said Fudge, and Harry was astonished
to see a slight smile dawning on his face, “you — you can’t seriously believe that. You-Know-Who — back? Come now, come
now . . . certainly, Crouch may have believed himself to be acting
upon You-Know-Who’s orders — but to take the word of a lunatic
like that, Dumbledore . . .”
“When Harry touched the Triwizard Cup tonight, he was transported straight to Voldemort,” said Dumbledore steadily. “He witnessed Lord Voldemort’s rebirth. I will explain it all to you if you
will step up to my office.”
Dumbledore glanced around at Harry and saw that he was
awake, but shook his head and said, “I am afraid I cannot permit
you to question Harry tonight.”
Fudge’s curious smile lingered. He too glanced at Harry, then
looked back at Dumbledore, and said, “You are — er — prepared
to take Harry’s word on this, are you, Dumbledore?”
There was a moment’s silence, which was broken by Sirius

growling. His hackles were raised, and he was baring his teeth at
Fudge.
“Certainly, I believe Harry,” said Dumbledore. His eyes were
blazing now. “I heard Crouch’s confession, and I heard Harry’s account of what happened after he touched the Triwizard Cup; the
two stories make sense, they explain everything that has happened
since Bertha Jorkins disappeared last summer.”
Fudge still had that strange smile on his face. Once again, he
glanced at Harry before answering.
“You are prepared to believe that Lord Voldemort has returned,
on the word of a lunatic murderer, and a boy who . . . well . . .”
Fudge shot Harry another look, and Harry suddenly understood.
“You’ve been reading Rita Skeeter, Mr. Fudge,” he said quietly.
Ron, Hermione, Mrs. Weasley, and Bill all jumped. None of
them had realized that Harry was awake.
Fudge reddened slightly, but a defiant and obstinate look came
over his face.
“And if I have?” he said, looking at Dumbledore. “If I have discovered that you’ve been keeping certain facts about the boy very
quiet? A Parselmouth, eh? And having funny turns all over the
place —”
“I assume that you are referring to the pains Harry has been experiencing in his scar?” said Dumbledore coolly.
“You admit that he has been having these pains, then?” said Fudge
quickly. “Headaches? Nightmares? Possibly — hallucinations?”
“Listen to me, Cornelius,” said Dumbledore, taking a step toward Fudge, and once again, he seemed to radiate that indefinable


CHAPTER THIRTY-SIX
sense of power that Harry had felt after Dumbledore had Stunned
young Crouch. “Harry is as sane as you or I. That scar upon his
forehead has not addled his brains. I believe it hurts him when
Lord Voldemort is close by, or feeling particularly murderous.”
Fudge had taken half a step back from Dumbledore, but he
looked no less stubborn.
“You’ll forgive me, Dumbledore, but I’ve never heard of a curse
scar acting as an alarm bell before. . . .”
“Look, I saw Voldemort come back!” Harry shouted. He tried to
get out of bed again, but Mrs. Weasley forced him back. “I saw the
Death Eaters! I can give you their names! Lucius Malfoy —”
Snape made a sudden movement, but as Harry looked at him,
Snape’s eyes flew back to Fudge.
“Malfoy was cleared!” said Fudge, visibly affronted. “A very old
family — donations to excellent causes —”
“Macnair!” Harry continued.
“Also cleared! Now working for the Ministry!”
“Avery — Nott — Crabbe — Goyle —”
“You are merely repeating the names of those who were acquitted of being Death Eaters thirteen years ago!” said Fudge angrily.
“You could have found those names in old reports of the trials! For
heaven’s sake, Dumbledore — the boy was full of some crackpot
story at the end of last year too — his tales are getting taller, and
you’re still swallowing them — the boy can talk to snakes, Dumbledore, and you still think he’s trustworthy?”
“You fool!” Professor McGonagall cried. “Cedric Diggory! Mr.
Crouch! These deaths were not the random work of a lunatic!”
“I see no evidence to the contrary!” shouted Fudge, now match

ing her anger, his face purpling. “It seems to me that you are all
determined to start a panic that will destabilize everything we have
worked for these last thirteen years!”
Harry couldn’t believe what he was hearing. He had always
thought of Fudge as a kindly figure, a little blustering, a little
pompous, but essentially good-natured. But now a short, angry
wizard stood before him, refusing, point-blank, to accept the
prospect of disruption in his comfortable and ordered world — to
believe that Voldemort could have risen.
“Voldemort has returned,” Dumbledore repeated. “If you accept
that fact straightaway, Fudge, and take the necessary measures, we
may still be able to save the situation. The first and most essential
step is to remove Azkaban from the control of the dementors —”
“Preposterous!” shouted Fudge again. “Remove the dementors?
I’d be kicked out of office for suggesting it! Half of us only feel safe
in our beds at night because we know the dementors are standing
guard at Azkaban!”
“The rest of us sleep less soundly in our beds, Cornelius, knowing that you have put Lord Voldemort’s most dangerous supporters in the care of creatures who will join him the instant he asks
them!” said Dumbledore. “They will not remain loyal to you,
Fudge! Voldemort can offer them much more scope for their powers and their pleasures than you can! With the dementors behind
him, and his old supporters returned to him, you will be hardpressed to stop him regaining the sort of power he had thirteen
years ago!”
Fudge was opening and closing his mouth as though no words
could express his outrage.

“The second step you must take — and at once,” Dumbledore
pressed on, “is to send envoys to the giants.”
“Envoys to the giants?” Fudge shrieked, finding his tongue
again. “What madness is this?”
“Extend them the hand of friendship, now, before it is too late,”
said Dumbledore, “or Voldemort will persuade them, as he did before, that he alone among wizards will give them their rights and
their freedom!”
“You — you cannot be serious!” Fudge gasped, shaking his head
and retreating further from Dumbledore. “If the magical community got wind that I had approached the giants — people hate
them, Dumbledore — end of my career —”
“You are blinded,” said Dumbledore, his voice rising now, the
aura of power around him palpable, his eyes blazing once more,
“by the love of the office you hold, Cornelius! You place too much
importance, and you always have done, on the so-called purity of
blood! You fail to recognize that it matters not what someone is
born, but what they grow to be! Your dementor has just destroyed
the last remaining member of a pure-blood family as old as any —
and see what that man chose to make of his life! I tell you now —
take the steps I have suggested, and you will be remembered, in
office or out, as one of the bravest and greatest Ministers of Magic
we have ever known. Fail to act — and history will remember you
as the man who stepped aside and allowed Voldemort a second
chance to destroy the world we have tried to rebuild!”
“Insane,” whispered Fudge, still backing away. “Mad . . .”
And then there was silence. Madam Pomfrey was standing
frozen at the foot of Harry’s bed, her hands over her mouth. Mrs.

Weasley was still standing over Harry, her hand on his shoulder to
prevent him from rising. Bill, Ron, and Hermione were staring at
Fudge.
“If your determination to shut your eyes will carry you as far as
this, Cornelius,” said Dumbledore, “we have reached a parting of
the ways. You must act as you see fit. And I — I shall act as I see
fit.”
Dumbledore’s voice carried no hint of a threat; it sounded like a
mere statement, but Fudge bristled as though Dumbledore were
advancing upon him with a wand.
“Now, see here, Dumbledore,” he said, waving a threatening finger. “I’ve given you free rein, always. I’ve had a lot of respect for
you. I might not have agreed with some of your decisions, but I’ve
kept quiet. There aren’t many who’d have let you hire werewolves,
or keep Hagrid, or decide what to teach your students without reference to the Ministry. But if you’re going to work against me —”
“The only one against whom I intend to work,” said Dumbledore, “is Lord Voldemort. If you are against him, then we remain,
Cornelius, on the same side.”
It seemed Fudge could think of no answer to this. He rocked
backward and forward on his small feet for a moment and spun his
bowler hat in his hands. Finally, he said, with a hint of a plea in his
voice, “He can’t be back, Dumbledore, he just can’t be . . .”
Snape strode forward, past Dumbledore, pulling up the left
sleeve of his robes as he went. He stuck out his forearm and showed
it to Fudge, who recoiled.
“There,” said Snape harshly. “There. The Dark Mark. It is not as
clear as it was an hour or so ago, when it burned black, but you can


709

CHAPTER THIRTY-SIX
still see it. Every Death Eater had the sign burned into him by the
Dark Lord. It was a means of distinguishing one another, and his
means of summoning us to him. When he touched the Mark of
any Death Eater, we were to Disapparate, and Apparate, instantly,
at his side. This Mark has been growing clearer all year. Karkaroff ’s
too. Why do you think Karkaroff fled tonight? We both felt the
Mark burn. We both knew he had returned. Karkaroff fears the
Dark Lord’s vengeance. He betrayed too many of his fellow Death
Eaters to be sure of a welcome back into the fold.”
Fudge stepped back from Snape too. He was shaking his head.
He did not seem to have taken in a word Snape had said. He stared,
apparently repelled by the ugly mark on Snape’s arm, then looked
up at Dumbledore and whispered, “I don’t know what you and
your staff are playing at, Dumbledore, but I have heard enough. I
have no more to add. I will be in touch with you tomorrow, Dumbledore, to discuss the running of this school. I must return to the
Ministry.”
He had almost reached the door when he paused. He turned
around, strode back down the dormitory, and stopped at Harry’s
bed.
“Your winnings,” he said shortly, taking a large bag of gold out
of his pocket and dropping it onto Harry’s bedside table. “One
thousand Galleons. There should have been a presentation ceremony, but under the circumstances . . .”
He crammed his bowler hat onto his head and walked out of the
room, slamming the door behind him. The moment he had disappeared, Dumbledore turned to look at the group around Harry’s
bed.

“There is work to be done,” he said. “Molly . . . am I right in
thinking that I can count on you and Arthur?”
“Of course you can,” said Mrs. Weasley. She was white to the
lips, but she looked resolute. “We know what Fudge is. It’s Arthur’s
fondness for Muggles that has held him back at the Ministry all
these years. Fudge thinks he lacks proper wizarding pride.”
“Then I need to send a message to Arthur,” said Dumbledore.
“All those that we can persuade of the truth must be notified immediately, and he is well placed to contact those at the Ministry
who are not as shortsighted as Cornelius.”
“I’ll go to Dad,” said Bill, standing up. “I’ll go now.”
“Excellent,” said Dumbledore. “Tell him what has happened. Tell
him I will be in direct contact with him shortly. He will need to be discreet, however. If Fudge thinks I am interfering at the Ministry —”
“Leave it to me,” said Bill.
He clapped a hand on Harry’s shoulder, kissed his mother on the
cheek, pulled on his cloak, and strode quickly from the room.
“Minerva,” said Dumbledore, turning to Professor McGonagall,
“I want to see Hagrid in my office as soon as possible. Also — if
she will consent to come — Madame Maxime.”
Professor McGonagall nodded and left without a word.
“Poppy,” Dumbledore said to Madam Pomfrey, “would you be
very kind and go down to Professor Moody’s office, where I think
you will find a house-elf called Winky in considerable distress? Do
what you can for her, and take her back to the kitchens. I think
Dobby will look after her for us.”
“Very — very well,” said Madam Pomfrey, looking startled, and
she too left.


711

CHAPTER THIRTY-SIX
Dumbledore made sure that the door was closed, and that
Madam Pomfrey’s footsteps had died away, before he spoke again.
“And now,” he said, “it is time for two of our number to recognize each other for what they are. Sirius . . . if you could resume
your usual form.”
The great black dog looked up at Dumbledore, then, in an instant, turned back into a man.
Mrs. Weasley screamed and leapt back from the bed.
“Sirius Black!” she shrieked, pointing at him.
“Mum, shut up!” Ron yelled. “It’s okay!”
Snape had not yelled or jumped backward, but the look on his
face was one of mingled fury and horror.
“Him!” he snarled, staring at Sirius, whose face showed equal
dislike. “What is he doing here?”
“He is here at my invitation,” said Dumbledore, looking between them, “as are you, Severus. I trust you both. It is time for you
to lay aside your old differences and trust each other.”
Harry thought Dumbledore was asking for a near miracle. Sirius
and Snape were eyeing each other with the utmost loathing.
“I will settle, in the short term,” said Dumbledore, with a bite of
impatience in his voice, “for a lack of open hostility. You will shake
hands. You are on the same side now. Time is short, and unless the
few of us who know the truth do not stand united, there is no hope
for any of us.”
Very slowly — but still glaring at each other as though each
wished the other nothing but ill — Sirius and Snape moved toward
each other and shook hands. They let go extremely quickly.
“That will do to be going on with,” said Dumbledore, stepping

between them once more. “Now I have work for each of you.
Fudge’s attitude, though not unexpected, changes everything. Sirius, I need you to set off at once. You are to alert Remus Lupin,
Arabella Figg, Mundungus Fletcher — the old crowd. Lie low at
Lupins for a while; I will contact you there.”
“But —” said Harry.
He wanted Sirius to stay. He did not want to have to say goodbye again so quickly.
“You’ll see me very soon, Harry,” said Sirius, turning to him. “I
promise you. But I must do what I can, you understand, don’t
you?”
“Yeah,” said Harry. “Yeah . . . of course I do.”
Sirius grasped his hand briefly, nodded to Dumbledore, transformed again into the black dog, and ran the length of the room
to the door, whose handle he turned with a paw. Then he was
gone.
“Severus,” said Dumbledore, turning to Snape, “you know what
I must ask you to do. If you are ready . . . if you are prepared . . .”
“I am,” said Snape.
He looked slightly paler than usual, and his cold, black eyes glittered strangely.
“Then good luck,” said Dumbledore, and he watched, with a
trace of apprehension on his face, as Snape swept wordlessly after
Sirius.
It was several minutes before Dumbledore spoke again.
“I must go downstairs,” he said finally. “I must see the Diggorys.
Harry — take the rest of your potion. I will see all of you later.”
Harry slumped back against his pillows as Dumbledore dis

CHAPTER THIRTY-SIX
appeared. Hermione, Ron, and Mrs. Weasley were all looking at
him. None of them spoke for a very long time.
“You’ve got to take the rest of your potion, Harry,” Mrs. Weasley
said at last. Her hand nudged the sack of gold on his bedside cabinet as she reached for the bottle and the goblet. “You have a good
long sleep. Try and think about something else for a while . . .
think about what you’re going to buy with your winnings!”
“I don’t want that gold,” said Harry in an expressionless voice.
“You have it. Anyone can have it. I shouldn’t have won it. It
should’ve been Cedric’s.”
The thing against which he had been fighting on and off ever
since he had come out of the maze was threatening to overpower
him. He could feel a burning, prickling feeling in the inner corners
of his eyes. He blinked and stared up at the ceiling.
“It wasn’t your fault, Harry,” Mrs. Weasley whispered.
“I told him to take the cup with me,” said Harry.
Now the burning feeling was in his throat too. He wished Ron
would look away.
Mrs. Weasley set the potion down on the bedside cabinet, bent
down, and put her arms around Harry. He had no memory of ever
being hugged like this, as though by a mother. The full weight of
everything he had seen that night seemed to fall in upon him as
Mrs. Weasley held him to her. His mother’s face, his father’s voice,
the sight of Cedric, dead on the ground all started spinning in his
head until he could hardly bear it, until he was screwing up his face
against the howl of misery fighting to get out of him.
There was a loud slamming noise, and Mrs. Weasley and Harry
broke apart. Hermione was standing by the window. She was holding something tight in her hand.


THE PARTING OF

“Sorry,” she whispered.
“Your potion, Harry,” said Mrs. Weasley quickly, wiping her
eyes on the back of her hand.
Harry drank it in one gulp. The effect was instantaneous. Heavy,
irresistible waves of dreamless sleep broke over him; he fell back
onto his pillows and thought no more.

W

hen he looked back, even a month later, Harry found he
had only scattered memories of the next few days. It was
as though he had been through too much to take in any more. The
recollections he did have were very painful. The worst, perhaps,
was the meeting with the Diggorys that took place the following
morning.
They did not blame him for what had happened; on the contrary, both thanked him for returning Cedric’s body to them. Mr.
Diggory sobbed through most of the interview. Mrs. Diggory’s
grief seemed to be beyond tears.
“He suffered very little then,” she said, when Harry had told her
how Cedric had died. “And after all, Amos . . . he died just when
he’d won the tournament. He must have been happy.”
When they got to their feet, she looked down at Harry and said,
“You look after yourself, now.”
Harry seized the sack of gold on the bedside table.


716

THE BEGINNING
“You take this,” he muttered to her. “It should’ve been Cedric’s,
he got there first, you take it —”
But she backed away from him.
“Oh no, it’s yours, dear, I couldn’t . . . you keep it.”
Harry returned to Gryffindor Tower the following evening. From
what Hermione and Ron told him, Dumbledore had spoken to the
school that morning at breakfast. He had merely requested that
they leave Harry alone, that nobody ask him questions or badger
him to tell the story of what had happened in the maze. Most people, he noticed, were skirting him in the corridors, avoiding his
eyes. Some whispered behind their hands as he passed. He guessed
that many of them had believed Rita Skeeter’s article about how
disturbed and possibly dangerous he was. Perhaps they were formulating their own theories about how Cedric had died. He found
he didn’t care very much. He liked it best when he was with Ron
and Hermione and they were talking about other things, or else letting him sit in silence while they played chess. He felt as though all
three of them had reached an understanding they didn’t need to
put into words; that each was waiting for some sign, some word, of
what was going on outside Hogwarts — and that it was useless to
speculate about what might be coming until they knew anything
for certain. The only time they touched upon the subject was when
Ron told Harry about a meeting Mrs. Weasley had had with Dumbledore before going home.
“She went to ask him if you could come straight to us this summer,” he said. “But he wants you to go back to the Dursleys, at least
at first.”
“Why?” said Harry.


717



CHAPTER THIRTY-SEVEN
“She said Dumbledore’s got his reasons,” said Ron, shaking his
head darkly. “I suppose we’ve got to trust him, haven’t we?”
The only person apart from Ron and Hermione that Harry felt
able to talk to was Hagrid. As there was no longer a Defense Against
the Dark Arts teacher, they had those lessons free. They used the
one on Thursday afternoon to go down and visit Hagrid in his
cabin. It was a bright and sunny day; Fang bounded out of the open
door as they approached, barking and wagging his tail madly.
“Who’s that?” called Hagrid, coming to the door. “Harry!”
He strode out to meet them, pulled Harry into a one-armed
hug, ruffled his hair, and said, “Good ter see yeh, mate. Good ter
see yeh.”
They saw two bucket-size cups and saucers on the wooden table
in front of the fireplace when they entered Hagrid’s cabin.
“Bin havin’ a cuppa with Olympe,” Hagrid said. “She’s jus’ left.”
“Who?” said Ron curiously.
“Madame Maxime, o’ course!” said Hagrid.
“You two made up, have you?” said Ron.
“Dunno what yeh’re talkin’ about,” said Hagrid airily, fetching
more cups from the dresser. When he had made tea and offered
around a plate of doughy cookies, he leaned back in his chair and
surveyed Harry closely through his beetle-black eyes.
“You all righ’?” he said gruffly.
“Yeah,” said Harry.
“No, yeh’re not,” said Hagrid. “ ’Course yeh’re not. But yeh will
be.”
Harry said nothing.
“Knew he was goin’ ter come back,” said Hagrid, and Harry,

Ron, and Hermione looked up at him, shocked. “Known it fer
years, Harry. Knew he was out there, bidin’ his time. It had ter happen. Well, now it has, an’ we’ll jus’ have ter get on with it. We’ll
fight. Migh’ be able ter stop him before he gets a good hold. That’s
Dumbledore’s plan, anyway. Great man, Dumbledore. ’S long as
we’ve got him, I’m not too worried.”
Hagrid raised his bushy eyebrows at the disbelieving expressions
on their faces.
“No good sittin’ worryin’ abou’ it,” he said. “What’s comin’ will
come, an’ we’ll meet it when it does. Dumbledore told me wha’ you
did, Harry.”
Hagrid’s chest swelled as he looked at Harry.
“Yeh did as much as yer father would’ve done, an’ I can’ give yeh
no higher praise than that.”
Harry smiled back at him. It was the first time he’d smiled in
days. “What’s Dumbledore asked you to do, Hagrid?” he asked.
“He sent Professor McGonagall to ask you and Madame Maxime
to meet him — that night.”
“Got a little job fer me over the summer,” said Hagrid. “Secret,
though. I’m not s’pposed ter talk abou’ it, no, not even ter you lot.
Olympe — Madame Maxime ter you — might be comin’ with
me. I think she will. Think I got her persuaded.”
“Is it to do with Voldemort?”
Hagrid flinched at the sound of the name.
“Migh’ be,” he said evasively. “Now . . . who’d like ter come an’

hastily, seeing the looks on their faces.

CHAPTER THIRTY-SEVEN
It was with a heavy heart that Harry packed his trunk up in the
dormitory on the night before his return to Privet Drive. He was
dreading the Leaving Feast, which was usually a cause for celebration, when the winner of the Inter-House Championship would be
announced. He had avoided being in the Great Hall when it was
full ever since he had left the hospital wing, preferring to eat when
it was nearly empty to avoid the stares of his fellow students.
When he, Ron, and Hermione entered the Hall, they saw at
once that the usual decorations were missing. The Great Hall was
normally decorated with the winning House’s colors for the Leaving Feast. Tonight, however, there were black drapes on the wall
behind the teachers’ table. Harry knew instantly that they were
there as a mark of respect to Cedric.
The real Mad-Eye Moody was at the staff table now, his wooden
leg and his magical eye back in place. He was extremely twitchy,
jumping every time someone spoke to him. Harry couldn’t blame
him; Moody’s fear of attack was bound to have been increased by
his ten-month imprisonment in his own trunk. Professor Karkaroff ’s chair was empty. Harry wondered, as he sat down with the
other Gryffindors, where Karkaroff was now, and whether Voldemort had caught up with him.
Madame Maxime was still there. She was sitting next to Hagrid.
They were talking quietly together. Further along the table, sitting
next to Professor McGonagall, was Snape. His eyes lingered on
Harry for a moment as Harry looked at him. His expression was
difficult to read. He looked as sour and unpleasant as ever. Harry
continued to watch him, long after Snape had looked away.
What was it that Snape had done on Dumbledore’s orders, the
night that Voldemort had returned? And why . . . why . . . was


720



THE BEGINNING
Dumbledore so convinced that Snape was truly on their side? He
had been their spy, Dumbledore had said so in the Pensieve. Snape
had turned spy against Voldemort, “at great personal risk.” Was
that the job he had taken up again? Had he made contact with the
Death Eaters, perhaps? Pretended that he had never really gone
over to Dumbledore, that he had been, like Voldemort himself,
biding his time?
Harry’s musings were ended by Professor Dumbledore, who
stood up at the staff table. The Great Hall, which in any case had
been less noisy than it usually was at the Leaving Feast, became
very quiet.
“The end,” said Dumbledore, looking around at them all, “of
another year.”
He paused, and his eyes fell upon the Hufflepuff table. Theirs
had been the most subdued table before he had gotten to his feet,
and theirs were still the saddest and palest faces in the Hall.
“There is much that I would like to say to you all tonight,” said
Dumbledore, “but I must first acknowledge the loss of a very fine
person, who should be sitting here,” he gestured toward the Hufflepuffs, “enjoying our feast with us. I would like you all, please, to
stand, and raise your glasses, to Cedric Diggory.”
They did it, all of them; the benches scraped as everyone in the
Hall stood, and raised their goblets, and echoed, in one loud, low,
rumbling voice, “Cedric Diggory.”
Harry caught a glimpse of Cho through the crowd. There were
tears pouring silently down her face. He looked down at the table
as they all sat down again.
“Cedric was a person who exemplified many of the qualities that
distinguish Hufflepuff house,” Dumbledore continued. “He was a


721



CHAPTER THIRTY-SEVEN
good and loyal friend, a hard worker, he valued fair play. His death
has affected you all, whether you knew him well or not. I think that
you have the right, therefore, to know exactly how it came about.”
Harry raised his head and stared at Dumbledore.
“Cedric Diggory was murdered by Lord Voldemort.”
A panicked whisper swept the Great Hall. People were staring at
Dumbledore in disbelief, in horror. He looked perfectly calm as he
watched them mutter themselves into silence.
“The Ministry of Magic,” Dumbledore continued, “does not
wish me to tell you this. It is possible that some of your parents will
be horrified that I have done so — either because they will not believe that Lord Voldemort has returned, or because they think I
should not tell you so, young as you are. It is my belief, however,
that the truth is generally preferable to lies, and that any attempt to
pretend that Cedric died as the result of an accident, or some sort
of blunder of his own, is an insult to his memory.”
Stunned and frightened, every face in the Hall was turned toward
Dumbledore now . . . or almost every face. Over at the Slytherin
table, Harry saw Draco Malfoy muttering something to Crabbe and
Goyle. Harry felt a hot, sick swoop of anger in his stomach. He
forced himself to look back at Dumbledore.
“There is somebody else who must be mentioned in connection
with Cedric’s death,” Dumbledore went on. “I am talking, of course,
about Harry Potter.”
A kind of ripple crossed the Great Hall as a few heads turned in
Harry’s direction before flicking back to face Dumbledore.
“Harry Potter managed to escape Lord Voldemort,” said Dumbledore. “He risked his own life to return Cedric’s body to Hogwarts. He showed, in every respect, the sort of bravery that few


722



THE BEGINNING
wizards have ever shown in facing Lord Voldemort, and for this, I
honor him.”
Dumbledore turned gravely to Harry and raised his goblet once
more. Nearly everyone in the Great Hall followed suit. They murmured his name, as they had murmured Cedric’s, and drank to
him. But through a gap in the standing figures, Harry saw that
Malfoy, Crabbe, Goyle, and many of the other Slytherins had
remained defiantly in their seats, their goblets untouched. Dumbledore, who after all possessed no magical eye, did not see them.
When everyone had once again resumed their seats, Dumbledore continued, “The Triwizard Tournament’s aim was to further
and promote magical understanding. In the light of what has happened — of Lord Voldemort’s return — such ties are more important than ever before.”
Dumbledore looked from Madame Maxime and Hagrid, to
Fleur Delacour and her fellow Beauxbatons students, to Viktor
Krum and the Durmstrangs at the Slytherin table. Krum, Harry
saw, looked wary, almost frightened, as though he expected Dumbledore to say something harsh.
“Every guest in this Hall,” said Dumbledore, and his eyes lingered upon the Durmstrang students, “will be welcomed back
here at any time, should they wish to come. I say to you all, once
again — in the light of Lord Voldemort’s return, we are only as
strong as we are united, as weak as we are divided. Lord Voldemort’s gift for spreading discord and enmity is very great. We can
fight it only by showing an equally strong bond of friendship and
trust. Differences of habit and language are nothing at all if our
aims are identical and our hearts are open.
“It is my belief — and never have I so hoped that I am mis

CHAPTER THIRTY-SEVEN
taken — that we are all facing dark and difficult times. Some of
you in this Hall have already suffered directly at the hands of Lord
Voldemort. Many of your families have been torn asunder. A week
ago, a student was taken from our midst.
“Remember Cedric. Remember, if the time should come when
you have to make a choice between what is right and what is easy,
remember what happened to a boy who was good, and kind, and
brave, because he strayed across the path of Lord Voldemort. Remember Cedric Diggory.”
Harry’s trunk was packed; Hedwig was back in her cage on top of
it. He, Ron, and Hermione were waiting in the crowded entrance
hall with the rest of the fourth years for the carriages that would
take them back to Hogsmeade station. It was another beautiful
summer’s day. He supposed that Privet Drive would be hot and
leafy, its flower beds a riot of color, when he arrived there that
evening. The thought gave him no pleasure at all.
“ ’Arry!”
He looked around. Fleur Delacour was hurrying up the stone
steps into the castle. Beyond her, far across the grounds, Harry
could see Hagrid helping Madame Maxime to back two of the giant horses into their harness. The Beauxbatons carriage was about
to take off.
“We will see each uzzer again, I ’ope,” said Fleur as she reached
him, holding out her hand. “I am ’oping to get a job ’ere, to improve my Eenglish.”
“It’s very good already,” said Ron in a strangled sort of voice.
Fleur smiled at him; Hermione scowled.


724



THE BEGINNING
“Good-bye, ’Arry,” said Fleur, turning to go. “It ’az been a pleasure meeting you!”
Harry’s spirits couldn’t help but lift slightly as he watched Fleur
hurry back across the lawns to Madame Maxime, her silvery hair
rippling in the sunlight.
“Wonder how the Durmstrang students are getting back,” said
Ron. “D’you reckon they can steer that ship without Karkaroff?”
“Karkaroff did not steer,” said a gruff voice. “He stayed in his
cabin and let us do the vork.”
Krum had come to say good-bye to Hermione.
“Could I have a vord?” he asked her.
“Oh . . . yes . . . all right,” said Hermione, looking slightly flustered, and following Krum through the crowd and out of sight.
“You’d better hurry up!” Ron called loudly after her. “The carriages’ll be here in a minute!”
He let Harry keep a watch for the carriages, however, and spent
the next few minutes craning his neck over the crowd to try and see
what Krum and Hermione might be up to. They returned quite
soon. Ron stared at Hermione, but her face was quite impassive.
“I liked Diggory,” said Krum abruptly to Harry. “He vos alvays
polite to me. Alvays. Even though I vos from Durmstrang — with
Karkaroff,” he added, scowling.
“Have you got a new headmaster yet?” said Harry.
Krum shrugged. He held out his hand as Fleur had done, shook
Harry’s hand, and then Ron’s. Ron looked as though he was suffering some sort of painful internal struggle. Krum had already started
walking away when Ron burst out, “Can I have your autograph?”
Hermione turned away, smiling at the horseless carriages that


725



CHAPTER THIRTY-SEVEN
were now trundling toward them up the drive, as Krum, looking
surprised but gratified, signed a fragment of parchment for Ron.
The weather could not have been more different on the journey
back to King’s Cross than it had been on their way to Hogwarts the
previous September. There wasn’t a single cloud in the sky. Harry,
Ron, and Hermione had managed to get a compartment to themselves. Pigwidgeon was once again hidden under Ron’s dress robes
to stop him from hooting continually; Hedwig was dozing, her
head under her wing, and Crookshanks was curled up in a spare
seat like a large, furry ginger cushion. Harry, Ron, and Hermione
talked more fully and freely than they had all week as the train sped
them southward. Harry felt as though Dumbledore’s speech at the
Leaving Feast had unblocked him, somehow. It was less painful to
discuss what had happened now. They broke off their conversation
about what action Dumbledore might be taking, even now, to stop
Voldemort only when the lunch trolley arrived.
When Hermione returned from the trolley and put her money
back into her schoolbag, she dislodged a copy of the Daily Prophet
that she had been carrying in there. Harry looked at it, unsure
whether he really wanted to know what it might say, but Hermione, seeing him looking at it, said calmly, “There’s nothing in
there. You can look for yourself, but there’s nothing at all. I’ve been
checking every day. Just a small piece the day after the third task
saying you won the tournament. They didn’t even mention Cedric.
Nothing about any of it. If you ask me, Fudge is forcing them to
keep quiet.”
“He’ll never keep Rita quiet,” said Harry. “Not on a story like
this.”


726



THE BEGINNING
“Oh, Rita hasn’t written anything at all since the third task,” said
Hermione in an oddly constrained voice. “As a matter of fact,” she
added, her voice now trembling slightly, “Rita Skeeter isn’t going to
be writing anything at all for a while. Not unless she wants me to
spill the beans on her.”
“What are you talking about?” said Ron.
“I found out how she was listening in on private conversations
when she wasn’t supposed to be coming onto the grounds,” said
Hermione in a rush.
Harry had the impression that Hermione had been dying to tell
them this for days, but that she had restrained herself in light of
everything else that had happened.
“How was she doing it?” said Harry at once.
“How did you find out?” said Ron, staring at her.
“Well, it was you, really, who gave me the idea, Harry,” she said.
“Did I?” said Harry, perplexed. “How?”
“Bugging,” said Hermione happily.
“But you said they didn’t work —”
“Oh not electronic bugs,” said Hermione. “No, you see . . . Rita
Skeeter” — Hermione’s voice trembled with quiet triumph — “is an
unregistered Animagus. She can turn —”
Hermione pulled a small sealed glass jar out of her bag.
“— into a beetle.”
“You’re kidding,” said Ron. “You haven’t . . . she’s not . . .”
“Oh yes she is,” said Hermione happily, brandishing the jar at
them.
Inside were a few twigs and leaves and one large, fat beetle.
“That’s never — you’re kidding —” Ron whispered, lifting the
jar to his eyes.

“No, I’m not,” said Hermione, beaming. “I caught her on the
windowsill in the hospital wing. Look very closely, and you’ll notice the markings around her antennae are exactly like those foul
glasses she wears.”
Harry looked and saw that she was quite right. He also remembered something.
“There was a beetle on the statue the night we heard Hagrid
telling Madame Maxime about his mum!”
“Exactly,” said Hermione. “And Viktor pulled a beetle out of my
hair after we’d had our conversation by the lake. And unless I’m
very much mistaken, Rita was perched on the windowsill of the
Divination class the day your scar hurt. She’s been buzzing around
for stories all year.”
“When we saw Malfoy under that tree . . .” said Ron slowly.
“He was talking to her, in his hand,” said Hermione. “He knew,
of course. That’s how she’s been getting all those nice little interviews with the Slytherins. They wouldn’t care that she was doing
something illegal, as long as they were giving her horrible stuff
about us and Hagrid.”
Hermione took the glass jar back from Ron and smiled at the
beetle, which buzzed angrily against the glass.
“I’ve told her I’ll let her out when we get back to London,” said
Hermione. “I’ve put an Unbreakable Charm on the jar, you see, so
she can’t transform. And I’ve told her she’s to keep her quill to herself for a whole year. See if she can’t break the habit of writing horrible lies about people.”
Smiling serenely, Hermione placed the beetle back inside her
schoolbag.
The door of the compartment slid open.

THE BEGINNING
“Very clever, Granger,” said Draco Malfoy.
Crabbe and Goyle were standing behind him. All three of them
looked more pleased with themselves, more arrogant and more
menacing, than Harry had ever seen them.
“So,” said Malfoy slowly, advancing slightly into the compartment and looking slowly around at them, a smirk quivering on his
lips. “You caught some pathetic reporter, and Potter’s Dumbledore’s favorite boy again. Big deal.”
His smirk widened. Crabbe and Goyle leered.
“Trying not to think about it, are we?” said Malfoy softly, looking around at all three of them. “Trying to pretend it hasn’t
happened?”
“Get out,” said Harry.
He had not been this close to Malfoy since he had watched him
muttering to Crabbe and Goyle during Dumbledore’s speech
about Cedric. He could feel a kind of ringing in his ears. His hand
gripped his wand under his robes.
“You’ve picked the losing side, Potter! I warned you! I told you
you ought to choose your company more carefully, remember?
When we met on the train, first day at Hogwarts? I told you not to
hang around with riffraff like this!” He jerked his head at Ron and
Hermione. “Too late now, Potter! They’ll be the first to go, now the
Dark Lord’s back! Mudbloods and Muggle-lovers first! Well — second — Diggory was the f —”
It was as though someone had exploded a box of fireworks
within the compartment. Blinded by the blaze of the spells that
had blasted from every direction, deafened by a series of bangs,
Harry blinked and looked down at the floor.
Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle were all lying unconscious in the

doorway. He, Ron, and Hermione were on their feet, all three of
them having used a different hex. Nor were they the only ones to
have done so.
“Thought we’d see what those three were up to,” said Fred matterof-factly, stepping onto Goyle and into the compartment. He had
his wand out, and so did George, who was careful to tread on Malfoy as he followed Fred inside.
“Interesting effect,” said George, looking down at Crabbe.
“Who used the Furnunculus Curse?”
“Me,” said Harry.
“Odd,” said George lightly. “I used Jelly-Legs. Looks as though
those two shouldn’t be mixed. He seems to have sprouted little tentacles all over his face. Well, let’s not leave them here, they don’t
add much to the decor.”
Ron, Harry, and George kicked, rolled, and pushed the unconscious Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle — each of whom looked distinctly the worse for the jumble of jinxes with which they had been
hit — out into the corridor, then came back into the compartment
and rolled the door shut.
“Exploding Snap, anyone?” said Fred, pulling out a pack of
cards.
They were halfway through their fifth game when Harry decided to ask them.
“You going to tell us, then?” he said to George. “Who you were
blackmailing?”
“Oh,” said George darkly. “That.”
“It doesn’t matter,” said Fred, shaking his head impatiently. “It
wasn’t anything important. Not now, anyway.”
“We’ve given up,” said George, shrugging.

But Harry, Ron, and Hermione kept on asking, and finally, Fred
said, “All right, all right, if you really want to know . . . it was Ludo
Bagman.”
“Bagman?” said Harry sharply. “Are you saying he was involved
in —”
“Nah,” said George gloomily. “Nothing like that. Stupid git. He
wouldn’t have the brains.”
“Well, what, then?” said Ron.
Fred hesitated, then said, “You remember that bet we had with
him at the Quidditch World Cup? About how Ireland would win,
but Krum would get the Snitch?”
“Yeah,” said Harry and Ron slowly.
“Well, the git paid us in leprechaun gold he’d caught from the
Irish mascots.”
“So?”
“So,” said Fred impatiently, “it vanished, didn’t it? By next
morning, it had gone!”
“But — it must’ve been an accident, mustn’t it?” said Hermione.
George laughed very bitterly.
“Yeah, that’s what we thought, at first. We thought if we just
wrote to him, and told him he’d made a mistake, he’d cough up.
But nothing doing. Ignored our letter. We kept trying to talk to
him about it at Hogwarts, but he was always making some excuse
to get away from us.”
“In the end, he turned pretty nasty,” said Fred. “Told us we were
too young to gamble, and he wasn’t giving us anything.”
“So we asked for our money back,” said George glowering.
“He didn’t refuse!” gasped Hermione.
“Right in one,” said Fred.

“But that was all your savings!” said Ron.
“Tell me about it,” said George. “ ’Course, we found out what
was going on in the end. Lee Jordan’s dad had had a bit of trouble
getting money off Bagman as well. Turns out he’s in big trouble
with the goblins. Borrowed loads of gold off them. A gang of them
cornered him in the woods after the World Cup and took all the
gold he had, and it still wasn’t enough to cover all his debts. They
followed him all the way to Hogwarts to keep an eye on him. He’s
lost everything gambling. Hasn’t got two Galleons to rub together.
And you know how the idiot tried to pay the goblins back?”
“How?” said Harry.
“He put a bet on you, mate,” said Fred. “Put a big bet on you to
win the tournament. Bet against the goblins.”
“So that’s why he kept trying to help me win!” said Harry.
“Well — I did win, didn’t I? So he can pay you your gold!”
“Nope,” said George, shaking his head. “The goblins play as
dirty as him. They say you drew with Diggory, and Bagman was
betting you’d win outright. So Bagman had to run for it. He did
run for it right after the third task.”
George sighed deeply and started dealing out the cards again.
The rest of the journey passed pleasantly enough; Harry wished
it could have gone on all summer, in fact, and that he would never
arrive at King’s Cross . . . but as he had learned the hard way that
year, time will not slow down when something unpleasant lies
ahead, and all too soon, the Hogwarts Express was pulling in at
platform nine and three-quarters. The usual confusion and noise
filled the corridors as the students began to disembark. Ron and
Hermione struggled out past Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle, carrying
their trunks. Harry, however, stayed put.

THE BEGINNING
“Fred — George — wait a moment.”
The twins turned. Harry pulled open his trunk and drew out his
Triwizard winnings.
“Take it,” he said, and he thrust the sack into George’s hands.
“What?” said Fred, looking flabbergasted.
“Take it,” Harry repeated firmly. “I don’t want it.”
“You’re mental,” said George, trying to push it back at Harry.
“No, I’m not,” said Harry. “You take it, and get inventing. It’s
for the joke shop.”
“He is mental,” Fred said in an almost awed voice.
“Listen,” said Harry firmly. “If you don’t take it, I’m throwing it
down the drain. I don’t want it and I don’t need it. But I could do
with a few laughs. We could all do with a few laughs. I’ve got a feeling we’re going to need them more than usual before long.”
“Harry,” said George weakly, weighing the money bag in his
hands, “there’s got to be a thousand Galleons in here.”
“Yeah,” said Harry, grinning. “Think how many Canary Creams
that is.”
The twins stared at him.
“Just don’t tell your mum where you got it . . . although she
might not be so keen for you to join the Ministry anymore, come
to think of it. . . .”
“Harry,” Fred began, but Harry pulled out his wand.
“Look,” he said flatly, “take it, or I’ll hex you. I know some good
ones now. Just do me one favor, okay? Buy Ron some different dress
robes and say they’re from you.”
He left the compartment before they could say another word,
stepping over Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle, who were still lying on
the floor, covered in hex marks.

Uncle Vernon was waiting beyond the barrier. Mrs. Weasley was
close by him. She hugged Harry very tightly when she saw him and
whispered in his ear, “I think Dumbledore will let you come to us
later in the summer. Keep in touch, Harry.”
“See you, Harry,” said Ron, clapping him on the back.
“ ’Bye, Harry!” said Hermione, and she did something she had
never done before, and kissed him on the cheek.
“Harry — thanks,” George muttered, while Fred nodded fervently at his side.
Harry winked at them, turned to Uncle Vernon, and followed
him silently from the station. There was no point worrying yet, he
told himself, as he got into the back of the Dursleys’ car.
As Hagrid had said, what would come, would come . . . and he
would have to meet it when it did.
